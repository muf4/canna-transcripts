[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I feel like I'm off on a schedule or
the plant is showing signs of like under
[SPEAKER_01]: food or too much food then it gives me an
immediate idea of like how much I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: either dial back the FloraFlex or give
them a little more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any kind of training method that's out
there I've probably tried it with an auto
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't see any significant
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well honestly after like a year of doing
that and just seeing what was coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Heavenstown running 18.6 and then
seeing what was coming out of my tent in
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 I felt like there was no there was no
real difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are planning on transplanting them
it's on a timeline you have to keep that
[SPEAKER_04]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: All these like theories I guess against
autos when they're like don't tap don't do
[SPEAKER_04]: this or don't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: All it comes down to is two things your
timeline and your genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 54.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Hi Again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you know them from their YouTube
channel Hi Again which has nearly 20,000
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very big into growing auto
flowers and that's what we're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast or Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Spider Farmer for sponsoring
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer has recently redesigned
their SF series LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the old version the Samsung diodes are
close together resulting in the light
[SPEAKER_00]: being more focused towards the center of
the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the new version the Samsung diodes are
spaced out resulting in a better light
[SPEAKER_00]: spread across the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to a Spider Farmer
website and their Amazon store down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below and you can use
discount code MrGrowIt5 during checkout
[SPEAKER_00]: for a discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Dutch Pro for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch Pro products are now available in
several countries across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know Dutch Pro
is a plant fertilizer company that has
[SPEAKER_00]: base nutrients additives and pH
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different formulas of base
nutrients for if you're in soil or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in hydro or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also formulate their base nutrients
for if you're using hard water or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using RO or soft water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Dutch Pro's Amazon

[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is a sponsor of the podcast
coupon code MrGrowIt will get you a
[SPEAKER_00]: discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their Cloudline T6 and T4
inline fans for several years now and I
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely love the automation built into
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inline fans controller you can have
set points for high and low temperature as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as high and low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This greatly helps control my indoor
garden environment so the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity stays in the ideal ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to AC Infinity down in
the description section below and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: forget to use coupon code MrGrowIt for a

[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Hi again.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have you on board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is new for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'm only interviewing one person
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time I've got to interview two people
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something a little bit different for
this podcast but I figured why not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you guys come as a team there as
a group.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah we are a package deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We bounce off each other so it's hard not
to you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it's just not the same when one
person is gone you don't get the dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I figured.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah let's talk about some autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk all about autoflowers today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get deep into it and really find
out what you guys do in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that starts with me because I as
like I was telling you before I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: observing you know the growth of plants in
my whole life even though it wasn't legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know and it's always been something
that I've been interested in and even just
[SPEAKER_04]: growing plants in general has always been
pretty interesting for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when it became legal here in Michigan
it was almost a no-brainer for me to just
[SPEAKER_04]: like to try it myself because obviously I
am a user of the plant and it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: something that I just knew that I was
going to be interested in and so I started
[SPEAKER_04]: growing myself and like really right in
the beginning is right when I met Neil so
[SPEAKER_04]: he just kind of jumped on it along with
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah and when I met her is when she was
growing and I of course when it came up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan to vote for it like heck yeah I
voted for it and it passed and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: and it kind of fell by the wayside like I
wasn't like gung-ho about growing but I
[SPEAKER_01]: was like I voted for it because I was like
heck yeah it should be legal and heck yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I want to grow it someday.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then after I saw her growing it kind
of like got me excited about it and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: had ordered her some seeds for her
birthday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some sour diesel autos and then that was
like our introduction to auto because I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know there was a difference when I
ordered them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just like auto sounds impressive.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea that it was even there was
even a difference in plants when he
[SPEAKER_04]: ordered them we had no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but then we just kind of fell in love
with the autos and then that you know we
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing those and started the
YouTube and that's kind of what got us
[SPEAKER_01]: into I guess where we are now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just thought hey you know as beginners
we we wanted to show show you know really
[SPEAKER_04]: that if we can do it anybody can do it
like if and we don't know what we're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had no clue so it's almost like we want
to just show people that if if they want
[SPEAKER_04]: to they can do it yeah so that's kind of
kind of just snowballed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome yeah it does take some
learning right some patience in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it but definitely anybody can learn how
to do it I think yeah that's really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: how both of you kind of came together like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are in the same garden right
what's your style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoor outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you soil, cocoa, hydro, organic,
synthetic?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well we started organic and that was
actually at my house.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually don't we actually don't live
together so in the state of Michigan we
[SPEAKER_04]: can have 12 plants per household so we
actually have two different grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so we can afford the luxury of
basically you know we're we see each other
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as we can we live like an hour
away from each other so it makes it hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the content and stuff like that
but we're doing the best we can but
[SPEAKER_01]: basically like heaven has her own grow
which is the five by five and then I have
[SPEAKER_01]: like the four by four so we're not
necessarily growing the same stuff or
[SPEAKER_01]: styles we've been like going crazy you
know trying all these different things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can and just having fun with it so
we do have like our each our own grow that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're both like involved with but not
directly I guess.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm growing more organic and actually
lately and you know is actually ending one
[SPEAKER_04]: of his first runs with with synthetic yeah
I was we were both doing organics I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually started with organics I've been
using nature's living soil I've actually
[SPEAKER_04]: tried dry amendments and I really love
that and actually I get to learn the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: and what it's telling me I feel like and I
get to learn it and an accelerated rate
[SPEAKER_04]: with autos yeah because every plants
different every plants showing me in a
[SPEAKER_04]: different way and I have to learn okay
this is what that means with this kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype so I feel like I'm learning at
almost an accelerated rate with autos but
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I'm growing organic so you are
actually yeah I started to doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: organics we were kind of doing the same
thing like dry amendments and like what we
[SPEAKER_01]: saw like watching Mr. Canucks and like all
the videos we've seen online but then I so
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried that for basically the last year
and then switched over recently to try
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa and like floor flax and synthetic
newts I mean it's like completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different you know like I'm not used it's
a whole different thing but I almost kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like it in a way so you know it just
gives us some flexibility to try different
[SPEAKER_01]: things with our grows and you know we're
always just bouncing ideas off each other
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're actually doing something on our
channel right now we're actually
[SPEAKER_04]: documenting right now
[SPEAKER_00]: so for autos in particular container size
is a big thing right so some people will
[SPEAKER_00]: start in a small container you know small
solo cup and then they'll transplant up
[SPEAKER_00]: into different size containers some people
are adamant that you should be starting in
[SPEAKER_00]: your final container right so let's start
like a three or a five gallon grill pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they'll keep that plant in that
container for the entire life what
[SPEAKER_00]: container size are you typically in and do
you do transplanting like that or what I
[SPEAKER_04]: think you should start this one well I I
actually am for the transplant and I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually have a couple reasons why I do
that but I don't think I'm really just
[SPEAKER_04]: totally one side or the other I just feel
like the transplant is just easier for my
[SPEAKER_04]: my lifestyle honestly I don't feel like
putting it in the final pot or
[SPEAKER_04]: transplanting it is doing too much of harm
but I do think that there is that fine
[SPEAKER_04]: line you there's a time there's definitely
a time where it gets past where it's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: an auto so it's on a timeline you have to
think about that throughout seed to the
[SPEAKER_04]: end no matter what anyway so for me I do
the transplant but I do that because
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes seeds don't make it and I don't
want a whole pot that I made up and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know I'm I have a perpetual grow so it's
almost like that pot will just sit around
[SPEAKER_04]: if it doesn't have something in it so for
me it's easier to just wait that nine to
[SPEAKER_04]: eleven days before I transplant them to
make sure but for Neil I think you do it
[SPEAKER_01]: differently yeah so heavens pretty much
always done certain solo cups and then
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant into final pot I've pretty much
always gone like I'll germinate them and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just do the paper towel method like ghetto
sound but it works good so we I mean we
[SPEAKER_01]: stick in with that so I just wait till
it's got a pretty good taproot on it and
[SPEAKER_01]: then put it in the final pot and that's
the way I've pretty much always done ours
[SPEAKER_01]: but we've seen so many comments about like
oh you can't transplant or don't start in
[SPEAKER_01]: a small thing with autos like honestly
over the the year or so that we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the channel and it grows like
heavens autos that she's always done solo
[SPEAKER_01]: cup to final pot you know huge the huge
ones ones that turn out five feet tall and
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just insane and it's you know she
transplanted them and people are like oh
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't do like I feel like there's
definitely some myths and things but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just we try everything like we don't care
we'll see what happens but again as with
[SPEAKER_04]: autos I just feel like it's on a timeline
even even the transplant is on a timeline
[SPEAKER_04]: your feeding is on a timeline no matter
what with autos it's on a timeline so if
[SPEAKER_04]: you are planning on transplanting them
it's on a timeline you have to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind I agree yeah you definitely got to
do it on time because if it does come root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound in that small container it could
lead to a stun growth which like you said
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on a timeline
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are benefits too so I've done
both I've you know started in the final
[SPEAKER_00]: container and then I've also done the solo
cup and then transplant up I haven't done
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to really have a solid opinion on
it you know what I mean actually I did try
[SPEAKER_04]: that one time I did try that
[SPEAKER_04]: it was like a three transplant with the
plant itself was very healthy actually it
[SPEAKER_04]: just didn't get very big but it never ran
out of nutrients like it was always it was
[SPEAKER_04]: it was always okay being pretty flame
actually yeah because I assume you're
[SPEAKER_00]: probably transplanting into soil that has
amended with some sort of nutrition so
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah as you transplant up you're basically
feeding the plant in a sense right because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a new medium on that one and then
some people will swear by transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: because they want the opportunity to have
access to the root zone to sprinkle
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes on there right so micro as a
fungi is one of them that is an extension
[SPEAKER_00]: of the root zone it's gonna help with
nutrient uptake and that's best applied
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's directly onto the roots so some
people are like yes transplant always
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant they're hardcore transplanters
because of that reason alone so there are
[SPEAKER_00]: so many different ways to go about it I
was just wondering how you guys went about
[SPEAKER_01]: the autos you know yeah we love it we say
you gotta grow to know so if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: curious we can try it I haven't tried all
the methods there is out there to
[SPEAKER_04]: transplant and honestly I'd like to try
more so if people have techniques that I
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't heard of you can totally throw my
way absolutely yeah always welcome
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the comment section of this
video if you're tuning in on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: comment section share some best practices
I love that I love when people able to
[SPEAKER_00]: share their experience on how they do
things because others can read and learn
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially implement their garden so
that's one thing I love about the
[SPEAKER_00]: community let's talk about plant training
a little bit so we'll start with topping
[SPEAKER_00]: topping auto flowers that's another
controversial thing right you can't top
[SPEAKER_00]: autos you can't top autos some people do
it some people swear by it what do you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys a stance on topping autos I feel like
if the plant wants it yeah it definitely
[SPEAKER_04]: does it depends completely I feel like
again the the timing of it and in genetics
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah I mean in my opinion when we feel me
we've talked how many we talked a lot we
[SPEAKER_01]: tried a bunch in the groceries we tried
multi tops just single tops yeah I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like what we found for autos that seems to
work the best is like if it's one that is
[SPEAKER_01]: over performing or like getting tall
really quickly like after around it has
[SPEAKER_01]: like five nodes we'll usually top it only
once because we've tried like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: topping multiple times it just always
seems to cause more stress than anything
[SPEAKER_01]: so it seems like you know early on maybe
day 25 to 30 and just if you're gonna tap
[SPEAKER_01]: it just a single single time on the main
ones is what we seem to work so bad but
[SPEAKER_01]: we've definitely done both and you know
it's definitely some perform and turn out
[SPEAKER_01]: great it gives you a really even canopy
and like you know we usually do trim off
[SPEAKER_04]: also the bottom nodes early instead of
topping I feel like taking the bottom
[SPEAKER_04]: nodes off seems to do a lot better for the
plant because the bottom nodes never end
[SPEAKER_04]: up being anything substantial anyway
that's what we've noticed for the auto so
[SPEAKER_01]: we always like that's the first thing we
chop actually like the earliest probably
[SPEAKER_01]: day 20 23 we'll cut the very bottom two
nodes because they never really end up
[SPEAKER_01]: growing out to be anything so it's like
get rid of them as soon as possible give
[SPEAKER_01]: it a little time to recover and if it is
still beasting out then we would usually
[SPEAKER_04]: do a top but again with autos it's on a
timeline yeah yeah I know some people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have you know some of these genetics are
just so vigorous so vigorous especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you put them in the right media like an
airy medium with cocoa and you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: all that oxygen the root zone it's just
real optimized VPD CO2 all that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: where they're running into height issues
right you think of autos you think of them
[SPEAKER_00]: being real small and stuff yeah some
people want to top autos and for height
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons and also to reshape the plant
right once you top that apical meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: that that main shoot it's gonna promote
growth on those lower branches so it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: help with kind of an even canopy and stuff
like that so there are benefits there but
[SPEAKER_00]: the folks on the other side are saying
yeah any sort of stunting growth on autos
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime you top is gonna reduce your yield
so I think that's another controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: thing where you just gotta do it and try
it out for yourself
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like all these like theories I
guess against autos when they're like
[SPEAKER_04]: don't top don't transplant don't do this
or don't do that all it comes down to is
[SPEAKER_04]: two things your timeline in your genetics
that's it I mean when you really come
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what it is so when people say don't
do this or don't do that I mean where are
[SPEAKER_04]: you getting this information from how do
you know yeah because you didn't try this
[SPEAKER_04]: strain with that you know you can't really
say we've noticed that the auto genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't definitely as solid as like photos
so you know the one that we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff with is that one that's like
performing like ridiculous and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting up super tall like real fast and
it's like well we better do something
[SPEAKER_01]: about that you can pretty much either only
tie it over or you can tap it but it
[SPEAKER_01]: usually if it's growing so vigorously that
we think that way you know it's gonna if
[SPEAKER_01]: you top it it's still gonna do pretty good
like it's gonna recover quickly and just
[SPEAKER_04]: keep growing like I don't I don't know if
I prefer the topping method yeah we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: every time it just kind of plant dictates
yeah what we do yeah now how about low
[SPEAKER_00]: stress training that's something that's
often done in order again to get an even
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy and help with even colicized across
the plant and stuff like that and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very common with autoflowers do you do low
stress training at all yeah yeah we do we
[SPEAKER_01]: do on the tieover method we use a big I'm
a big fan of the garden stakes because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're easily positionable and you can
start to train it even if the arms aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: or the branches aren't to the edge of the
pot like some of the tie-down ones I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's just easier to move around so
we've been using the garden stakes mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: in the basement autoflowers training bags
those are bound to we've been using those
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know we'll usually tie it over or
just like light branch stuff kind of some
[SPEAKER_01]: more tieovers lately as we control the
height and trying to get a really even
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy without stressing it too hard so
that's usually tying it over at an earlier
[SPEAKER_04]: age or that's what I've been implementing
recently and my grow is just the tieover
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't I don't even know if it really
it helps necessarily yield versus just
[SPEAKER_04]: letting it grow on its own I don't I don't
necessarily think that I think that the
[SPEAKER_04]: plants gonna give you what it's gonna give
you in in that's just my opinion because
[SPEAKER_04]: I've we've tried low stress training I've
tried Christmas treeing it I've tried
[SPEAKER_04]: topping I've tried I mean any any kind of
training method that's out there I've
[SPEAKER_04]: probably tried it with an auto and and I
don't see any significant difference I
[SPEAKER_04]: would say if anything maybe low stress
training maybe tying it over would give me
[SPEAKER_04]: better light to my bud sites but other
than that I'd see no real benefit behind
[SPEAKER_00]: like yield that's interesting you say that
I've kind of the opposite in a sense where
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grew now of course we're talking from
seed different phenotypes each seed so
[SPEAKER_00]: everything didn't grow differently it's
gonna depend on what generation they're on
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that but I had ten
autoflowers all the same cultivar and I
[SPEAKER_00]: did some of my did low stress training on
some of my just grew naturally Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: tree style and the ones I did low stress
training on actually yielded more than the
[SPEAKER_00]: normal bleak grown out ones that were
grown Christmas tree style so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: personally a big fan of low stress
training but like you said everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's different I think it does come
down to genetics for sure it's just it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so hard to measure especially since
they're all different phenos like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no there's no cloning of autos like you
can clone an auto but it's not really that
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial since it's on that timeline
like you mentioned you're not really gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: get too much out of it as you would if you
were to just plant a seed and grow that so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I do think you definitely can see
better results though when because when
[SPEAKER_01]: you do tie it over and train it you know
I'll depend on genetics and how the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: grow goes but if you can get even like
penetration to the whole plant rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: the top down because like we have the par
meter we've tested like the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant versus your your bottom dogs
hundreds of pars difference between that
[SPEAKER_01]: you know so if you can get as even
impossible and then control your light
[SPEAKER_01]: like of course you you should have better
yields because everything is getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: same it's not like just the top dogs are
getting the best light everything down is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting just kind of the lower par that's
not gonna I found that when we do when we
[SPEAKER_04]: do our autos like when when you start to
stress train like that or do your training
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like the plant just focuses its
energy on a certain few and it just does
[SPEAKER_04]: that no matter what it doesn't yield you
more in the end it just gives you maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: better flowers and that's just in my
opinion I guess maybe people may have
[SPEAKER_04]: different opinions but I do think that I
love low stress training because again you
[SPEAKER_04]: do get better flowers out of it and I
don't know about yield but if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for a beautiful flower like I do I
love stress train all the time it's my
[SPEAKER_04]: preferred we're always changing up what
we're doing I mean I've been liking it
[SPEAKER_00]: though yeah I do like tying over it
definitely makes it fun now how about
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation of autos some people like to
go in there and pluck off leaves you know
[SPEAKER_00]: for whatever reason they do it whether it
be increased airflow throughout the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or in order to get light down and into the
the canopy do you defoliate if so what's
[SPEAKER_01]: your method for it yeah I've kind of gone
to primarily like leaf tucking at least
[SPEAKER_01]: early on I know some people like gung-ho
about chopping but I don't know I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've kind of fall back to more leaf
tucking as much as I can but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely certain autos that are just way
more busy and way more bushy and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to go in and start like just it
gets so thick like you're gonna be prone
[SPEAKER_01]: to issues and you know I always at least
try and trim out the bottom portion at
[SPEAKER_01]: least the bottom third to get the airflow
and kind of keep everything good you know
[SPEAKER_01]: trim up the bottom side branches and then
just selective leak I could just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: groom through it to make sure like what I
want to be exposed we actually just put a
[SPEAKER_04]: video out of defoliation but again like he
said I try to leaf tuck as much as
[SPEAKER_04]: possible until my leaves are covering
bedside and then I'll just get rid of them
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people will try you know
to leaf tuck as much as possible but I
[SPEAKER_04]: just find sometimes it just ends up
hindering the plant so you gotta really
[SPEAKER_04]: just read your plan just you know you
gotta you gotta become one with your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely let's flip it up let's talk
about nutrients so what nutrients I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you said you were organic and so what
nutrient line are you using and how often
[SPEAKER_01]: you doing feedings me well since I
recently switched I've been using flora
[SPEAKER_01]: flex with cocoa and man I'm just following
the schedule dumping dumping the water in
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's going amazing it feels like
cheating it feels like scientists have
[SPEAKER_01]: already figured it out it's been flawless
it's be some out there's one in there that
[SPEAKER_01]: man I know it's not even I'm not even
gonna call it an auto because it's at day
[SPEAKER_01]: 74 and it's like barely starting to bud so
I'm probably gonna run that thing over the
[SPEAKER_03]: snowblower tomorrow yeah we're gonna
probably have there's gonna be a bit cool
[SPEAKER_01]: office slow motion I do but it's just
taking too long so I'm like forget that
[SPEAKER_01]: one so you like in the floor flex yeah
actually I think it's pretty great like
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really opposed to organics or
synthetics but I mean simplicity you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to follow I don't like you add
it to my tap water and in the pH is
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect like all I do is mix up the powder
and dump it through the cocoa and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the big thing is just watering more with
cocoa I definitely compared to organics
[SPEAKER_01]: and what we were doing so heavens been
running organically like I currently I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: running at nature's living soil which is
an organic mix and I just mix that with HP
[SPEAKER_04]: the pro mix and I also use some worm
castings and the harvest hero a little
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite a little bit more airy just
because that we see seem to find the autos
[SPEAKER_01]: like it with at least something in there
to make it more area if it's a cocoa or
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite or both or whatever you want to
throw in there so that's what I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: running and I think I'm dialing it in
pretty well it's taken me quite a while to
[SPEAKER_04]: really figure it out but again I feel like
I'm learning an accelerated rate and every
[SPEAKER_04]: phenotype is different and it's it's it's
hard it's hard with autos yeah I mean it's
[SPEAKER_04]: easy but it's hard at the same time that's
like one thing for people getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: autos like yeah they're fun and they're
accelerated but there's like also kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: no second chances oh yeah you gotta learn
it and move yeah cuz the plants gonna keep
[SPEAKER_01]: going like it wants to go so if you're
ready with nutrients or not especially
[SPEAKER_01]: like learning with dry amendments which
take time to break down so you got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: okay with just letting things go yeah like
it's it's a learning process maybe that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why the flora flex is doing so well
because it's like immediate feeding like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not waiting for this to break down
always did it break down a week later than
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted it to when the plant needed it
yeah it's just like flora flex I'm just
[SPEAKER_04]: like dumping in what it looks like it
means I feel like as a new grower and
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it organically is so hard because
you have to understand that you need to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand the soil and not only the plant
and a lot of people don't understand that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're not only reading the plant you're
reading your soil and this is something
[SPEAKER_04]: that I've like it's like I've been so
resistant really to learning about my soil
[SPEAKER_04]: and more about the plant and I feel like
that's something that I need to be more
[SPEAKER_04]: aware of and I need to advocate really
more for because I haven't been doing and
[SPEAKER_04]: so relationship yeah it really is so with
organics like I said you're not only
[SPEAKER_04]: reading the plant you're reading the soil
and you need to know that your soil is
[SPEAKER_04]: also healthy and if your soil is not
healthy your plants not gonna be healthy
[SPEAKER_04]: so those are things that I need to
overcome as far as like an organic grower
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great way to put it I
mean they need time to break down right so
[SPEAKER_00]: those worm castings that you're adding in
and the nature of living soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever amendments are within that
microbes need to break those down first
[SPEAKER_00]: and put them into a form that's available
for the plant to uptake right so it does
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a little bit of a waiting period
there so you know if you're seeing a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency then you might want to have
move on to something that's kind of more
[SPEAKER_00]: fast-acting versus like a top dress of
amendments you know what I mean yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly and I think we definitely had a
learning curve of where we were learning
[SPEAKER_01]: that like we were just using dry
amendments and we're hitting issues and it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes too long for what we're trying to
mix in to get to the plant like how can
[SPEAKER_01]: you you know how do you correct all these
different issues immediately with autos
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to you know so it's like
it's a learning curve but it's a fun one
[SPEAKER_01]: like we've never had any so awful that we
just throw the whole thing away you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like something always good as least
is coming out even though we're still
[SPEAKER_01]: learning so it's fun to try new things and
learn every time and we've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: having a blast with it so for the you said
nature's living soil and then worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings when do you typically apply the
worm castings and then also is there any
[SPEAKER_04]: other amendments that you're adding
throughout the grow well I've been doing
[SPEAKER_04]: right in the beginning of flower which is
I would say like around week five or six I
[SPEAKER_04]: would start doing its flower girl which is
a top dress with nature's living soil I've
[SPEAKER_04]: started doing that but I actually started
something new where I've been amending it
[SPEAKER_04]: with the regular nature's living soil
first and then the next week doing the
[SPEAKER_04]: flower girl which is new and I think it's
working for me yeah but but then I then I
[SPEAKER_04]: just top dress it every week and allow it
to feed the plant throughout the week
[SPEAKER_04]: every now and again I'll give it some
molasses and some recharge just to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure they're good but that's probably
maybe once to twice every two weeks so
[SPEAKER_00]: okay that makes sense that's the organic
side and then Neil on the synthetic side
[SPEAKER_00]: with the floor flex are you following
their feeding schedule that they have like
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know they have different ratios for
the feeding schedule are you doing like a
[SPEAKER_01]: full dose with that or what yeah so they
do have a auto flower specific schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can get from floor flex it's
basically just like half of their photo
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding schedule like half the amounts
pretty much it looks like so at first I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought you didn't need cow mag because I
saw like a bunch of them said no cow mag
[SPEAKER_01]: like mix but those were I realized later
all for photos so I did find that when I
[SPEAKER_01]: was growing the autos I did see a little
bit of spotting like brown spots crop up
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just started giving a little bit of
cow mag and that went away immediately and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been kind of tapering that off
now that they're kind of heavy into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like what's in the spoiler
alert they look amazing yeah it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: ridiculous like I'm pretty sure it's
probably gonna be at least six ounces from
[SPEAKER_01]: just the look of it and it's you know just
the very first run I was definitely behind
[SPEAKER_01]: under feeding for a while because I wasn't
sure like do I just start feeding the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor flex immediately at seedling I was
like that seems like it might be spicy so
[SPEAKER_01]: I started it in like a cocoa loco mix and
then for probably the first two weeks I
[SPEAKER_01]: just gave it water because I did give it
like I did like a one gram of floor flex
[SPEAKER_01]: for a gallon and then that seemed to get
him a little yellow and heavens like maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: just let him go naturally because they do
have you know enough in them to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: at least they're like their first little
set of leaves it's like just the seedling
[SPEAKER_01]: so the cocoa loco does have some stuff so
pretty much I've just been starting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: first two weeks with just water and then
I'll start feeding the floor flex at the
[SPEAKER_01]: chart which is like 2.5 and it's been it's
been going great so got some afisto
[SPEAKER_01]: started they're beasting out so I'm like
oh man what's what are they gonna look
[SPEAKER_00]: like and then so you're feeding all the
way up you know into flower are you
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping feeding like some people will
stop feeding like a week or two before
[SPEAKER_00]: they harvest yeah and then do you like a
flush period do you do any of that or what
[SPEAKER_01]: on the schedule it has it like a flush
period for the last week so it has the
[SPEAKER_01]: newts right up to like the week before
flush which it kind of tapers off and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you start your week of flush and then done
but you know I I've been kind of just like
[SPEAKER_01]: we've grown enough autos like I can tell
their stage and like they're just entering
[SPEAKER_01]: flower they're just doing this so if I
feel like I'm off on the schedule or the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is showing signs of like under food
or too much food then it gives me an
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate idea of like how much I need to
either dial back the floor flex or give
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little more and you know so that's
what that's just what I've been doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: this first run and it seems to be working
great like almost zero issues just water
[SPEAKER_04]: that's kind of not fair I'm sitting here
watching him do so good and I'm like man
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm struggling over here that's why I
think the organics like in learning that
[SPEAKER_01]: way it makes you a better grower because
you have a better under standing of like
[SPEAKER_01]: how to correct that stuff in the soil
where it's like synthetics or what at
[SPEAKER_01]: least the system I'm doing it's like dump
more of this or that you know less more
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so it's not like I'm really learning
anything about I guess how the plants grow
[SPEAKER_01]: or the soil and the microbes and all the
relationships it's totally different style
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing something I guess you think
about when you start growing it is yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's completely different so many
different techniques when you're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about synthetic versus organic for sure I
mean we go on and on about that if we
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanted to but yeah but on the
synthetic side of things a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is a monitor the pH is there a
specific pH range that you typically aim
[SPEAKER_01]: for or you hands off when it comes to pH
for synthetics wise it's been pretty easy
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've all it says on the bag like keep
it between six and seven I think so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty wide range I'm just recalling I'm
not a hundred percent sure but basically
[SPEAKER_01]: my tap pretty much comes out at seven
almost exactly right around there I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been checking it all the time after I
had the floor flex and mix up my gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna feed and every time after I add
that it's it's like right six point three
[SPEAKER_01]: six point two five six point four so I've
literally just been dumping it at what it
[SPEAKER_01]: ends up being and but it's always been
like right in that range and the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to be responding amazing like it's
the stock of the thing is like super duper
[SPEAKER_04]: huge and so do you also do a runoff
measurement for pH or just you only
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor the pH going in I only be it
monitor the pH going in I haven't I
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't had any issues yet to where it's
like oh man maybe I should flush it out to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean the salts or something like I always
like water at least till a little bit runs
[SPEAKER_01]: off every day but not enough to like flood
the bottom of the pan like I pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: got it to where I water and it will drain
off like just enough to wear it because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in airpots has a slightly raised
bottom just enough to where it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: flooding it out and it's sitting in its
own water pool so I've just been watering
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and keeping them like moist and
you know as they get bigger you definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: have to water more I've noticed with
especially with the cocoa because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like the plants so huge just suck in the
pot dry and it's like oh got a coat so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna rig up an automated watering system
here I got some of the rings and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: could just mix up like a big tub of
freaking flora flex for a week and just be
[SPEAKER_01]: like set it yeah it'll be fun well it'll
be easy which is the main so I have more
[SPEAKER_00]: time to edit videos should definitely be
able to save some time there for sure now
[SPEAKER_00]: now heaven on the organic side of things
pH do you monitor pH at all or what do you
[SPEAKER_04]: typically do for pH okay actually this has
been a conversation we've been having
[SPEAKER_04]: we've got to have a conversation so I have
always pHed I've always pHed to 6.5 even
[SPEAKER_04]: before like I was having a pH I was trying
because I always knew that it was
[SPEAKER_04]: important but I didn't really understand
why until I really started understanding
[SPEAKER_04]: you know the plant and how it uptakes
nutrients and a lot of people with
[SPEAKER_04]: organics will say well well don't don't
even worry about pH don't worry about it
[SPEAKER_04]: don't worry about it well so in this last
two two runs I want to say I hadn't been
[SPEAKER_04]: pHing and I've actually had been running
into issues near the end of flower because
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't been pHing my water and I usually
do it you know with a range between 6.3
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know 6.8 and I try to get it
around 6.5 and that's even when I have
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrient or if I even if I'm like molasses
or CalMac I always pH my water and these
[SPEAKER_04]: last few runs I hadn't been and I actually
was running into issues with uptake of
[SPEAKER_04]: nutrients I feel like that's what it is
because all of my plants were showing
[SPEAKER_04]: different signs you know of different
nutrient deficiencies in excess and I was
[SPEAKER_04]: like what is going the only thing for me
that would cause that is a pH imbalance
[SPEAKER_04]: and I just obviously made that deduction
so because all my plants were just so
[SPEAKER_04]: different so I've actually my last run was
starting to do the same thing and I'm like
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I I've admittedly never
checked my soil pH until this week because
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like I've always been told it'll
just balance itself out while I checked my
[SPEAKER_04]: beginning balance for my end balance and
it looks like it creeped up it must have
[SPEAKER_04]: creeped up because I wasn't pHing so for
me I don't know if it's so much of pHing
[SPEAKER_04]: your water but making sure your soil pH is
on so if your soil pH is too high then you
[SPEAKER_04]: should be pHing your water lower so if I
just feel like you should just be checking
[SPEAKER_04]: your soil pH because it's something that I
hadn't been doing and I know but it's it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a real thing then I've had to actually
learn that the hard way I hear a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people saying ignore pH when it comes to
organic as well but really your your water
[SPEAKER_00]: source has to do with it has a lot to do
with it I mean I fell in the same trap
[SPEAKER_00]: ignore pH and when I was growing organic
my water source is at 7.5 pH so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: putting 7.5 pH water going in and my soil
pH drifted up over time and it was a lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrient uptake because that the pH was
so high I know some people had their water
[SPEAKER_00]: sources like overeat pH it's like yeah
mine actually fluctuates throughout the
[SPEAKER_04]: year in the winter it's different from the
summertime in my area so I'm not sure if
[SPEAKER_04]: that's for every area but I feel like at
least checking your pH and making sure
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in a certain range yeah and but your
soil pH is I feel like the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah I've always had best luck you know
adjusting the pH of my water making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you know within the 6.0 6.5 range if
it's on my cocoa I usually go 5.8 and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll water in but there are things in the
soil that's gonna adjust the pH as well
[SPEAKER_00]: right the microbes can adjust the pH the
plant can release acids that can increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the th for example with iron for example
if the pH is so high the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: release acids to lower the pH so then it
will be able to actually intake iron so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there are several different
things in the soil from a scientist
[SPEAKER_00]: actually so there are things beyond just
your your water source of pH that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the actual pH in the medium so how
about PPM or EC our other measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: that growers commonly make do you do it on
the synthetic side of things yeah the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor flex schedule does have like a
recommended EC for each stage too so it
[SPEAKER_01]: gives you not only like how much you
should be weighing and adding to your
[SPEAKER_01]: water per gallon what EC it should come
out to so you know I've been I have an EC
[SPEAKER_01]: meter I have a pH meter of course I'm
checking I still even though it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: been like within that 6 to 6.5 range
easily just just straight mixing it right
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the tap I still been checking the
pH anyways just because I'm still always
[SPEAKER_01]: curious if there's a drift and the EC has
always been pretty much bang on with what
[SPEAKER_01]: they suggest so I've literally just been
you know I feel confident enough now with
[SPEAKER_01]: the auto watering system like I can just
do the recommended amounts with my
[SPEAKER_01]: straight tap water and it should just
basically be maintaining unless I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: the one thing I haven't tested is like
long terms like mix it up let it sit for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week like if I'm gonna mix up a bucket for
a week's worth of watering at a time like
[SPEAKER_01]: is the pH gonna drift over time in that
bucket yeah I'm gonna measure it and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out if it's doing that because then
I'll have to maintain basically a mini I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want a huge reservoir I just want
enough to get me at least like four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five days in case I'm at heaven's house or
we're like going to Chicago for can of
[SPEAKER_01]: fasts like I want to make sure
everything's not gonna die you know water
[SPEAKER_04]: it one day yeah that's like that's a great
experiment I'm actually I'm into that yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: but from what I've seen it seems to
maintain heaven do you do the monitoring
[SPEAKER_04]: of PPM or EC at all when growing organic
never so it's very hands-off I just find
[SPEAKER_04]: that if your pH is on if the plant is
healthy it's gonna it's gonna take what it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs yeah there's a there's definitely
something to less is more especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: autos and you're just learning it's easy
to get in there for it to take it's easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into that too much love syndrome
where you're just trying to do too much at
[SPEAKER_01]: once like with an auto like if you're new
just like take it easy like you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using bag newts from the store and
you're getting some Fox farm like you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just water that baby for like the first
like you're gonna at least get to four or
[SPEAKER_01]: five weeks on just that you know don't go
crazy you know it's easy to get out of
[SPEAKER_01]: control and get in there and start wanting
to add stuff and do this and you know yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree yeah it's definitely
when you have that bag soil that's
[SPEAKER_00]: enriched with with nutrients it can be a
lot easier and then you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely don't have to feed right away
for sure let's let's switch it up let's
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about harvesting autos I know there's
quite a few people that struggle to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify when the plant is ready to
harvest what do you both do when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvesting autos like how do you know
when to harvest well we have a saying 84
[SPEAKER_04]: out the door so I mean that's really our
general timeline we're not gonna say that
[SPEAKER_04]: every plant say 84 days you chop it like
that it's more of it's more of a guideline
[SPEAKER_04]: but we I mean just like any photo yeah
we're looking at the trichomes we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for usually around 15 to 25
percent amber it just kind of depends on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant what we're feeling for how how
the whole plants looking but definitely we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure the trichomes are cloudy
we've found if we chop it when they're too
[SPEAKER_01]: clear just ends up being like you get more
of a jittery effect than what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for so we just find like at least
I like a little bit cloudier with some
[SPEAKER_01]: amber not just on the very top buds but
like throughout the plant yeah but we
[SPEAKER_00]: found most autos I've spoke to somebody
recently talking about autos in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: you brought up something that was very
interesting he had mentioned that with
[SPEAKER_00]: autos in particular he found that some
genetics don't really amber up takes
[SPEAKER_00]: extendedly long time bananas will shoot
out prior have you come across that and
[SPEAKER_00]: any of the autos that you've grown where
it's just it's not turning to amber
[SPEAKER_00]: although the plant looks like it's done
not really I don't think I've seen that
[SPEAKER_04]: either with the genetics that we've grown
I mean we've had the banana and then you
[SPEAKER_04]: like the nanners and stuff but I think
that was more or less you know yeah not
[SPEAKER_04]: even just running it too long I've the the
light situation wasn't great the you know
[SPEAKER_04]: humidity situation wasn't great at the
time when we had experienced this so I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not sure if that had any to do with it or
some feeding issues we could have been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing like stress will cause them to herm
and manner and I've definitely probably
[SPEAKER_01]: stressed some one from a pH issue from a
pen that was way out of whack and that was
[SPEAKER_01]: my own fault for not preventative and like
calibrating it but you know you get autos
[SPEAKER_01]: are susceptible to that kind of stuff
heavy stresses because they are in that
[SPEAKER_01]: race to the finish like they're just
trying to survive and they're just like on
[SPEAKER_04]: a beeline to the end so but as far as the
flower itself I think it's just like you
[SPEAKER_04]: know any photo flower you look at it I
mean if you look at an auto flower versus
[SPEAKER_04]: a photo flower I mean if you're not
looking at the entire plant I don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: if you'd help be able to tell the
difference okay that makes sense I just
[SPEAKER_00]: figured bring that up because I heard like
I said I heard that from somebody else I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was super interesting so I figured
talk to somebody who has probably grown
[SPEAKER_00]: more auto flowers than me I've only grown
probably about two dozen auto flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: total so I don't have that much experience
with with auto flowers but I hadn't heard
[SPEAKER_00]: that before light cycle what light cycle
you typically using for autos some people
[SPEAKER_00]: do in 186 some people do in 24 some people
are doing no darkness 24 hours on and no
[SPEAKER_00]: hours of darkness have you do stick to one
light cycle or you tried several or what
[SPEAKER_04]: well Neil's tried a couple different kinds
of light cycles I've always done 186 it's
[SPEAKER_04]: always just kind of been a no-brainer to
me because I don't autos don't thrive it's
[SPEAKER_04]: been proven they don't thrive in anything
more or I'm sorry less than 18 hours of
[SPEAKER_04]: light but so it was a no-brainer to me to
just do that because obviously electric
[SPEAKER_04]: costs money so yeah so I just started out
with that but Neil's tried different light
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle yeah I pretty much since I started
so when when like the two by four videos
[SPEAKER_01]: started like early on in our channel like
that was basically the grows at my house
[SPEAKER_01]: and I started with the 24 because I was
like oh more light more yields yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and but honestly after like a year of
doing that and just seeing what was coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out of heaven's town running 186 and then
seeing what was coming out of my tent in
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 I felt like there was no there was no
real difference like I didn't see any
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial difference between the yields
from her plants and the yields from mine
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm like well what's four hours more or
you know whatever amount of time rest for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants you know lower electric bill
and you know if I was to tell somebody new
[SPEAKER_01]: like just go 186 because you're gonna be
making mistakes you're not gonna be like
[SPEAKER_01]: so good at growing that you're maxing out
this class genetics and potential where
[SPEAKER_01]: you could actually maybe see that a yield
difference I feel like you know 186 unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really killing it or you're a
really good grower you're probably not
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna notice any if you if you're a really
good grower then you should already know
[SPEAKER_00]: that yeah I gotta agree with you I think
there's 186 generally I've tried both 24 0
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 6 24 light cycles and I didn't see much
of a difference except for my electricity
[SPEAKER_00]: bill which was which was higher with yeah
my personal opinion it wasn't worth it but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's people that are gonna
comment on this video and say what you kid
[SPEAKER_00]: me Tony 24 0
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you know maybe they did like I feel
like some of these people in this deep
[SPEAKER_01]: water culture that can just make these
plants go crazy like yeah you probably
[SPEAKER_01]: would see a better yield because you're
you're nailing it you know but like yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean there's so much more that we could
talk about but we're gonna kind of wrap
[SPEAKER_00]: things up here I did want to get some just
general advice from you two for the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are beginners growing auto flowers
right what general advice do you have for
[SPEAKER_04]: folks that are better just getting started
with autos just know that when you make
[SPEAKER_04]: mistakes just treat it as a learning
experience because when you're growing out
[SPEAKER_04]: of flowers forever but you're on a
timeline so that is always something you
[SPEAKER_04]: have to consider so when you're growing
autos just take every experience as a
[SPEAKER_04]: learning experience and move on and just
know that you you can if you can do it I
[SPEAKER_04]: can do it yeah I'm sorry I'm high if I can
do it you can it's a crazy question but if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're new and you're thinking about
getting into it like you're obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be leaning leaning towards like you
know some certain style of growing because
[SPEAKER_01]: basically you know everybody has their own
way of growing and you won't know until
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow so just start doing something and
figure it out along the way like
[SPEAKER_01]: community's amazing it's super fun it's a
fun hobby and you're pretty much always
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna end up with something you know and
it's always gonna be better every time so
[SPEAKER_00]: just go for the gold good advice so tell
the listeners how can they find you and
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you have upcoming in the future
we're hiking on everything luckily so
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram YouTube here we have the channel
