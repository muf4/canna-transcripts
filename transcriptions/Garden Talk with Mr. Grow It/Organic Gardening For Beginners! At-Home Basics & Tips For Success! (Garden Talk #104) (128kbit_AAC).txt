[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening, and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 104.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Jeremy Silva.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the owner of Build a Soil,
and he's actually been on the podcast once
[SPEAKER_00]: before, episode 51, where he talked all
about building soils and adding organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, we get into a variety of
different organic gardening related
[SPEAKER_00]: topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about seeds parted T's,
cover crops, mulch layers, pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to bring free
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening information of all plants to the
general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boveda is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the Boveda 58% and 62%
humidity packs for 6 years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they do a fantastic job at ensuring my
flowers are at the ideal moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their humidity packs help maintain a
stable environment, protecting against
[SPEAKER_00]: tricone damage, terpene loss, over drying,
and mold.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Jeremy Silva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode we did together,
episode number 51, for those of you who
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't catch that, currently has over
150,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on YouTube alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the podcast platforms,
which has a whole bunch of other listens
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people in the comments
with a lot of positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you remember,
but at the end of the episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told people to comment if they
wanted a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just went crazy in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome back for part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you said 150,000, I was super
impressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, wait a minute, he's got a
big show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if that's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to get into a variety
of organic gardening related topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a quick list of things I want to
get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed Spartatees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH in living soil, which is a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a handful of other things,
which I won't spoil it for the viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if you're on YouTube,
you can always click in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the timestamps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can skip through and see the
different topics as we go along.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd be happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And first off, I love the rundown you just
gave because those are really good topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could see myself using this for our
customers in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Jeremy Silva.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the founder of Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty big year for us being 10
years in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I anticipated that it'd be something
that I would love to do for the rest of my
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wasn't sure if I'd be given the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it's not always easy,
it's my favorite thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started off from the desire to
build living soil from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And living soil is the term that was used
a lot back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that, we started lab testing all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of different things that have
brought me to the current place where I
[SPEAKER_01]: think I can share some pretty valuable
information with all of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of folks tune into your
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys exploded over the past year
and a half on that channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, geez, what are you at?
[SPEAKER_00]: 130, 140,000 subscribers now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to check today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's been going up and faster than I
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dean, who does our editing, he's a wizard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he told me, look, I'm going to have
more than your Instagram here in this
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the 10 years of Instagram posting?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way you're going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he did exactly what he said he was
going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a great relationship where he's
good at editing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talk a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy to get content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really happy to be on YouTube and
really appreciate all the support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of videos and good information on
that channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely have a link to the
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below so people can easily get to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the first topic,
seed-spotted teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you break down, what are the
benefits of doing seed-spotted teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you create them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often should they be done?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to bridge it into two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll mention up front, the first is
about SST and its origin and why we use
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can keep it pretty succinct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second part is, we've moved away
from seed-spotted teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still are very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal was to get the peak enzymatic
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you learn about biology, the breakdown
of organic matter is heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme-dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you hear people that eat
raw.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, you need the enzymes in the
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you cook it, you destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the enzymes are really important to
gut health.
[SPEAKER_01]: In soil health, it's similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Clackamascoot, Jim, which,
by the way, we're going to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: he just sent me like hundreds of his
Pacalolo 1, his famous genetic that he did
[SPEAKER_01]: a back-cross on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm super excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not the Pacalolo, the 1, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grew that one last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as Jim goes, Clackamascoot,
he was a bread baker.
[SPEAKER_01]: He owned a tree nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was part of many different forums where
we provided information to organic
[SPEAKER_01]: growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was just looked up as this legend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people really trusted his advice
because he backed it with facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he started postulating that,
hey, these seeds, they have the energy of
[SPEAKER_01]: life in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use enzymes to sprout, not nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he got some seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sprouted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more to the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But long story short, he blended them up
in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he watered that to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the next day, in the morning,
he opened the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was thinking, wow, why are all
these plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do they have such turgor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are they so happy right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's different?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over many duplications,
you would get that same experience every
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that is interesting
is when you are gardening, it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: pet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know when your pet wags its tail
and is happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the treat you gave it was something of
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ubiquitously across the board,
anybody that uses a sprouted seed tee,
[SPEAKER_01]: they see these benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll tell you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fundamental philosophy behind it
is that when you sprout a seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's this enzymatic process that allows
the creation of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's dormant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd like to unlock those enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before the plant uses them,
we steal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give it to our plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also crosses over where people that
eat vegetarian or not even that,
[SPEAKER_01]: just a healthy lifestyle, a lot of times
we're looking at seeds as a higher source
[SPEAKER_01]: of nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes they'll have sprouted seeds
as the more available nutrition form
[SPEAKER_01]: because that pre-sprouting unlocks some of
the difficult to access nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: allows the gut to digest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably also because of some of the
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And enzymes are weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most research on enzymes is for beer
brewing because that's where enzymes are
[SPEAKER_01]: very important for converting starch and
sugars and making alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a certain process to make the
same duplicatable result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find lots of research on
amylase enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's not as much information out
there on phosphatase and protease and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these other ones that exist in every one
of those seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the beer brewers didn't
require that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in soil, every single seed,
regardless of what you get, will have a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of enzymes that are of benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use really any organic seed to
sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to tap into this benefit, the first
time that Coot shared it with us on the
[SPEAKER_01]: forum, he said, go find good organic seed,
any organic seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cheapest that you could access
tonight if you don't want to go online and
[SPEAKER_01]: buy any seeds would be to go to the
grocery store and buy organic popcorn seed
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have organic popcorn seed in
bulk available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can just sprout them in a
sprouting cup, in a glass jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Google how to sprout them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led to us selling the Easy
Sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my favorite sprouting device.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would use those and fill them full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you blend that in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got a blog article about SST.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can Google build a soil SST recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks down like the measurement of how
many seeds and how much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found none of that really matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need to sprout a generous amount
of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, you know, a quarter cup of seeds can
sprout into a whole bunch of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take that by volume and water
in a bottle, in a blender, you just want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get maybe a quarter full of a blender,
the rest water, blend it, dump that into
[SPEAKER_01]: your bucket of water and feed it to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the simple explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can certainly get weird about the
recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I gave you the blog.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after that, people went crazy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they try a variety of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used our cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got 12 different seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some variety for making an SST.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like the corn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all the seeds that we've tried,
when we get heirloom corn, the water
[SPEAKER_01]: smells sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it imparts a lot more
enzymes than a typical sprouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have science to back that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that the first enzyme that
they found, I think it was something in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ocean, but the first time they were
able to duplicate it naturally,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of like from an animal was in corn
and it's called zeotin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's part of the history there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fast forward, we started learning
these beer brewers, they're not sprouting
[SPEAKER_01]: their seed every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are still malting houses that do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll sprout the seed across the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have an entire process and then they
brew the beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically what happens is that's a
professional job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those seeds, as soon as they're
sprouted, they dry them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually preserves the enzymes and
they're active and available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used to think that's not possible
because these are alive, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: basically releasing the enzyme and then
putting it in stasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is just a malted seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we went on a mission.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, can we buy malted seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, they want to sell it to
you, but they heat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do that because if you roast the
malted seed to a darker color,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get more flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so beer brewers have many varieties of
roasting levels that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went with the lightest one,
the least amount of heat, and that worked
[SPEAKER_01]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fast forward, Kootenai made the gnarly
barley and that is sprouted barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: sprouted lentils and sprouted organic
non-gmo corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're taking these ancient
grains like corn and the lentils and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're adding the barley, which is heavily
available, a lot of enzyme research,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've already been sprouted and dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now what I do is I take that,
grind it up fresh in a blender and just
[SPEAKER_01]: sprinkle it on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes out the step where I have to
plan a day ahead to sprout the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to sprout the seed,
it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of us still do that, but what we
learned was sprouting seed at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're trying to do this, you want the
tail, the little white part of the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: that comes out originally to be as short
as possible, about to just explode out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed or barely have left.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get a long tail like that,
much of the enzymes have already started
[SPEAKER_01]: to be utilized by that growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are going to sprout some
seeds, you want to arrest them as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that sprouting and blend them up
and use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could even dry them out for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will put them on low in the
oven, you know, like just to dehydrate
[SPEAKER_01]: them and they'll make their own malted
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what we can tell, there's pretty good
science at these sprouting labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they are able to unlock a little
bit better more consistent percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes than sprouting your own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly they both, I mean,
they both produce the same reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the whole story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder maybe if you have any questions
or anything I left out that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know about that, that second part
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people were still sprouting their
own seeds, but having that option,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other way to get the enzymes is pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty interesting that you even
use this 12 seed blend, the cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crop makes a lot of sense for use
because it's diverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we first learned about
spreaded seed teas, we learned that
[SPEAKER_01]: basically every seed would work and nature
does like diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thought is, well, cover crop is
usually on farm soil and sometimes those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds germinate and die and it's a natural
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a living seed meal at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if your cover crop doesn't grow and
you let it sprout and then you just till
[SPEAKER_01]: it in immediately, it's a seed meal that
normally you pay money for like soybean
[SPEAKER_01]: meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are better seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've made them alive in the soil and
then killed them and they're fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if the enzymes aren't perfect,
your sprouted seed tea is going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into cover crops, then there
are so many different things that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in your 12 seed blend, you have
flax, clover, lentils, vetch, whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of good things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about cover crops, you know,
the benefits, when they should be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some debate on whether you
should grow cover crops along with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or if it should just be in between
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a deep one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I encourage people to do their own
research because there's lots of great
[SPEAKER_01]: information and some of these organic
trials that are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have methods for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've tested organic growing trials,
no till trials, and many of the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: producing regenerative farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mission is spread where these cover
crop companies pop up because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working so well, they can then sell
seed to other farmers and they start to
[SPEAKER_01]: receive the benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on farming, it's pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have bare soil, that's not how
nature intends it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the conventional farming style.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to organic farming,
one of the benefits of a cover crop when
[SPEAKER_01]: you first start doing research is there's
multiples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the basic sense is that cover crops
are beneficial plants that have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to improve the soil quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do that through a number of different
actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is they grow vigorously and they cover
all of the soil and they attract
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on top of that, the thing I think
they're most famous for is that clover
[SPEAKER_01]: legumes, clover is in the legume family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually take nitrogen out of the air
and they have the ability to fix that
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen through its nodules on the root
and a organic process and put it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does it through two methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the cover crop can grow in soil
that your normal crop may not be as good
[SPEAKER_01]: at growing in because the soil may be not
improved yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crop will grow in there and it'll
add organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you till that cover crop in,
it becomes what they call green manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are fertilizing the soil by putting
freshly green grown plant that's full of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon and it used the sun and it grew
some of the nutrients from the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: you kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what happens is you turn these
minerals that were down deep, it's pulled
[SPEAKER_01]: up to the top and it's turned in
organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now your next crop can benefit from all
that fertility and also the soil structure
[SPEAKER_01]: full of organic matter will hold water,
it'll hold beneficial life, it'll hold
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, worms, all of these things
happen by utilizing cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a dry climate like Colorado,
cover crop fields, when done right,
[SPEAKER_01]: there'll be like a microclimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be moist underneath the cover crop,
the morning dew's on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, when you think about how
nature works, it makes a ton of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what isn't as natural is when people
first started using cover crop indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of it took off because
it's kind of romantic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this emotional feeling to see all
these plants like a jungle growing around
[SPEAKER_01]: your main cash crop because it feels like
you're actually farming or gardening in a
[SPEAKER_01]: real way instead of just bare soil with a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you consider that, it makes a lot
of sense, but we were told for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time, whether it's in your raised bed
vegetable garden or whether it's indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: that adding all these plants would be a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one, they would say it's gonna steal
all the nutrients from your main plant or
[SPEAKER_01]: it's gonna attract pests or problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've found most of these gardens and
gardening worries are inexperienced
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners having many problems and
correlation does not always equal
[SPEAKER_01]: causation.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times when you know a whole
system, you're able to utilize the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and indoor some of the best crops
I've ever grown were when I started using
[SPEAKER_01]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what I relate that to,
besides the fixing nitrogen, all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things, which fixing nitrogen takes a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may not be as big of benefit indoors,
but when the plant dies, it returns
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen to the soil that way,
even if it wasn't fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can happen, it does happen,
especially when you're growing no-till and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have cover crop growing forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the benefit that I think I experienced
is some of our earlier soil recipes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they weren't as balanced because we didn't
do as much soil testing and we would just
[SPEAKER_01]: throw in according to the recipes we read
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them were heavy on extra
inputs because more is better,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we learned that some of those excesses
were actually problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the amendments like kelp,
if you doubled or tripled just because you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to, they brought maybe some sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you added too much certain
ingredients, maybe there's chloride or
[SPEAKER_01]: bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, all these recipes
work, but if they get junked up and too
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the bad ones, it takes a while for
the soil to leach it out and deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put cover crop in,
all of a sudden, you don't have to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect at watering because if you
overwater, the cover crop drinks it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you underwater, you're going to know
because you're going to get wilt in both
[SPEAKER_01]: the cover crop as well as the main crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more about the overwatering,
it helps fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also seems to digest some of the
problems in the soil and then release them
[SPEAKER_01]: through the cover crop, which is no longer
like too salty or too problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would like buffer a soil that wasn't
perfect and I'd get really healthy growth
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for when you're living soil,
I mean, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a perfect leaf, not burnt tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to put in the natural method
to get the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for what it's worth, the cover
cropping made a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the argument that you touched on,
should we grow them with the plant or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's about technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you are, let's say you're
growing a big tomato plant and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they take lots of energy and they grow
really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you grow cover crop and you grow
at 12 inches tall, and then you come
[SPEAKER_01]: spread it and you put a little tomato
seed, good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cover crop will absolutely devour it,
take it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't even have a chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically on a farm, that's not how it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would till that cover crop in,
they would cover it with plastic or they
[SPEAKER_01]: would at least cover it for a week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would all turn into fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'd go plant their crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, what we see most often is
what's called living mulch or more
[SPEAKER_01]: companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to be cover crop,
but cover crops seem to be affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of the benefits we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also grow herbs and you can grow
some quick growing food crops as companion
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I encourage you to do is let's
say that same tomato plant scenario,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you plant the tomato plant first,
or if you have a transplant, and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: put the cover crop in, the cover crop
becomes secondary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes shaded by the bigger leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never really gets to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more now in a support role where
it's barely trying to stay alive
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath everything you have going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me is the living mulch technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you get the benefit of the
moisture management, the beneficial,
[SPEAKER_01]: the predators get to live underneath
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you chop it and drop it,
and you might add some other fertilizers
[SPEAKER_01]: at some point, organic ones, they combine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the build-a-soil way is to use a high
carbon mulch, like a straw mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the browns that are the straw and the
greens that are the cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're chopped and combined
together, that's the foundation of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: make compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The browns and greens decompose into
black, rich compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we like worms in there and all
the beneficials, it provides a home where
[SPEAKER_01]: normally that bare soil would be beat by
the sun, dry, and of no beneficial use to
[SPEAKER_01]: all these organisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, we could talk for days
about just this, but in that quick
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation, I wanted to try and really
give you as many directional signs to
[SPEAKER_01]: start to research as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the white Dutch clover for
several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did just the way that you had
mentioned, which is you grow the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop and actually adding in that mulch
along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been beneficial for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things I learned,
actually a couple of people in my podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: tell me that thrips feed off of clover,
which I thought was kind of interesting to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing that I have ever come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of that happening before
now?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more the fear, I think,
that comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrips feed on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go in a grow and you're planting
fresh seed, you shouldn't have thrip in
[SPEAKER_01]: the seed and it shouldn't be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's thrip there, it's a
blessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's on the clover.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not on your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also be an early identifier if you
see something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thripper is some of the easiest to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a concern for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Commercially, it can be more of a problem
because they can't use spinosad and some
[SPEAKER_01]: other ingredients, which does make it
slightly harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I tend to avoid a lot of those things
and go for first world experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people use cover crops
successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some interesting cover crops
that you can try and use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those are for management purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a big commercial facility started
using our 12 seed cover crop and they
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't tend to the mashing it down or
chopping and dropping, or if there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: pocket that got really out of control,
the vetch can start to vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I like that, some people may
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might choose something like the
white dutch that has no management.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays small.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never gets overgrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it grows fairly slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can tolerate some really cold
temperatures, which is great for outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: use for like a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But indoors, I like the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the blanket that the white white
dutch makes, but I'd love having the peas
[SPEAKER_01]: and the flowers from the vetch and the
lentils and all the different things
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I researched permaculture,
they often indicate that getting up to
[SPEAKER_01]: about 12 different species of seeds gives
you the diversity that's required to have
[SPEAKER_01]: as much success and an open field from
season to season where different seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: different things can happen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor, maybe not as important,
but I like that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things to consider, let's say you
have cover crop going.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this that we learned,
I think that if I can point a direction
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be philosophical for a lot of
your viewers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really changed my life, helped me start
build the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people reference this book as one
of the reasons why they decided to go
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the One Straw Revolution by Masanobo
Fukuoka.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a story about somebody who worked
in the, long story short, in the chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: field his whole life, chemistry,
and then decided to go back to nature on
[SPEAKER_01]: his property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically did nothing to it and observed
and would see how nature works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when growing his crops,
instead of growing rice, the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: way, flooded in water and transplanted by
hand, they would throw the rice in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grain that was growing previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get some of the exact crops
off, but they would spread it while the
[SPEAKER_01]: crop was still growing and it would
germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they go harvest the next crop and
that would grow up through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you started to see some of the
benefits of these natural cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it teaches a lot about the no-till way
and the philosophy behind it in that book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's amazing, but he would teach
people in there, you put all the crops
[SPEAKER_01]: that you, you chop down on the ground and
then he would go to the neighboring farms
[SPEAKER_01]: and they would have them all the,
like the stocks lined up perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, throw it like a child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like nature doesn't line it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to block all of the water and
the light and the bugs and it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: just be thrown out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that philosophy, he would say,
return all of what you took to the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: other than the harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of indoor growers,
they do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take all of the leaf from the plant,
all of the cover crop that they chop and
[SPEAKER_01]: they throw it all in the mulch layer on
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while that's great, if you don't tend
to the environmental rules and there's not
[SPEAKER_01]: enough airflow, you can create a lot of
humidity, tons of decay, and you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: to get some of these bulb mites and you
can get a lot of beneficials, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: start composting right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not judicious with,
you know, keeping it somewhat knocked down
[SPEAKER_01]: and airflow there, they'll start to climb
up your main plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be a problem because
beneficial or not, you don't want them on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing to learn is that
whether it's good or bad, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, there is some balance that's
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to chop and drop,
just know that you should have some decent
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow underneath there so that you don't
build up this massive amount of decaying
[SPEAKER_01]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know on your website, you sell the
barley straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually purchased some of that a while
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it in all my grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people use wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you don't have those on your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe talk about the reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, can you get into the Bloat
oyster mushroom straw log, the living
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch that you have on your site?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll talk about all of them because
whether you buy it from Build A Soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're some part of the world
where you can't access Build A Soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to be able to tap into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea with straw is a few fold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be carrying like an organic wheat
straw that we use in the Bloat oyster
[SPEAKER_01]: straw logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're shifting away from the barley
mainly because any mulch works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want you to have to go look for
something specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you where the barley comes
from in case you're wondering why we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to be so specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be that if you had a pond on
your farm or on your property,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you wanted to eliminate algae,
you would float a raft.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way you do it is take some logs
and you would tie a bale of barley straw
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, and you just float it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the breakdown would cause an enzyme
release that would kill all of the algae
[SPEAKER_01]: and make the pond healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we thought, wow, if we're going to
really risk chopping up straw in our grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe one that adds some benefit would be
of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you just go down the street or
Craigslist and buy a weed-free straw,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's typically Roundup Spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's nice in the weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really just want something that's
like seeds are fine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more cover crop, especially in a
container grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always just pull the seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you mulch thick and some seeds start to
sprout, you can just take the whole layer
[SPEAKER_01]: of mulch and flip it, and now they're
extinguished.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least, you know, on an outdoor farm,
you can just use your pitchfork and flip
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mulch, so the straw mulch,
the idea was is that we're covering the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, keeping it moist underneath it,
blocking the light, allowing the worms to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up to it and pull whatever top
dressing down and be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The straw that we sell is more affordable,
but it can be dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of my preferences for somebody
that's doing it by hand is to put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket and pre-moist it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you place it, it's really clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to do without making a huge
mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But oftentimes, those are big chunks,
and I would like chop it up around the
[SPEAKER_01]: edges of my container to make it fit in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the blue oyster straw log,
that's already all done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get in deeper because it'll take a
second to explain so people can follow me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me just go through the wood mulch
first, and then I'll revisit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wood mulch, we used to carry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a local compost yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to work with him when I first
started to build the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had a screening machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would take his compost that took a
year or two to make, and he would screen
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of the reject wood chips that
would kick out because they're slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: too large for the screen, they were full
of mycelium, and they were beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we would actually sell that as our
composted wooden bark mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: People loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even when I used it, I would notice
that that much woody carbon, it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to break down into soil nutrients as
fast for a living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it attracted a lot of the rolly
pollies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those little guys, although they seem
great and they are a benefit, if you get
[SPEAKER_01]: bark mulch and you get a proliferation of
them, which they often come in the bark,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have a million of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then literally once they run out of
stuff to do or overpopulate, they will
[SPEAKER_01]: start climbing your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will start stripping the stalks,
eating leaves, eating seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I talk about with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two sides to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes when you hear something
from fear, like, oh, thripper on clover,
[SPEAKER_01]: you only get the one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nature is never that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a great benefit to the wood
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm trying to tell you the other side
that these beneficial insects that are of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit, if a population outpaces any
predator, I mean, it's almost like you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to put some little birds in there to
eat them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it gets bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm happy to report it's pretty rare
that you get an overtaking of the rolly
[SPEAKER_01]: pollies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's part of the reason why I don't
recommend wood a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason is people ask a lot of
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they used to be like, well,
is this wood allelopathic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does it have chemicals that kill the
other tree that grows near it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that ruin my soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't use cedar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if I... Basically, from what I've
learned, anything works as mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you start mixing it in the soil,
now you should be asking questions about
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of bark it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that helps, or what type of
wood chip it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood chips are used for a different
purpose than we use them for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look up regenerative farming,
a lot of times you'll have conversations
[SPEAKER_01]: about wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best, I believe, are the renal
wood chips, which are very young trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they're cleared out, you have
very fresh, more easily absorbable carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not so lignin, that's not so hard
to decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you put it through a chipper,
and you don't have to take the whole tree,
[SPEAKER_01]: just some branches, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not killing a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they would spread that on the
property, on soil that they were planning
[SPEAKER_01]: on using in a year or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would enrich the life and the
fungus and add organic matter and really
[SPEAKER_01]: improve the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during that first year, you can't
really grow in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wood is so high carbon, all the
microorganisms eat first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take all the nitrogen out,
the plants can't really grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another place you hear this is the
hugelkultur beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've not heard of it, Google
H-U-G-E-L, hugelkultur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a method of digging a whole
bearing old rotting wood and then building
[SPEAKER_01]: a mound on top and growing that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the first year, that wood does tend to
rob some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when stuff's on top, it doesn't really
rob nutrients, whether it's straw or
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't worry about that when you're
looking into mulching, as long as it's on
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like a skin layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just protects the organism of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that was a lot, but I really want to
talk about the blue oyster straw log
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a pretty simple connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The straw that we would use, it's great,
but you'd have some weed seeds growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just pluck them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also it was a little dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had a local mushroom farm that
said, hey, I've got straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you could use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wanted us to talk about making
compost from all their waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not going to drive down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't conducive to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, making the compost for them or
them doing it for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we decided to sell, when they're done
growing blue oyster mushrooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could get another fruiting out of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But economically, once you've done one or
two cycles, you don't get as much result
[SPEAKER_01]: on the third, fourth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they would just discard these bags that
had straw in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefit there was the straw had
already been sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had already been heated in water and
made to receive the mushroom mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put these grain in there that
have all of the blue oyster mushrooms they
[SPEAKER_01]: were growing for natural grocers,
all organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was inside there and they'd already
grown the mushrooms and we would just buy
[SPEAKER_01]: them used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a customer would cut it open,
put it on their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes another mushroom would grow
and it was all moist and it was already
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you felt like you're not introducing
any pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a couple of things would happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, they would turn green from
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's of benefit, but it would scare some
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second thing that really put
the icing on the cake is they went out of
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't get it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, ManPurse Medicinals, aka Kevin,
he works here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a mycologist and went to school for
science, worked in a white lab coat in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lab for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he has a whole background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since his passion was mycology,
has a flow hood, the whole deal,
[SPEAKER_01]: he ran with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he immediately started making blue
oyster straw logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of growing mushrooms first,
we offer them to you just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom farm would grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are ready to fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow mushrooms and eat all of them
and harvest pounds off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then convert that to mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you don't want to grow the
mushrooms, the cost is so good,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just cut it and put it as mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the main thing here is now it's wet,
now it's sterilized, and now it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: clean mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's slightly chopped up smaller to make
sure the mushrooms grow on it properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you use it, you get this like
mushroom rich odor when you spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's one of the caveat, one of the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we look at what it's made out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the earth is cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the most abundant materials
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think cellulose is plant material,
you know, organic cell structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the next one that's most ubiquitous is
chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chitin we know activates some plant
defenses because chitin is what insects
[SPEAKER_01]: are made of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out mushrooms are made of
chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we get this blue oyster straw log
that's inoculated with all this fungus and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all white and fully grown and you
spread it out, you're inoculating your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil with chitin rich material,
which will allow those building blocks to
[SPEAKER_01]: occur to build the fungus that you'd like,
as well as maybe activating some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: SAR or response from the plant that we're
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't want to say it does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say if there's even a
hypothetical benefit, it's worth research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the chitin is an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spelled C-H-I-T-I-N.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we used to call it chitin because we
never heard somebody say it out loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you got to be chitin me,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, it turns out chitin, not chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to pick up one of those
mushroom straw logs and try that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of those that's great because
Kevin gets to add the value.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use them for mushrooms,
get more than their money's worth out of
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms before they use it as mulch if
they have the discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fairly hard to reproduce on your
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to like sterilize, boil water,
get the grain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he really is adding a lot of value by
making it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a true win-win,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have another mulch question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it kind of relates to mulch,
not necessarily is mulch, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: folks in order to retain water and stuff
and you guys deal with the earth boxes is
[SPEAKER_00]: just simply cover the top of the soil and
use a piece of plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that or some people using cardboard as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cutting up pieces and then putting
it there, but it's not actually like
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down like a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's why, you know, we really
want to consider it a true mulch,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not really breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on like putting
cardboard on top?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did it in one of our last YouTube
series not to live as the mulch,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when I left town, I actually covered
the recently decomposed cover crop with
[SPEAKER_01]: the cardboard to keep the light off of it
and let the organisms work it into soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I pulled the cardboard off,
the cover crop was gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a couple little patches,
but you'd work your hands in and it was no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer six inches of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that cover is one of the benefits
of mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using a carbon-rich mulch or a
green manure mulch where you're chopping
[SPEAKER_01]: the greens and mulching with it,
those all have multiple benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with multiple benefits comes some
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, it's adding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's decomposing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a simple cover removes all of the
thought of how long does it take to
[SPEAKER_01]: decompose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is this good for my soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it simply covers it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cover is good because the soil doesn't
need to be hit by the UV of the sun and
[SPEAKER_01]: your lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the worms can come right up to
the soil surface and there's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: population of beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can peel the plastic back and see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I originally didn't like the idea of
the plastic because it's not as romantic
[SPEAKER_01]: as I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as like, does it tug on your
heart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heartstrings that nature is not always
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us think nature and just to have
all these views, but it's like nature can
[SPEAKER_01]: be pretty hardcore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a lot of like besides
poison ivy and animals killing each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not always all perfect,
but when we're looking at covering it
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the natural process, at least you
get that cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to organic farming,
they use plastic a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they get a really thick piece that
they can reuse over and over so they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not being wasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to commercial farming,
like if you picture a hundred foot row,
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet wide, full of lettuce,
or they're about to seed it and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: to use machines to seed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all evenly done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just cover crop and then run the
seed machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they would do is they would cover
crop and as soon as it got a few inches
[SPEAKER_01]: tall, they would use a machine to kind of
just lightly till it under or whip it
[SPEAKER_01]: under the first layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's buried by the soil and then
come pull that heavy black plastic over
[SPEAKER_01]: and put rocks on it, wait a couple of
weeks, pull it all back off and have
[SPEAKER_01]: unbelievable carbon rich black beautiful
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been freshly inoculated with all
that mulch and then they plant into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using a cover is understanding how to
use a tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the earth box, the reason why we
recommend that cover is we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: our customers that use straw and cover
crop in the earth box and it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the earth box is only about a cubic
foot of soil, maybe a cubic foot and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half plus the water holding area.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow a big plant out of that,
it can start to run out of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have a regular mulch layer,
you can only water through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the plastic, you can mound,
picture this is the container,
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth box wall and your plant is in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mound three, four, five,
six inches above the top with compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why this works is you don't
have to water on the top where the water
[SPEAKER_01]: spills out the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: You water down below in the earth box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you cover that big mulch layer
that's packed as a mound with the plastic,
[SPEAKER_01]: the feeder roots can go all the way up in
it and digest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the earth box, normally that much
mulch material might be a little rich,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the earth box has clean water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the roots can always access water
without nutrients to balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to work really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like it's appearance as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really do like fresh straw with the
green cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is something like art.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I've been using the cardboard to
cover on some of my recent grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have somebody comment on one of my
videos mentioning that there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: concern that chemicals that are on the
actual cardboard could get released into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil and those chemicals don't break
down very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing with the plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that actually a concern or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's not a concern,
but I want to get there because their
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts are totally in the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should be concerned because most
of the industrial stuff is going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some problems with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would encourage you to think of it
as a lot of these compounds, the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people are worried about some of
the chemicals and plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I mean, farmers use PVC all day
long to irrigate and none of that actual
[SPEAKER_01]: material grows into the plant,
but we don't want to hurt the soil either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to be mindful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you go narrow focused on
something, you can kind of get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: too deep without missing the rest of the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composting by nature cleans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It removes pathogens and chemicals and it
improves so that if I was really going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be forced to use something that was
contaminated, composting it and then
[SPEAKER_01]: working it through worms would give me the
most relief that at least we tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: remediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're talking cardboard,
that's mostly carbon, oftentimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: either newspaper to a worm bin or
cardboard to a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now as a cover, it's different,
but in a worm bin, people shred cardboard,
[SPEAKER_01]: shred newspaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feed it to their worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms don't die.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thought is the ink on the
newspaper is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, it's chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's soy based ink and it's not
really a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge I have is I don't try and
put round up sprayed soy that's industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: and in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would try to avoid it, but the
smarter side of me knows that it's small
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts and the microorganisms and the
worms just rip that to shreds as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean is if a chemical is in
there, composting biology, worms and the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes, they can actually take a chemical
structure and break it apart so that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: no longer that dangerous chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the carbon hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the individual component that
made something like that, its structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't say that you can take
something like a radioactive waste and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be clean just because you have some
worms in there, but my suspicion is a
[SPEAKER_01]: small amount of cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the worms going in the
grooves and mating and the enzymes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are being produced, I find it very,
very, very unlikely that you'd have any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of health problem from doing that,
whether it's soil or your own health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not a doctor, but I really
think that you'd be fine with some
[SPEAKER_01]: cardboard on top of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also understand what they're saying,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these, maybe the glue has got
something in it that's a little bit weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are my thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on to a viewer
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one was actually left in the
comment section on the last episode we did
[SPEAKER_00]: together and it relates to pH in living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this viewer says their tap water comes
in at 8.9 pH and after filtering,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still 8.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they lower the pH of the water
prior to doing a soil drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what should they use to lower the
pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH in living soil has always been a big
argument point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you a little spiel on soil
pH before we get into what this person
[SPEAKER_01]: should do about their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no one simple answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of relate it to jiu-jitsu because I
grapple regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you get an answer from a white or
blue belt, it might be an answer that
[SPEAKER_01]: would work, but you don't know if it works
up to the highest level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start to find when you ask a black
belt, hey, how do I get out of this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he just looks at you and says,
don't get in that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of frustrating,
but typically the smarter people I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have just a straight answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're talking about pH,
it really does depend.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're on a farm and you're growing
out here in Colorado, our soil is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's not full of alkalinity and
problematic substances, it's just full of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really want to lower the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is the soil is
made up of these elements that dictate the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same in our potting soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we make a potting soil and we're
adding copious amounts of rock dust,
[SPEAKER_01]: clays and compost, we're attempting to
mimic a regular high organic matter soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why we call it living soil,
not potting soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potting soil is basically hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a medium to hold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we get to the point where we're
designing it and we send it to the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see this percentage of calcium,
magnesium, potassium, all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually what's creates your soil
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you take some water and you put
a half gallon in there and it doesn't just
[SPEAKER_01]: pour out the bottom, like you're not
leaching the soil, you're just watering
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the water isn't going to change the pH
of the soil unless you strip out the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium or add more magnesium or dump
sodium in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what dictates the pH of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of growers, they start reading,
they're like, wow, plants can't take up
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients if the pH is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That must be what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they also can't if you're
overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it's something else that's
causing the issue, not really the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you, let's say you took perfectly
clean water and it was 7.0 pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just RO, there's zero parts per
million in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And someone tells you 5.5 pH is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally you're putting a little
bit of, you're just adjusting the hydrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: ever so slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no sodium in there, there's no
calcium, there's nothing that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil will probably change the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting is the soil pH is
what dictates the uptake of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the root in a living soil grow can
change the pH in that two to three
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeters zone right around the root tip
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: On an exponential scale, moving a point or
two is like logarithmic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like much greater than it sounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who are we fooling if we're trying to
predict the perfect pH where the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: might be saying, no, I'm trying to force
the soil to be in this range and you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and changing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being a steward means trusting the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't trust some soil that's full
of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm saying a well-built soil, the pH
should totally handle itself and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: should not have any concern of pH at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the curve ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're farming out here on this
alkaline soil and you water with ditch
[SPEAKER_01]: water that is runoff from all the other
farms by the time it gets to you and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: high in alkalinity, not just pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know they sound the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can do more research on water and
I'm certainly not an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know enough to be dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: That alkalinity is actually the problem,
not the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that it's bicarbonate that's in there
and chlorides that's in there and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: some magnesium sodium that's just jacking
the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you go water with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not like the high pH water is the
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fact that we already fairly
alkaline and the biology and your cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop finally released some calcium from
the calcium carbonate and the plant root
[SPEAKER_01]: is about to access readily available
calcium and the water that comes in is
[SPEAKER_01]: full of carbonate and binds up in a
calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant can't get it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the biology is trying to do all
this work and our water stops it and binds
[SPEAKER_01]: and makes other chemicals and is
constantly causing issues, pH is a
[SPEAKER_01]: concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is that acidifying
an alkaline soil actually eliminates those
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonates that are the problem,
not really the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now the calcium stays available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I find it fascinating that there's
so much to learn about water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say none of it matters when
you're on regular water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you have well water,
ditch water, things that may have stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: it that really messes with your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can build up over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be very worthwhile to go to Logan
Labs out of Ohio, go to LoganLabs.com and
[SPEAKER_01]: go to their water analysis, print out a
report, call them whatever you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put the water in a bottle,
you mail it to them and they give you an
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis and they'll tell you,
here's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you don't know about a water
test, you can just take the recommended
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers and compare and see where you're
high or low and then make some guesses and
[SPEAKER_01]: then maybe do some research.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting about the person
that you're saying asked the question is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly rare to see such high pH out
of the tap because most municipalities
[SPEAKER_01]: have rules for what will ruin the pipes
and what's good for humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder if that tap is connected
to a well, and that's why it's really well
[SPEAKER_01]: water, but it's his tap water,
in which case he'd have to do a water test
[SPEAKER_01]: because if that's just some minerals that
are non-problematic, it could be that he
[SPEAKER_01]: just waters with it and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be that the living soil growers
would use AgCel 16H, like every watering,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it's not organic, but it's
made from sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of us really cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's like 11 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you check your water after adding
it, it's like nine and people would water
[SPEAKER_01]: every time and they'd be like,
this pH doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think partially the mulch layer and
a volume of soil, it can definitely fix a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a smaller container with nine pH,
if it's full of a problem, it'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: realized fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big bed of soil might buffer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reverse osmosis that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people say, don't use RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree because it's wasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes part of the water and discards it
and it's slow and it's fairly expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it does fix the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in living soil, it'll work just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: RO is not gonna hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just more like maybe not the best way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without a soil test, you could just RO it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's sodium in there, you're not
gonna filter it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to RO it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sodium is gone and your
plants are gonna grow like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the meantime, if you're really worried,
you can just go buy some water and use
[SPEAKER_01]: that until you get your water tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a pain to lug water around,
but at least you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this was just tap water and it was
eight pH or something, I would just use it
[SPEAKER_01]: and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could always buy water, use it on some
plants and use your tap water on one and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of decide going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the gist of this is it
depends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no one right answer for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I will say pH should not matter,
but when you have water that you know is
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic, it returns to the equation
and it's important to have good water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend checking the soil pH with
like either the one of those blue lab
[SPEAKER_00]: probes that go right into the medium or
doing a runoff pH test when growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it depends, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know nothing and you don't know
where the soil is from, then you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out a baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe getting a lot of measurements on it
would be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for instance, I might have a high pH
just from having lots of calcium in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and the soil not really being used in wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probe it and you're freshly potting up
and it reads a little high and you start
[SPEAKER_01]: tinkering with adjusting the pH and you
mess something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where a lot of times, you know,
you send it to the lab and it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: slightly high pH, but you know,
a lot of our crops like a higher pH above
[SPEAKER_01]: neutral and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we shouldn't freak out living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, the root tip and
everything has a way to buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that enables us to take advantage
of the buffering qualities of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in hydro, if you're not exactly in
the pH, the nutrient won't go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in soil, we have a lot of buffer room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that does change
things a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about EC or some people do PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you monitor that or recommend people
monitor that when they're growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some outdoor growers, some growers
do when they're making a lot of teas and
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't, I'm not going to say that
you're trying to target some PPM,
[SPEAKER_01]: some EC level, but it gives you some
indication.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you are a grower and you just fly
to someone else's farm for the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've used these tools, you could go,
oh, the water's pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a lot in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tells me what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might be able to get up to speed
faster, but probing the soil pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, may not really tell you as
much in the sense that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: would test the runoff and I'm like,
well, the runoff may have nothing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with what the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd recommend a slurry test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know those pH meters work,
but I kind of lost track when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking the last time, but when it comes
to the pH, if you send your soil to a lab
[SPEAKER_01]: and they tell you why, sometimes there's
just a little bit too much magnesium in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and it jacks your pH, but it can be
dealt with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just getting the pH reading on its
own, although it might be valuable,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't really tell you how to fix
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you're just going, well,
do I pH down my water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not if it's sodium in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's causing the high pH and sodium and
magnesium can just jack your pH really
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we typically recommend is if
you're seeing a high pH in a soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've tested it, and now you're convinced
that there's a problem, you can use a
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoon of gypsum and a four or five
gallon bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can leach that through the soil to
there's good amount of runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sulfur that's in the gypsum will
rip the excesses out of the soil and flush
[SPEAKER_01]: them out and replace them with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a high pH soil that's high calcium
crushes a high pH soil that's got
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium and sodium and potassium,
it's just terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not always the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I recommend sending it to a
lab so we can see what built that pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the EC and the PPM meters,
I know some people that they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, this recipe I make with the compost
tea, it works so well every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get a reading and maybe next time
they do it, they'll see if the reading is
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll start to share that as kind of
a baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right away you can see some crazy
readings and some of these organic
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions, and it doesn't really mean that
it's plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in my daily life, I don't use a pH
EC any of that pretty much ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I've been pretty hands off ever
since I've been using organic inputs is I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't really needed to check the PPM or
the pH at all really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's people that test the pH of
their saliva and of their urine and they
[SPEAKER_01]: try and eat foods that are more alkaline
causing to put themselves in a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say 99% of those stop doing after a
few days and just eat healthy and decide
[SPEAKER_01]: this whole thing is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is good food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I need to control all of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's when we're looking for a
shortcut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there one food that'll fix all of the
problems that I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alkaline food or healthy foods,
just throw the chart away and eat healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to another topic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get your thoughts on sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are adding in molasses,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use honey or brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your overall opinion on adding
sugars in throughout the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is one I'm not an expert on
and I have my opinion and I'll share it
[SPEAKER_01]: with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's based on, you know, the last 10
years of build a soil and previous to
[SPEAKER_01]: that, just growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of it was hydroponics
grow stores selling sweeteners that made
[SPEAKER_01]: sense because you're like, I want oozing
sweet resin and I want flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The human mind is like, oh yeah,
that'd be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'd hear of people adding
Kool-Aid to their water to get more grape
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just like, there's just so
much out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it comes from the best
intention as far as our thought process,
[SPEAKER_01]: like even flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get flushing the medium, but you're not
going to go pull a non-mobile nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in an elemental form that it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's plant and pull it out like a straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's lots of considerations
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just I have a hard time thinking
that certain sugars are going to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me bring it all back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glucose, fructose, sucrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these different percentages
and different ingredients that you might
[SPEAKER_01]: add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coconut water is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a good number of all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason why we use the coconut is
not because of the sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it may be one of the big benefits,
but it's because we've researched the
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut and its human health impact and
all the enzymes that are in this big seed
[SPEAKER_01]: or droop and the liquid that's in there
has not yet formed the coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the elixir of life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens to be full of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sugars, because biology, sugars,
they need, I mean, sugars like the energy
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at the plant and it's
producing what we call root exudates and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's feeding the soil, it's basically
feeding liquid carbon, which is a sugar to
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we just start dumping sugars in,
we may be stimulating biological responses
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant wasn't looking for when
it's supposed to be in control of its
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar production to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I typically see people using sugars
more in a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of the compost tea
originally, so you all know, was that we
[SPEAKER_01]: were not making a nutrient tea at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were trying to take microorganisms,
shake them off of the compost by bubbling
[SPEAKER_01]: them, have enough air in there to
stimulate them to be alive and happy and
[SPEAKER_01]: give them a food source that they could
devour.
[SPEAKER_01]: In doing so, you'd multiply billions of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you did the timing just right,
you've got the most diversity before all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those strong ones ate the weak ones and
you'd pour that on your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the goal with the sugar being used in
the compost tea was to fully finish the
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar before you applied it to the soil,
meaning the microorganisms devoured it,
[SPEAKER_01]: not the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sticking to that, a lot of us
weren't looking to just go dump molasses
[SPEAKER_01]: on the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more just a compost tea thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And molasses has been used for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got other trace minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got some other benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that came out was a
lot of the compost tea brewers from the
[SPEAKER_01]: Elaine Ingham crowd would say,
you can't add molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to feed the wrong
microorganisms and then you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hurt your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen that happen, but I
definitely agree and understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: certain food inputs might stimulate
certain populations of microbes versus
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my mind, plants produce sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't think they can be bad and
just throw the baby out with the bath
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I use a little coconut water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not be scared to add a molasses
occasionally, but I would avoid adding
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I certainly wouldn't buy a sugar that
says pineapple or banana or like some
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor that is going to part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's a ventriloquism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at molasses,
like at the grow store, oftentimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheapest molasses because you can feed
it to animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get beat molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They water it down so it's easy to pour
and they make a good margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the grocery store and buy
organic molasses, that's fairly expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: in a little bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we carry a bulk supply of organic
sugarcane molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's better quality, but I don't think
it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the plants are going to produce
its own sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing cover crop, they're
going to be putting sugars out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using them in a compost tea grate,
if you'd like to experiment with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the reasons why the coconut
water works as a finisher is because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: high potassium, not just that it's high
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And historically, when it comes to like
nutrient growing, not living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd start heavy in phosphorus and finish
strong in potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in KNF, they kind of discuss some of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe that's part of the benefit that
we're seeing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have like a specific point like
the compost tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just wanted to get kind of your
overall thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use molasses all the time and I
find myself using it less and less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I've been just using the Build
Soilcraft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using that one cup per plant
every 30 days and it's been getting me
[SPEAKER_00]: through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm becoming more and more hands off as
the years have gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And molasses is one of those things that
I've just stopped doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need to replace it with
another cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Kraft blend, it's funny because I'm
the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never thought I like any individual
ingredients, but you don't want to have 20
[SPEAKER_01]: big 50 pound bags in your house and
scooping out of all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Kraft blend, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it for most things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the coconut water is probably my still
last sugar that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I think of it, I don't think of
sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think of freeze dried liquid
enzymatic coconut, you know, but I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: put enzymes on the label and me trying to
test how long the enzymes are alive and
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, early on there was a forum,
the Living Organic Soil Forum,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was through Afghanistan that we
started after ICMAG closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the arguments in there was how
can you guarantee enzymes in the coconut?
[SPEAKER_01]: It dies immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found white papers that would show
that it survived, but these white papers
[SPEAKER_01]: would keep it frozen the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want people to think they're
guaranteed enzymes, but the most direct
[SPEAKER_01]: replacement for a sprouted seed tea,
which we discussed, would be coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the inside, the liquid that we're all
after, even human.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a million articles on drinking
coconut water for human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's basically a human sprouted
seed tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can use that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, is people would go buy
like harmless harvest, the best,
[SPEAKER_01]: freshest coconut water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're spending like $8 to like spray your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so the freeze dried makes a lot
more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you live where there's coconuts,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to try out the coconut water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody's wondering more about the
craft blend, we actually talked about that
[SPEAKER_00]: in length in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the previous episode we did together
will definitely be linked down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more things I want to get into
before I let you go here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them I want to get into is worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So worms is something I've added into my
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the red wigglers and European night
crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people use the African
night crawlers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But talk to us about incorporating worms
into the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This goes back with our whole theme,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about seed teas because of
enzymes and that natural process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms don't just walk up to food and start
eating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they do is they rub up next to it and
have a mucous membrane that exudes these
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes that are in response to the
material that it's next to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you make a worm bin and you fill it
full of maybe phosphorus rich material,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll be getting more phosphatase enzyme
to break that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the enzyme does its job, the worm can
then absorb through its gut that material
[SPEAKER_01]: that's all bacteria broken down and sludge
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it can improve and utilize it for
its own life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what comes out is actually usually
better than what started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the worms have unbelievable
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I will put the caveat that they are
an invader of the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our forests were built by fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worms came, I believe,
down from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be getting this all wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they're now in the forest layer,
they eat that mulch too quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no good for the trees because they're
relying on it for banks of years of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition and the worms can just devour
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's great for us that are growing fast
growing annual plants because we want that
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition on tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worms are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our vegetable greenhouse, when my wife
just produces these rows of tall tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that's under there is some craft blend
and some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the worms, they go pull it down and
they bring it into soil and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this engine that produces this
constant nutrient supply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's faster than just waiting for it
to decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worms are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to recommend the worms,
the red ones, and the night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to lately just prefer the red
wigglers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Night crawlers are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our thought process was the red wigglers
stay up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The night crawlers go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I just like them in the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't turn it all into a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red wigglers stay more where the food
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to work really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd imagine all of them are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go dig around your property in clay
soil, you'll find earthworms that aren't a
[SPEAKER_01]: composting type of worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those may not be of the same benefit
because they're more for compaction and
[SPEAKER_01]: things are not really going to break down
material as fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the thing to take away is that
they're part of that enzymatic puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create enzymes to help break down
that organic matter that lives in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that turns into plant food.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last question we get is how many,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many do I have?
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation is that we want to put
less than you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the worms multiply to homeostasis
where there aren't as many worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do the reverse and you say,
well, five are good or 100 are good,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put a whole pound I just bought on
line in my one container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And partially because you're like,
what do I do with the rest of the worms if
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use the whole pound?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, start a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have a perpetual source.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put a pound of worms,
which is the thousand red wigglers on
[SPEAKER_01]: average, into a small container of soil,
you're going to turn that into worm
[SPEAKER_01]: casting so fast the worms are going to
overpopulate, start ditching and climbing
[SPEAKER_01]: out, dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd rather not start with too many
worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many and have them die into what's
balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather start with even two,
10, 20, 50, a handful and let them
[SPEAKER_01]: multiply to what's perfect for your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually started a worm bin year,
year and a half ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't looked back, you know,
I free worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, well, I made that one
investment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the worms to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I can just grab them wherever,
whenever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a buddy come over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, hey, some worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grab them from the worm bin and put them
into my pots whenever I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely worth it in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So towards the end of the grow,
you believe in a fade or senescence at the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the growth cycle, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you believe in leaching or
flushing when growing organically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me define those two real quick
because there's so many definitions out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaching defined as not feeding any
organic inputs for the final few weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flushing as defined as running a large
amount of water through the medium in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to reduce the nutrition to starve
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should grows leach or flush their soil at
the end of the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I would actually switch those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're saying is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning when most people say flush,
they're like in hydro, they switch to no
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so many definitions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But leaching traditionally means you're
leaching out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're grab, everything has to
come out on a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You leach, you don't flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as we're clear on what we're
talking about, I agree with neither.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by this is that we worked
really hard to build this soil up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the benefits of living soil is
that you see the genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the genetic potential, what I mean by
that is it's going to determine on its own
[SPEAKER_01]: when the end of its life is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to start to senesce
regardless whether there's fertility in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of what may help this is some colder
temperatures slowing the biology down and
[SPEAKER_01]: the release of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use cold water to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also stimulates some of the
colors and some of the mimicry of colder
[SPEAKER_01]: season coming into winter and to the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting that runoff, it's not going to
change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the thought is that you run
it off so hard that your soil is now
[SPEAKER_01]: devoid of nutrient and now the plant must
starve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is like saying someone who's 90
on their deathbed is going to eat all your
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanksgiving dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even, like it's not even a
thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is dying on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to stop taking food up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you could probably stop watering
the last week or two in a big bed of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has plenty of water and it just doesn't
need as much now that it's ripening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done growing basically at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice because in hydro,
if you picked a genetic and grew it and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you weren't familiar with exactly
when it should be harvested at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: point, you're going to say, oh,
the schedule says switch to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to start to fade because it has
no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're living soil, I like to
give it that choice and it may not start
[SPEAKER_01]: to fade on week seven or eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may fade on week 10, but it does it and
it does it because it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, you know, you've maxed
out your genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gotten all of the different
terpenes and flavors and everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want peaked out and you're finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do like to see the fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say I see difference in some
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quadrant two in our YouTube series right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's dark purple and leathery looking and
the other one's faded line yellow and
[SPEAKER_01]: green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they both senesced in their own
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But flushing would maybe take that purple
and tone it down just a bit, like running
[SPEAKER_01]: water through or just plain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that's a benefit in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that returns me back to saying,
like, look at what's in the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: already in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pouring water on the media is not going to
change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it can do is if there's nothing in
the soil at all and you've prematurely
[SPEAKER_01]: taken everything out of the soil because
you leached and flushed and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now the plant is going to mobilize
nutrients from its leaf, anything mobile
[SPEAKER_01]: into the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to use that as food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just eating its own leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still feel like it's kind of a
viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do say harvesting a dark green plant
early because it wasn't finished,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not as good as a finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that it's because it was
faded, but finishing that plant properly,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it was a light fade or whether it
stayed somewhat perky green, as long as it
[SPEAKER_01]: showed you that it was finished,
I get great, great results out of the end
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's other tricks,
too, like tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know it's getting really cold,
you can actually just go cut the top off
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and force it to finish fruiting
faster so that you get tomatoes before
[SPEAKER_01]: they freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plants kind of have a reaction to
trying to produce and stay alive and to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish their job and to come in there and
start to just dump water or pretend like
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's any reason to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jeremy, we have covered a ton of
different topics in such a short period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, and I have a list of other topics
that we could get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want to see a part three,
maybe we can drag him back for a part
[SPEAKER_00]: three sometime this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe let us know down in the comments
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also list some questions you have for
Jeremy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can go over those in the next
episode as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy, tell the viewers how they can find
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our soil is the best it's ever been.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works phenomenally well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten more quality control in the
back end, lots more testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just happy that we get to keep
investing into this process because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: making a better and better product for our
customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get to experience the benefits of
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to find me is at buildasoil.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a really great team of support.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can email support at buildasoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can live chat, go to our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main goal is that we want to provide
the best quality ingredients to empower
[SPEAKER_01]: you and your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has to come with the education so
that you use them properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can check out our YouTube
channel as well, which I know you've
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's really everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just trying to have fun,
grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you turn this into a hobby and you
start to turn it into a passion,
[SPEAKER_01]: it turns into a lot of questions and a lot
of wonderment and a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these episodes, when you get to ask
me questions, there's so much better than
[SPEAKER_01]: just some FAQ where I read it aloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you picked a lot of topics
that were really good in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is going to be a good
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Jeremy's
YouTube channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love for you to tune into future
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy, thanks once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys.
