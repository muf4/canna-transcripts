[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Dr. Tassa Saldi.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on to the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to get into an issue
that's wiping out commercial facilities
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: 73% of commercial facilities in the US
have been infected, and just in California
[SPEAKER_00]: alone, 90% of cultivation facilities
research tested positive for this viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're talking about today is hoplatin
viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually pretty scary for a number of
reasons, which we're going to get into in
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Tassa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you said, I am the Chief Science
Officer of Tumie Genomics.
[SPEAKER_02]: My background is in molecular biology,
and specifically in a type of biology
[SPEAKER_02]: called RNA biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what my background looks at is how the
shape or the structure of certain
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules can impact cellular metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is pretty on point for
hoplatin viroid because this particular
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen enacts its pathology based on its
three-dimensional shape or its secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I did my graduate and
postdoc work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we founded our company, Tumie Genomics,
a little over four years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we moved into helping cultivators
identify pathogens, and especially this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular pathogen, maybe about three
years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically we had somebody who was
running a nursery contact us and ask us if
[SPEAKER_02]: we could help them identify this
particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were all molecular biologists
actually working on... We started in
[SPEAKER_02]: cancer and then we moved into COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we agreed we could definitely help
identify this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once we realized the breadth of this
issue and how critically the cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: industry needed to have good diagnostics,
more research to understand this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular pathogen, we kind of found our
home as a company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what we've been doing for
the last three years is research
[SPEAKER_02]: collaborations with academia, with
industry, as well as developing reliable
[SPEAKER_02]: diagnostics and even some onsite testing
to help cultivators identify this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep their operations safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly is hoplatin viroid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it down for us and mention how does
it differ from other pathogens?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hoplatin viroid and viroids in general
are one of the strangest and I would say
[SPEAKER_02]: most interesting organisms, if you can
even call them organisms out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most organisms contain, well,
almost all of them except for viroids
[SPEAKER_02]: contain an inside part which has their
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like your DNA, or in viroids
case, it's RNA, which is a molecule very
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the outside of that information is
like a coating that keeps the genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: information or the DNA RNA safe from the
outside environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that outside coating is generally made
of proteins or fats or both.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the same if we're talking about
funguses, bacteria, or even viruses,
[SPEAKER_02]: they all have a coating like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So viroids are incredibly unique in the
sense that they basically say,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't need any of that protection stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just literally free floating
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you think about viroids,
it's much more helpful to think of them
[SPEAKER_02]: like an inert molecule or contamination at
a crime scene instead of like a living
[SPEAKER_02]: organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're incredibly, incredibly small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this makes them very, very contagious
and very easy to pass from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very specific to land plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the most part, except for a few
kind of outlying publications,
[SPEAKER_02]: viroids are exclusive to plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can't hurt people if you were to
consume a viroid or smoke something like a
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco cigarette or something like that
with viroid in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they can be incredibly damaging to
plant development and especially plant
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people are hearing the word viroid and
I'm sure there's quite a few people out
[SPEAKER_00]: there like, viroid, you mean virus?
[SPEAKER_00]: So totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you kind of explained it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else to be said in
regards to the difference between a virus
[SPEAKER_00]: and a viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because viroids are so incredibly
simple, they don't actually have the
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to do any type of metabolism or
even information to code for a metabolism
[SPEAKER_02]: that allows them to replicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So viruses have a unique biology to them,
which is why we can make things like
[SPEAKER_02]: antivirals, for example, because they're
targeting something that is different in
[SPEAKER_02]: viruses than in the organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: That the viruses infect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But viroids are so incredibly simple that
they don't have that unique biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everything that they do is hijacking
the biology of the plant, which makes them
[SPEAKER_02]: incredibly difficult to target because
it's very difficult for whatever we're
[SPEAKER_02]: targeting to differentiate between the
viroid and the plant's normal biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why, as opposed to a lot of
other things, there aren't really any
[SPEAKER_02]: effective treatments or anything that
would specifically target the viroid,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're very difficult to treat because
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And taking a step back and looking at the
big picture, what's the economic impact
[SPEAKER_00]: from this viroid outbreak?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an estimate that for cultivation
facilities across the board, there's more
[SPEAKER_02]: than a $4 billion loss annually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those estimates are just mostly what's
going on in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've found at Tumey Genomics that this
particular viroid is present on pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: much every continent.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tested plant material from Canada,
Africa, Asia, Europe, and it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you mentioned at the beginning,
it's in 70 to 80% of cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can see up to a 30% loss with
plants when they are infected with this,
[SPEAKER_02]: which accounts to a huge amount of money
and a pretty prevalent risk for every
[SPEAKER_02]: single cultivator out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's truly a pandemic at this point in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly on the home-grow side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of my audience is,
but we do have folks that are in
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities, for example,
but I can only imagine what the impact is
[SPEAKER_00]: on the home-grow side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of no testing happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, I know that we're going to
get into how it can be transmitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know seeds is one of them, but yeah,
it's got to be widespread amongst so many
[SPEAKER_00]: folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably have it and they don't even
know that they have it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants that are infected with hoplite and
viroid, what are the symptoms that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see on the plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hoplite and viroid has, what it's
called is pleiotropic, which means that
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a ton of different symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it basically affects every system of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different things that you can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: It affects the growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can see the stunting of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also can affect the shape of how it
grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as opposed to like a normal 45 degree
angle of the branches coming off that main
[SPEAKER_02]: stem, when plants are infected with
hoplite and viroid, the stems tend to come
[SPEAKER_02]: out more horizontally.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see leaf chlorosis, misshapen
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the leaves will overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they'll look too shiny or
depending on the specific cultivar you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at, they can also kind of turn a
little yellow or curled up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rooting is another major issue for plants
that have hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They tend to root very slowly and the root
ball itself is reduced in density.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you plant a clone and it's trying to
root and it just taking forever,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a really good sign that that
particular plant may be infected with
[SPEAKER_02]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course it also affects the
development of flowers on plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the flowers tend to be
underdeveloped, reduced in mass,
[SPEAKER_02]: reduced in chemicals and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of takes down every system
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it renders it whatever, especially if
you're looking for medicinal properties
[SPEAKER_02]: from that particular plant, those
different chemicals are not being
[SPEAKER_02]: produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the plant is not nearly as useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that standpoint.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it hits the plant all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, some of those symptoms that you
mentioned can be done by other things,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned like chlorosis,
for example, there's a number of problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that happen where you get yellowing
leaves, hoplite and viroid is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf overlapping was an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a plant that had leaves
overlapping and I was like, oh no,
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had learned that in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually got that plant tested
and it actually came up negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was a little bit surprised by that
because I hadn't seen that in any other
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that I had grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the overlapping leaves was a
really interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, wow, root development slower,
smaller root ball, undeveloped flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: stunning a growth is just so many
different things that this viroid does to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I should mention that one of the
trickiest and most insidious things about
[SPEAKER_02]: this particular pathogen is that while all
of those symptoms are possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's possible that either only some or
none will manifest in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so even if you're looking at a plant
and you're like, oh, this plant looks
[SPEAKER_02]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks super healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still possible that it's infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely possible that it will
appear asymptomatic during the early
[SPEAKER_02]: stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not going to notice any changes
until that plant grows up into maturity
[SPEAKER_02]: and goes into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then often you'll see those symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's important to understand what
the symptoms could be, but it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: important to realize that you may have an
infected plant and it looks pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the only way to be sure is to get
that test, like you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does hoplite and viroid spread and
what measures can gardeners take to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent its transmission?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hoplite and viroid, like most viroids,
is spread primarily by mechanical means.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what this means for the most
part is it's spread most efficiently by
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're trimming your plants,
for example, and you take those scissors,
[SPEAKER_02]: you trim a plant, and then you move to the
next plant and you don't clean those
[SPEAKER_02]: scissors first, the sap from the
potentially infected plant can infect the
[SPEAKER_02]: non-infected plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the most common way that
hoplite and viroid is spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other potential ways that it's spread,
they can be spread through the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hoplite and viroid can slough off of
root cells or the root cells slough off
[SPEAKER_02]: and contain hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of hoplite and viroid and
infected plants in the root tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if plants are sharing water,
like if they're in a clonal tray or you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing some sort of flood and drain or some
system where plants are sharing water,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can transmit it like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also be transmitted through seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are several studies out now,
and we've also conducted a study showing
[SPEAKER_02]: that seed transmission of this in
medicinal plants is somewhere between 20%
[SPEAKER_02]: to 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also be transmitted in the pollen
to a smaller extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our numbers put it around 5% of the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a male is infected, it can cause the
seeds to be infected as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the final way the potential way
is bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is research that's just coming out
of CSU here in Colorado and Fort Collins
[SPEAKER_02]: showing that there are bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think their research was done on aphids,
if I'm correct, that are capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: transmitting hoplite and viroid from plant
to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pretty much the seeds, water,
and anything that moves plant sap from one
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to another is a potential way that
this thing can spread through a facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or between plants in a home situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's extremely easy to spread.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very contagious and it's very
insidious because you can spread it and
[SPEAKER_02]: not notice for several generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're cloning a plant,
sometimes you're not going to see any
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms until like the second or third
cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden everything goes
to hell and you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that happened to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have plants as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we knew about this,
I think like everybody else out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of a sudden the plants weren't
flowering correctly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't look right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had no idea what was going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it happens all over from huge
cultivation facilities down to someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who's growing at home.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where testing can be so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get into testing here
in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first I do want to ask you,
how long can viroids survive for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though they don't have that
outside protective coat that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: discussing, they're actually incredibly
robust.
[SPEAKER_02]: The shape of viroids, it's a circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like closed at the end and it's
kind of like Velcro.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can think of it like a Velcro
circle that's smooshed onto itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's more like a rod shape than some
sort of free floating, like a noodle or
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that shape affords a lot of stability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So studies right now show they only went
out to 24 hours, but they're definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: stable for 24 hours or more on most common
surfaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be wood, plastic,
metal, cloth, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can survive for up to seven weeks in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have water that's been sitting
around and you keep putting plants in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a potential spread there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they can last for three months or more
in dried up plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really important that if plant
material falls on the ground or you get
[SPEAKER_02]: sap on something that you're cleaning that
up right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in seeds, we've tested seeds at
this point that were more than two years
[SPEAKER_02]: old.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does tend to decrease in frequency
of a seedling that's infected over time,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can still transmit it in the seed
for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually listened to one of your talks,
actually a couple of your talks at Utah
[SPEAKER_00]: State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: I attended there for a cultivation
certificate that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took notes on your talks and yeah,
you nailed it on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of other things you mentioned
there was a greater than 90 days in
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also mentioned several months
in soil or growing medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's part of the, the hard hardest
part about soil is that poplite and virate
[SPEAKER_02]: is incredibly high concentration in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're removing plants from
soil, it's really difficult to not leave
[SPEAKER_02]: some root material behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's, that's one of the hardest
things about growing in soil is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that you, it's difficult to remove
those infections once they, once they've
[SPEAKER_02]: established in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there any plant species or
cultivars that are more susceptible to
[SPEAKER_00]: infection?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hoplite and viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the wild, so in nature, it has a
pretty narrow host range compared to most
[SPEAKER_02]: other viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's infectious, obviously in hops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where the name came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also infect stinging nettle and it
can infect industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in lab settings, they've shown that
they can also infect things like pea
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is yet to be any literature showing
that that's happening out in nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it is a possibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also just completed a study looking at
the susceptibility of different cultivars
[SPEAKER_02]: to hoplite and viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found was it was pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some cultivars that are
incredibly sensitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're very easy to infect.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have really pronounced symptoms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a huge amount of yield loss
when they're infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a battery of cultivars that
are what we call resistant, which means
[SPEAKER_02]: they were difficult to infect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The viroid didn't rise to a very high
concentration until like the very end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's life cycle or the,
or when it's like finishing flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a few outliers,
which I honestly find slightly scary that
[SPEAKER_02]: were taller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these were plants where they had an
incredibly high level of infection,
[SPEAKER_02]: super easy to infect, spread very quickly,
but the plants didn't show any obvious
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms and there was no yield loss.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's wonderful to have those
plants because then you don't notice any
[SPEAKER_02]: problems, but they also are basically a
Trojan horse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might think everything's great
because that plant doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_02]: symptoms, but then it spreads it to
everything else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can go all over the map,
depending on cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Geez.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in regards to testing, what are the
current methods for diagnosing hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: viroid infection in plants and are there
any advancements in the detection
[SPEAKER_00]: technology?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first important point about hoplite
viroid and viroids in general is because
[SPEAKER_02]: they are only that genetic information,
the only type of test that is capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: detecting them is basically a molecular
test.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people were used to thinking about
COVID, there was the antigen test and the
[SPEAKER_02]: molecular test, which was the PCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for viroids, it has to be one of those
molecular tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the major, the two major types of
tests that are out there right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a few exceptions to this,
but the two tests that you're most likely
[SPEAKER_02]: to run into are what's called a PCR test
or an isothermal amplification or a LAMP
[SPEAKER_02]: test.
[SPEAKER_02]: So both of these tests, the way that they
work is they find the viroid in a tube and
[SPEAKER_02]: once it's identified, the test creates a
ton of copies of the viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's two copies in the tube,
what the test will do is make four copies,
[SPEAKER_02]: then eight copies, then 16, then 32 and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so at the end of that copying,
you can have billions of copies and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's easy to detect.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference, so they both do that PCR
and LAMP.
[SPEAKER_02]: The difference between those two is that
PCR is a much more high complexity test.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires very expensive equipment that
can cycle in temperatures and it generally
[SPEAKER_02]: requires specialized expertise to
understand the results.
[SPEAKER_02]: LAMP tests on the other hand are much
simpler.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all run at a single temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that type of test or isothermal
amplification is really appropriate for
[SPEAKER_02]: like a onsite or an at home type of test.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, PCR tends to be more sensitive,
more accurate, more reliable and LAMP
[SPEAKER_02]: tests can often throw false positives,
false negatives, and a lot of them don't
[SPEAKER_02]: contain an internal control, which means
that you can't tell the difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: a failed result and a negative result.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we've been working on at Tumey
Genomics is kind of addressing that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular issue because what we've been
working on is trying to give an option to
[SPEAKER_02]: people that want something at home or
onsite that can allow them to find the
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid in their plants, but with a test
that has the type of accuracy and
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitivity that you would need to be
competent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that we just launched
at Tumey Genomics is an onsite testing
[SPEAKER_02]: platform called Tumeglow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's based on isothermal amplification,
but what we've been able to do with that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular test is increase the
sensitivity to the same range as the PCR,
[SPEAKER_02]: the accuracy to the same range as the PCR,
and include an internal control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you can tell the difference between
the test is negative and I forgot to put
[SPEAKER_02]: plant tissue in the tube or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're really excited about
releasing that or having people look into
[SPEAKER_02]: that because I think this can be a very
powerful tool in fighting back against
[SPEAKER_02]: this pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds convenient for the average home
grower to get testing done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I mentioned earlier on the
podcast, I actually got a test done on one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my plants and I'd like to walk through
the testing process with you if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I remember correctly, this was last
year, I had to take leaf samples off of I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe two or three parts of the plant,
I think it was the top and bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I had to take a sample of the
root as well and then send in for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you walk us through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that just for PCR or is that for the
isothermal test or what's the testing
[SPEAKER_00]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would a home grower do to submit in a
test?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to submit a test, at least with Tumey
Genomics, so we have specialized
[SPEAKER_02]: collection tubes that we mail out to
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason we do this is because those
tubes contain a buffer in there that
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilizes the sample, so we don't have to
worry about stuff degrading, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to be sent on ice, nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: When people are collecting samples,
so we used to actually request that people
[SPEAKER_02]: collect some samples from the foliage and
samples from the root, but we've recently
[SPEAKER_02]: switched to just requesting root.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason this is is that we've done a
pretty comprehensive study that was then
[SPEAKER_02]: confirmed by a bunch of different groups
that the most reliable and accurate tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: to detect this particular pathogen is in
the root.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the foliage, if you're looking for
hoplite and viroid, you have somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: between a 12 to 60% success rate,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the roots, at least in our studies and
what it appears to be in the other studies
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it's close to 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a plant is infected, you're going to
find it in the root first.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the highest level and it's the most
reliable spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people are testing it with the
PCR, they'll take root tissue,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it in a tube, close it, shake it up,
and that's all they have to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll mail it back to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can run the PCR in the lab and then
send them results.
[SPEAKER_02]: For our on-site test, it's exactly the
same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We require root tissue for hoplite and
viroids specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put it in the tube, close it,
shake it up, and then you take some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that liquid out, put it in the reaction
yourself, let it sit in a heat block for
[SPEAKER_02]: some time, and then look at the tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's positive, the tube will glow red
to yellow, somewhere in that range,
[SPEAKER_02]: either red, orange, or yellow,
depending on the viroid load.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's negative, it'll glow green,
and if the test didn't work, it just won't
[SPEAKER_02]: glow at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for both situations, we focus on root
tissue because that's your best chance of
[SPEAKER_02]: catching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the plant is infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's the cost for testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, for the PCR test, the cost is
$25 a test.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have bulk pricing if people want to
get a bunch of tests, but the base cost is
[SPEAKER_02]: 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the at-home test, those start at 18,
but come down very quickly if you buy
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple tests or buy in bulk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it just kind of depends on which
of those two options you like better,
[SPEAKER_02]: but those are the pricing for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 bucks isn't bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other company I went through was
double the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have to go through you for
now, Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's... Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: ToMeGenomics.com, and then you can order
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any tests for anything besides
hoplite and viroids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
We do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also test for fusarium.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the pathogenic forms of fusarium in
medicinal plants, as well as the
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogenic forms of pythium in medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are root pathogens that quite
honestly can be just as damaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the case of fusarium, perhaps even
more damaging than hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're growing indoors,
then those three are the most likely 99%
[SPEAKER_02]: of all of your pathogen issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also have tests that you can order
one test.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll test for all three of those at
once, which if you're bringing in a plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you have a facility or you grow
things at home, it's really important to
[SPEAKER_02]: test and make sure that it's not infected
because the amount of time you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: spend months and all of this material and
your personal time growing it and then to
[SPEAKER_02]: have it die of fusarium or not produce
well because of hoplatent, it's absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: worth getting tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do also offer a whole battery of
viruses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those that are known to infect medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are much more common if you're
growing outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a big buck issue or you're
growing even in your backyard or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, then those are significantly
more common because they're spread by
[SPEAKER_02]: insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can also test water growing
medium and air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're having an issue, like if you
have a facility and you have some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal issues and you think that it could
be in your water, we can help you with
[SPEAKER_02]: that as well or in cocoa or growing medium
or however you're growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in lab, we have a whole bunch of
different things that we can help you
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talking about strategies for managing
or controlling hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's infected a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do from there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, in the case of hoplite
and viroid, there is no cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing you can spray on the
outside of the plant to make it go away or
[SPEAKER_02]: fix it or suppress it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a plant that is highly
infected, your two options are to either
[SPEAKER_02]: toss it or to submit it for a process
called tissue culture, which basically
[SPEAKER_02]: means that they clean up the plant by
putting it through a series of tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: culture steps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture does work, not 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work on every single cultivar,
and it's a very difficult procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that there are, you know,
at home tissue culture kits and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably not one of those
situations where you'd be able to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: The best way to prevent it or the best way
to deal with it is to prevent it
[SPEAKER_02]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just involves not being afraid of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not being afraid of it per se,
but being aware that it's out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: that there are certain steps that you need
to take to keep it from entering into your
[SPEAKER_02]: facility or your home or spreading from
plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, this is one of the things that
really prompted me to clean my trimmers
[SPEAKER_00]: every time between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was doing it a handful of times,
you know, and now and then you hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you hear it's the best practice,
going to prevent pathogens and virus from
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as a home grower,
you just go plant to plant, trim and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: your training, high stress training or
defoliation or whatever, and using
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmers and not cleaning them from plant
to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now knowing that hoplite and viroid is
present, cleaning the trimmers between
[SPEAKER_00]: every single plant is something that I've
been doing religiously now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to confirm what you should be
using for a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some people say, okay, isopropyl
alcohol, that's going to be good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people say, no, isopropyl alcohol
isn't going to kill off the viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use a bleach cleaning solution
instead and dilute it at a one to 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: one part bleach, 10 parts water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your recommendation for that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're talking about viroids,
isopropyl alcohol or any alcohol is
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the worst thing that you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not effective at all in killing
viroids and it actually, alcohol is one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the things we use to stabilize
free-floating genetic information in the
[SPEAKER_02]: lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it actually increases the
transmission of viroid from plant to plant
[SPEAKER_02]: if you use alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they did these studies in,
I believe it was tomato plants with a
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid and they showed that if you do
nothing, absolutely nothing, there's a 75%
[SPEAKER_02]: chance you don't clean those scissors of
spreading it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you dip the scissors in isopropyl and
then cut the plant, it goes up to 95%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just throw the isopropyl out,
use it for something else because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: a good idea for viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be totally honest, it's not 100%
effective on bacteria or fungal pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to limit the spread,
bleach is incredibly effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that 10% solution that you were
talking about, which is one part bleach,
[SPEAKER_02]: nine parts water.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you are going to get bleach,
you want to grab that bleach bottle from
[SPEAKER_02]: the Super Walmart or whatever and make
sure that it has 6% of sodium hypochlorite
[SPEAKER_02]: or higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the active ingredient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you get that bottle home,
put a date on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at six months, you should toss it and
get another one because the activity will
[SPEAKER_02]: go down over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very effective at killing viroids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all you need is 60 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's probably less.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we recommend 60 in case there's goo
and stuff on the scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just needs to sit in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the viroid is completely
deactivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually I recommend, if you're trimming a
bunch of plants, just have several pairs
[SPEAKER_02]: of scissors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just grab one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The others are in the bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're done with one plant,
you put it in the back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you grab the next one in the front.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you always have a supply of
scissors that are clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is caustic on your cutting tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're concerned about them or
they're very valuable to you, put them in
[SPEAKER_02]: there for 60 seconds and then move them
into a cup of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tap water is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will keep them from rusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good info.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you sharing that with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you mentioned earlier it can last up
to seven weeks in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I vision those folks that are doing
deep water culture, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hypothetically, if one of their plants
has poplite viroid, it's in the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets dispersed into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants are being infected there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any best practices in regards to
changing out the reservoir?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it pretty much almost immediate and
there's no getting around it as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: infecting the plant via the water in a
deep water culture system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no way to stop the viroid from
sloughing off the root tissue and then
[SPEAKER_02]: entering into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, it's very stable in the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount that is going to come off those
roots is going to be really dependent on
[SPEAKER_02]: how infected that plant is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it's a low level infection,
then obviously your risk to the other
[SPEAKER_02]: plants is lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the plant that is sloughing off hoplite
viroid is basically on fire with viroid,
[SPEAKER_02]: then a massive amount is going into that
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And your chances of infecting the other
plants is much, much higher.
[SPEAKER_02]: Recirculating systems, deep water culture,
that's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, if you're growing that way,
the best way to protect yourself is to
[SPEAKER_02]: just make sure that any plant you put in
that system, you test first, that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: negative for hoplatent and honestly,
pythium and fusarium as well, which also
[SPEAKER_02]: spread incredibly easily in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pythium is a water mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It loves the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on those types of systems, prevention
is critical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's critical for everybody,
but for those types of things,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's even more important that you test
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to ask, what are commercial
facilities doing about this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have an effective plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they just killing off that plant and
all their plants and starting fresh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there some commercial facilities that
are continuing to grow out the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you said, you know, there is a
reduction in yield, but they'll still be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get to harvest and it doesn't harm
the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned earlier, it's like
there's no, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming it, when you're smoking it,
whatever, it's not being transmitted to a
[SPEAKER_00]: human, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our commercial facilities, are they
killing off plant population and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep their facilities clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you finding some facilities are
actually just like, oh, well, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me segregate this plant to a different
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me continue to grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just won't keep any of the
clones off of these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the answer is it's kind of all over
the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of this is because there aren't
clear regulations for cultivating
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation facilities on how to handle
this kind of thing, you know, or
[SPEAKER_02]: guidelines either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we work with some facilities that
are incredibly diligent about testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything gets tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every mother, you know, just very,
very on top of it, all the way to
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities that don't appear to test at
all and just aren't concerned with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you, if there's a cultivation facility
where plants are identified that have
[SPEAKER_02]: poplite and viroid, we have helped these
facilities deal with this issue without
[SPEAKER_02]: having to basically, you know,
blowtorch everything and start over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the best way to deal with this is
to consolidate your genetic library so
[SPEAKER_02]: that you have two to three plants of each
cultivar and you segregate those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: into a different space in the facility,
which we call like the garden of Eden or
[SPEAKER_02]: your like nuclear stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those plants are tested religiously
and protected from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_02]: facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you can do is slowly move plants
from your genetic library that are clean
[SPEAKER_02]: into this special garden of Eden while you
continue your operations downstream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those plants may be infected,
but you basically kind of let them fall
[SPEAKER_02]: off the end and go into flower and you're
slowly building up this genetic library
[SPEAKER_02]: and eventually all the plant material will
come from this garden of Eden and it will
[SPEAKER_02]: start clean and hopefully stay clean
through the entire process.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are definitely facilities that they
don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to flower the sick plants
because they have photos to me and it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: business and they have money to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of times, you know, if you,
you know, getting like lower quality type
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, it's probably infected because
it's, it's incredibly common.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, that's what, if you,
if it's, you know, the lower quality kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of things, it's probably because it's
infected with hoplite and virate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the homegrown side of things,
would there be any different advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what advice would you have for those
gardeners who receive a positive test for
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and virate on one of their plants
in their garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a homegrown perspective,
because tissue culture is so expensive and
[SPEAKER_02]: extensive, I would just get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not worth your time or your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: To grow that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, we did do a little experiment
ourselves where we just went out and
[SPEAKER_02]: bought a bunch of clones and just to see
what, you know, what we would get from a,
[SPEAKER_02]: from different spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty much every single one of them
was infected with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now granted, we were, we were probably
picking ones that didn't look terribly
[SPEAKER_02]: happy, but if I would definitely,
when you bring in any type of new
[SPEAKER_02]: material, test it right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quarantine it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't plop it right next to your favorite
plants or your favorite strains or
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Test it first in a separate area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it comes back positive, just go back to
where you bought it and say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is sick with something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, give me another one or my
money back or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But whatever you do, do not start growing
that with the rest of your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't start sharing tools and water or
whatever until you confirm that it is
[SPEAKER_02]: negative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to be incorrect, if it's
incredibly safe, I would try to get two
[SPEAKER_02]: negative tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two to three weeks apart, three to four
weeks apart, somewhere in that range,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to make sure that they didn't have a
low level infection in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not worth growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you calculate the amount of money it
takes to grow up a plant and your time and
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights and the electricity and the
nutrients, and then what you have to do if
[SPEAKER_02]: it fails, you know, and, and, and doesn't
produce any, any, you know, medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: properties, then it's just not worth the
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: To not test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should ask this earlier when we were
talking about testing, but are you able to
[SPEAKER_00]: test seeds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can, we can test seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and seeds are an interesting thing
because, um, the, the, the flower of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant tends to have one of the highest
levels of viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, um, if you have a package of
seeds, you don't have to test,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all of them is, you know,
cause some of the times they're pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: expensive for one package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one seed from that package,
um, is sufficient for us to determine
[SPEAKER_02]: whether or not they were, they came from a
mother or a father that had hoplite and
[SPEAKER_02]: viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I would, I would definitely test,
uh, your seeds as well, cause that's
[SPEAKER_02]: another way that it can get into your,
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else that we need to
know about hoplite and viroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I would say just that,
um, I think there's a lot of fear out
[SPEAKER_02]: there right now in the industry about this
particular pathogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's important to know that,
um, this isn't something that people need
[SPEAKER_02]: to be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is just something that people
need to educate themselves on,
[SPEAKER_02]: understand how it works, um, understand
how it's spread, understand how to prevent
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then just put those, uh,
systems into practice, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure you're keeping everything
sterile and clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let anything into your garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you've tested it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you're growing a lot of plants,
routine testing is probably a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if, you know, if you're just
growing a few, you know, in your house or
[SPEAKER_02]: your garden, then, you know, at least test
them before you start growing them to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that they're going to yield what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, just remember prevention is
the smartest way to go about, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, keeping this thing at bay,
um, stopping it from entering in the first
[SPEAKER_02]: place is a whole lot easier and a whole
lot cheaper than fixing a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: After it's happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, there's a solution to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no reason to be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, um, protect yourself and,
uh, you know, it's, it, it's manageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are many other pathogens,
whether it be a virus, a viral,
[SPEAKER_00]: a viroid that's out there that can infect
a wide scale of plants, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get into them here, but can you
kind of leave the audience here with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a cliffhanger?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some other like pathogens out
there that people can look into and
[SPEAKER_00]: research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know there's beet curly top
viruses, lettuce mosaic viruses,
[SPEAKER_00]: tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have maybe a few more that you can
list off that people can look into?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the other viruses that have
published evidence to infect medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are, um, like you mentioned,
beet curly top virus, lettuce,
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorosis virus, um, uh, tobacco streak
virus, alfalfa mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, um, tobacco mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are afraid of this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's no published evidence that it
affects medicinal plants naturally and no
[SPEAKER_02]: published evidence that it can cause
symptoms in plants, in, in medicinal
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, uh, I would say that those four
that I mentioned are the biggest threat
[SPEAKER_02]: currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they're all spread, um, almost
exclusively by insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that's much more,
like I said, on point if you are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, other potential pathogens,
um, especially viroids that exist in hops,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, which have the potential to jump over
into other plants are, um, apple fruit
[SPEAKER_02]: crinkle viroid, hop stunt viroid and
crackling bark viroid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all three of those, um, while there's
no evidence there in, uh, medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, it is highly possible that
those things, um, could, uh, jump,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, across species.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's most important is that you
identify a lab, uh, where you're,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're getting things tested that is
kind of monitoring that stuff and has the
[SPEAKER_02]: scientific chops to, um, develop tests
quickly if those things become a threat in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, one thing, basically the,
the important thing to remember here is no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter what you're facing, if you prevent
entry, if you're careful with
[SPEAKER_02]: sterilization, if you're paying attention,
you can protect yourself from both the
[SPEAKER_02]: known pathogens as well as anything that
might be coming down the pike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's just important to put those
protections in place and, um, it'll be all
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so much good info in this podcast
episode today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually a topic that we haven't
gotten into on this podcast yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really honored to have an expert on
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can break it down for us and give us all
the details and what we need to know and
[SPEAKER_00]: how to test symptoms and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and maybe talk about some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you can find us at tumigenomics
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also, um, on Instagram at
Tumigenomics, uh, LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can go to our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there's all sorts of ways to get ahold
of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can send us an email.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a phone number.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's even a live chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if you just want to plop in there and
ask a question about hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always happy, um, to just help out
with, with questions, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if you're not ready to test,
you just want to understand the process
[SPEAKER_02]: better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, please reach out and get in touch with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, like I said, things that are
coming out or just recently came out would
[SPEAKER_02]: be our onsite testing platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you can also reach out to us and
ask us questions about that, like how,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how to obtain it and understand
it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we are also working on developing,
um, hopefully, uh, soon, uh, what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: a next generation sequencing type
diagnostics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, what this can do for you is
instead of you knowing what's wrong with
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant, you can say, this plant
doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to send in some tissue and we
can basically agnostically look at it and
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you, um, what's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to know that it's
hoplite and viroid or know that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: lettuce, chlorosis or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we can, we can kind of test for
everything all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something else that we're,
we're hopefully coming out with soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, people can just look
for, if they don't know what's wrong,
[SPEAKER_02]: they can look for whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, those are the, those are the
things that hopefully will be out in a
[SPEAKER_02]: reasonable period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to you down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people easily be able to navigate to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much once again for coming onto
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it and hope you enjoy
the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for the opportunity to
speak with you and you as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a wonderful day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
Bye.
