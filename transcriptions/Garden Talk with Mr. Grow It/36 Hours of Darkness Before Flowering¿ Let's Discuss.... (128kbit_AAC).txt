[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching my actress channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a topic video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually a topic slash discussion
video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I definitely want to get
your feedback on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every morning I wake up and I drink a
cup of coffee and I pull out a book and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't start drinking my coffee until I'm
reading my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I get myself to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the current book I'm reading right now
is MJ Horticulture, The Indoor Outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Grower's Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is by Jorge Cervantes,
absolute classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this version came out in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've browsed through this before,
but now I've gone back to it and now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: reading it cover to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that really jumped
out on me is on page 164.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the section on lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to read this off to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get your feedback in the
comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that I've done to my
plants, which is give it a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness between vegetation and flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave my plants a period of darkness and
thought that it went to flowering faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it started flowering faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did it to some other plants and
didn't think that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure if this truly works
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But reading this book kind of gave me some
hope again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have talked about this idea to
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for example, Mike over on Patreon is a
Patreon supporter.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he experimented with this as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I forget what he said off the top of
my head, but I believe he said that it did
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me read off these few sentences
here and then we'll talk from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what it says on page 164, give plants
36 hours of total darkness just before
[SPEAKER_00]: inducing flowering with 12-12 photo
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: This heavy dose of darkness sends plants
an unmistakable signal to flower sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow is using this technique to report
that plants normally show signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, such as pistol formation,
within two weeks and develop pistols after
[SPEAKER_00]: a week of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow has ever experimented with giving
plants up to 48 hours of total darkness to
[SPEAKER_00]: jumpstart flowering and have found that 36
hours, three continuous 12-hour nights,
[SPEAKER_00]: is most effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this is something I've done with
my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually before even reading this,
I've given my plants a period of darkness
[SPEAKER_00]: just thinking that the additional darkness
would kind of give them that jumpstart
[SPEAKER_00]: into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're not talking about autoflowers
here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflowers stay on the same light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep them on like an 18-6 light
cycle, for example, throughout their
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is for photo period plants which need
a period of extended darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around 12 hours of complete darkness
and then the plant will start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the darkness period,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_00]: What actually happens with the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is it produces a hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hormones called fluorogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called a flowering hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once those fluorogen levels have built
up, then it will start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my thought process behind this would
give that plant an additional period of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those fluorogen levels would build up
and then it would start to flower sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did this for several grows and I thought
I could see the transition happen faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then I did it for another grow and it
didn't seem to transition faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of just shook it off and then
stopped doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then reading this makes me want to do
it again and experiment with it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to know you guys out
there who are growing, who have maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: tried this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you give your plants a period of
darkness between the vegetation stage
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the flower stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm talking about photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for photo period plants, do you give
your plants 24 hours of darkness,
[SPEAKER_00]: 36, 48 hours of darkness, and then go into
the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do that, have you seen a faster
transition of flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: So showing signs of sex faster than when
you don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all I wanted to cover in
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link this book down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely recommend it for intermediate
to advanced growers, beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I bought this when I was a
beginner and a lot of it just went over my
[SPEAKER_00]: head to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're trying to take your grow up
to the next level, this one is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: a good read.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
Peace.
