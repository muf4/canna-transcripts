[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I tried cocoa, I just, I never looked
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the ability to control EC and
water content and all the variables of
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa are just so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you stress them a little bit and make
them think in flour, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this might be the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go into a hyper growth
mode and they're going to put out more
[SPEAKER_01]: calyxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really you want to make sure that
from the time that cutting roots or that
[SPEAKER_01]: seed pods that you have momentum through
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that that's one of the biggest
things that will lead to a decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of those things are basically
telling the plant like, Hey, you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: get on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do think that there's a lot of
those techniques that can lead to much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Nick
Schweitzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 26 years and is
an owner of Grow Strong Industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about balancing
the health and stress of plants in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to maximize yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Gorilla Grow Tent for sponsoring
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla is well known for their quality
grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a super strong frame,
thick canvas density, and a height
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusting roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a one foot extension kit and
a two foot extension kit is optional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can grow even taller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the light line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same quality as the original Gorilla Grow
Tents, but with a few key design changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to their website, growstrongindustries
.com and use discount code MRGROWIT for
[SPEAKER_00]: 15%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Nick Schweitzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about creating a
balance between the health of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and stressing them in order to produce
maximum quality and quantity with the
[SPEAKER_00]: right tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like spectrum control,
nutrients, environment, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have, from what I hear,
extensive knowledge in doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to hear what you have to
talk to us about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm co-owner and COO of Grow Strong
Industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Grow Strong Industries is the parent
brand for Gorilla Grow Tent, Kind LED grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights, Lotus nutrients, and Super Ponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess my plant medicine journey
kind of started growing up in Portland,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was lucky enough to be surrounded by
very talented cultivators and some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best plant medicine on the planet really
at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of really where my
interest in plant medicine all started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 97, I moved out to Colorado to
be a ski bum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of my friends at the time
were doing indoor gardens in the mountains
[SPEAKER_01]: of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where my interest in
indoor gardening started or my fascination
[SPEAKER_01]: with it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the fact that these guys were
growing, you know, huge rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, above, you know, 10,000 feet in
elevation, you know, in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: winter when it was snowing with five feet
of snow on the ground was really just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of mind blowing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where my interest kind
of got going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was lucky enough to start helping them,
you know, which is general garden
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance, you know, start kind of
getting tips and tricks and starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn, you know, the lay of the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2001, I moved out to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that time, California was just kind of
blossoming from, you know, some medical
[SPEAKER_01]: laws that had just been passed about five
years earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I started running my own
indoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've been doing it ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been involved in small
gardens, large gardens, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of really ran the gamut with my,
you know, cultivation experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of through those trial and
errors, whichever grower goes through,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's kind of what led me to be
able to design products for Grow Strong
[SPEAKER_01]: Industries and all those brands that
really kind of solve the pain points.
[SPEAKER_01]: That a lot of growers face.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's kind of a decade
on from now, you know, designing all those
[SPEAKER_01]: products and kind of, you know,
doing what our core mission is,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, giving everybody the
chance to have availability to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine that they grew, that they saw
through the process is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's kind of what keeps us going
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just do want to say thank you ahead
of time, because Grow Strong Industries is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually a sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of the viewers have seen
probably the promotions I've done for your
[SPEAKER_00]: brand in the past and you support me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say thank you to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these episodes, a lot of these
episodes wouldn't even be out there
[SPEAKER_00]: without sponsorship support and,
you know, being able to release content,
[SPEAKER_00]: normalize is eventually going to help
legalize in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for supporting the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're on the same mission,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're trying to teach people how
to have access to their own plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, how to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that goes for indoors,
that goes for outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, we believe really that
that kind of is a human right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is to be able to grow your own
vegetables and plant medicine and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're aligned in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many different ways to
grow plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Different styles, I guess you can call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people grow indoors, some outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are in soil or culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa or even hydroponic system,
organic, synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your grow style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, growing outdoors is
beautiful, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, utilizing Mother Nature for most
everything you need is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, you know, in terms of plant
medicine, indoors has always been my
[SPEAKER_01]: realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And largely that's, you know, what our
company does, you know, is make products
[SPEAKER_01]: for indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's something about indoor
that just allows you to kind of control,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what is going on, control the
inputs to, you know, to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, honestly, as we all know,
you know, the quality of what comes out of
[SPEAKER_01]: an indoor facility is bar none.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I've always been an indoor
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for many years, I was soil and I
love soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but once I tried cocoa,
I just, I'd never looked back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the ability to control EC and
water content and all the variables of
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa are just so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, when you look at the
root base that you can make in cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're talking about a medium that
can have 90% water saturation and still
[SPEAKER_01]: have plenty of air to create a massive
root base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I saw the root bases that I
was able to achieve in cocoa, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no going back, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so cocoa has been my style for,
you know, probably the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I use the two-per mix from Royal
Gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super good at what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's always been cocoa
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of, you know,
fertilizer, you know, I tend to move away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the synthetic terminology,
but I do use fertilizer salt formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I use my nutrient, which is
Lotus nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super simplistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, kind of all-in-one
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really never seen anything easier to
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, back in the day when I was doing
soil, I'd have a 12-part nutrient recipe
[SPEAKER_01]: that was honestly a pain in the butt to
keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving to something like Lotus was
great, you know, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of what drove the innovation of that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in terms of my end goal,
in indoor cultivation is always for the
[SPEAKER_01]: highest amount of biomass I can possibly
get out of the inputs that I'm putting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that ultimate bag appeal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I want the plant medicine that's
in a jar across the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I've always found that,
you know, fertilizer salts over organics
[SPEAKER_01]: is the way to achieve the combo of both of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, I'm an advocate for organic,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, organic out in the vegetable
garden always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the flavor profiles of the
smoke that you can get from organic is
[SPEAKER_01]: second to none.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but for a lot of our clients,
commercial and home hobbyists,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're really looking to maximize weight
and quality, which is why we've always
[SPEAKER_01]: tended towards fertilizer salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a, I think there's a
balance between biomass and quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just go for biomass,
biomass, biomass, and all of a sudden you
[SPEAKER_00]: have like fox tailing buds, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it diminishes that bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there are things that you can do
in order to get high biomass, but also
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain that quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what this topic is going
to be today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with, let's start with
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us like what grow light do
you currently use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously Kind LED is the brand that I
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, currently I'm growing with our X
squared, which is our commercial fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and it's a beast of a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts out, you know, a ton of usable
photons, you know, and I think it's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a good starting point,
you know, to talk about this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: health of the plant being the base versus
the stress that we're giving, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant, you know, cause really in,
you know, there's a lot of really high
[SPEAKER_01]: powered LEDs out on the market today that
honestly, I think a lot of people have no
[SPEAKER_01]: clue what to even do with them at full
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have all of the other inputs
in your room, a hundred percent dialed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are not going to be able to utilize
all of the photons coming out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those variables are EC, it's water
content, it's CO2 levels, it's VPD levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all of those things need to be dead
on in order for you to even be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize a thousand PPFD at plant canopy
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've actually seen some of your
past guests that talk about like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I just need to use that light at
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so it's like, you know,
it's probably the fact that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting better growth because some of
their other variables are off and not to
[SPEAKER_01]: knock their growing style, you know,
but that's typically, if you turn your
[SPEAKER_01]: light up and you see light stress
happening, that's, that's what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing that the other variables
aren't up to snuff and that engine is
[SPEAKER_01]: running too fast for the other pieces to
keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I think it's really
important to have all of the balance
[SPEAKER_01]: between these things that we're about to
talk about in order to utilize that high
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and so, and so for me,
the X2 is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a variable spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, you know, tune it to a veg
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tune it to a flower spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with what we call the targeted
spectrum, which is basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: us not relying so much on, you know,
white light LED, it's got really high
[SPEAKER_01]: peaks in the yellows and the greens that,
you know, five to 600 nanometer
[SPEAKER_01]: wavelength, you know, but it kind of has a
more targeted spectrum, which is a more
[SPEAKER_01]: usable spectrum to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, find that we can really
crank all those variables up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get really high EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can utilize CO2 to the max and we can
get some pretty outstanding, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: weights from our harvests as a result of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, in terms of stress for
light level, typically those aren't going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be good for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about, you know, beneficial
stressors to the quality of flower when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to light, we're more talking about
UV light, you know, and exciting the UVR8
[SPEAKER_01]: protein to kind of crank up that secondary
metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have people that drastically
change their spectrum the last like week
[SPEAKER_01]: of flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They crank all their reds down,
all their whites down and go with the
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy blue and that same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stressing the plant out and kind of
kicking up that secondary metabolite
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are little tips and tricks
that you can do with lighting to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: bring out that stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're talking about low light
levels or high light levels, those are
[SPEAKER_01]: typically the stressors that don't benefit
you and more kind of lock out your plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: if anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the record, I'm one of the ones that
dim my grow lights in order to get through
[SPEAKER_00]: my grow because I don't supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm not running a 1400 ppm and so CO2
is my limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if I don't dim my lights,
I'm going to fry my plants because my CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: levels aren't up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I started using some CO2 and we'll get
into CO2 later on in this episode because
[SPEAKER_00]: that is something that can be used to
increase biomass, which is on the topic
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for the most part, I do like to
dim my lights and make sure that I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: running into foxtail issues, which happens
to me a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat raises up, foxtailing occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like we mentioned earlier,
the bag appeal just kind of diminishes on
[SPEAKER_00]: that avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dives, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look, I've given that X2 to
friends or the X squared to friends of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine who have been growing longer than me
and do it on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes them a minute to get used to
how much light is actually coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always like, man, you got to go
harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to go harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, EC, and old school grower mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, ah, I can't really crest this
threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they finally learned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you have to crest that threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they do, they're like,
oh my God, it was like amazing the results
[SPEAKER_01]: that I started getting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, the whole growing in general
has been flipped on its head in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: five years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of the things that we never
thought to do or never thought were safe
[SPEAKER_01]: zones, and we'll get into that with the
BPD thing, is now like, oh, that is where
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be and look at the effect of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you touched upon how you use your grow
light to maximize the yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about light levels and
spectrum, but kind of getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more detailed onto light levels,
PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some people who go for
specific PAR levels throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of growth, or some people
look at DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any specific PAR levels that
you're targeting for the different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth in order to maximize the yield
or quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at certain plant medicines,
DLI is anywhere in the kind of like 40 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with sometimes reaching those
DLI levels is that when you're reaching
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum DLI levels, which would be maximum
PPFD levels at plant canopy to achieve
[SPEAKER_01]: that, divided by the number of hours your
light is on, it really rolls back to all
[SPEAKER_01]: those other variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say in a typical home-grow
scenario, getting over 700 or 800 PPFD at
[SPEAKER_01]: plant canopy level is probably going to
give you more problems than it is benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we could speak in terms of like
100% dialed environment, commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, yeah, I mean, I would say
cloning stage, you're looking at 150-ish
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD is plenty to carry out the cloning
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Young veg, anywhere from four to 450 PPFD
is usually what we target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in flower, I do have people that
slowly ramp up through flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never really been my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of go all or nothing from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm usually in that 800 to 1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,000 is tough though, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, 1,000, you better have all of your
other variables dead on in order for that
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do, the results are amazing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would probably say I tend more
towards that 800-ish range because I can
[SPEAKER_01]: be lazy sometimes about making sure that
my temp and humidity are perfectly dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes when you don't have those
controls, when everything's not completely
[SPEAKER_01]: automated, tending towards the lower end
of that spectrum is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's counterintuitive to the way most
people think, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, I give my plant less light,
and it does better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, it just has to do with the
harmony amongst all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, probably about that 800-ish range
in full flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The margin of error is much less at those
lower PPFD levels, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can have an EC swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a water content swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't affect the plant as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're redlining it, it better all be
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already mentioned you're using
Lotus nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you aim for different EC or PPM during
the different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it really has to do with the
amount of light that you're giving your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, all your other variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, all these variables kind of count
on each other to give you the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: what you take lighting to or EC to and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when using high PPFD lighting,
like the X squared, I mean, I come right
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the gates at about 1,000 PPM,
which I've told people that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, whoa, like really?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've noticed that if you don't,
you can get a little clone to lock out
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty quick, because with that amount of
light and with CO2 augmentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just wants to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1,000 PPM, that's what, 2.0 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm typically drifting towards probably
1,300.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards the latter stages of the
vegetative stage and into flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about 2.6 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through the first, about every
two weeks in flower, I'm stepping it up
[SPEAKER_01]: about 100 PPM until I get to about 1,800,
which is 3.2 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I feel like that's not even
enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the plants are just soaking it up
and just taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a lot of commercial clients
that are growing way higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've got a lot of people that are
in that 3.6 to 3.8 EC range.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you talk about crop steering
techniques, I mean, sometimes they're
[SPEAKER_01]: touching the like 5.0 range, which is
insane to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, if you don't have an
automated system, similar to like an
[SPEAKER_01]: Arroia, you're playing with fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're playing with fire above 3.0 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: If everything else isn't 100% dialed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so I kind of slowly ramp up
through flower and usually end at 3.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how about pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people monitor the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said you're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different pH ranges for soil
versus cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll have to admit pH is something
that I don't check all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because I know the pH of my inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my nutrients really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where when I mix to a certain
nutrient strength, it's going to be at
[SPEAKER_01]: about this pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know how much up and down to choose.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, it's like I don't check it
every time, but I am trying to go into
[SPEAKER_01]: that 6.0 to 6.2 range in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, soil, obviously, you're drifting
a little bit higher, sometimes all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: up to like 6.5, 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in hydro, you're obviously going
lower, you know, all the way down to like
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa, I'm trying to stay in that 6.0 to
6.2 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's like that's one of
those things where sometimes after you've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown for a while, after you kind of get
used to the nutrient program that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using, it becomes kind of intuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes for feeding, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sometimes I'll be in there and
I'll be on a 1500 ppm level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, they look like they
want a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, ah, you know, it looks like
a little bit of tip burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pull back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I think it's important
to kind of be intuitive in gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: too, not just always following the
instruments, not just always following the
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe, because that can get you into
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's largely the issue I
have with these full automations that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it wants to be loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to be paid attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, every once in a while,
you need to kind of adjust your game plan
[SPEAKER_01]: based on your intuition of what you're
seeing in the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had really good luck doing 5.8 pH
going in to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's a little bit more
simple than soil at times, controlling pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like soil is so many things
in the actual medium that's adjusting the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants releasing acids, there's microbes
in there, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for cocoa in particular,
since you're a cocoa grower, I forgot to
[SPEAKER_00]: mention it, 5.8 pH is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually do start a little bit under
6.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually start at like 5.9, which is a
weird number, and then slowly kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: raise it up over the course, which kind of
just naturally happens as I build strength
[SPEAKER_01]: in my nutrient program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so I mean, runoff is an
important one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in fact, I think it's almost for
me more important to check my runoff every
[SPEAKER_01]: once in a while than it is to check my
inbound nutrient solution just to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that there's nothing funky going on
in the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would 100% recommend that to anybody
that's growing cocoa or soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then in terms of like
stressing with nutrient strength,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really think there's anything
there, you know, in terms of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think if you underfeed,
I don't think that will ever really go too
[SPEAKER_01]: well for you unless your inputs are off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it could be the thing that saves
your garden, right, is by underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, overfeeding, yeah, if you have
all your inputs on, you can really kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: get to that, you know, level of pushing
the plant, ultimately making a healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: base for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you talk about the irrigation side
of things and the water content in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium, now you're talking about a stress
that can have a beneficial effect on the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm kind of a wildflower nut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they always say the best year to go
out and see wildflowers is after a drought
[SPEAKER_01]: year, which is kind of counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the plant saying, Oh,
my God, we don't have enough water to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they end up making more seed stock
and drop it on the ground because for an
[SPEAKER_01]: annual, that's the point is to continue on
with life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's the same thing with plant
medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you stress them a little bit
and make them think in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, this might be the end,
they're going to go into a hyper growth
[SPEAKER_01]: mode and they're going to put out more
calyxes that are for hopefully in nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would want that to become a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want that in indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but that's kind of the the
mode they go into, they go into survival
[SPEAKER_01]: mode and they say, I need to regenerate as
much as possible to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to counteract the conditions being put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you want the exact
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in vegetative stage,
you want that stress to be non-existent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want the fastest, most healthy,
robust growth you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we want more water content
in the soil during that period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once you get into flower,
letting them kind of dry a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's called a dry back and in
crop steering techniques is actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a good stressor for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was even thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so you're saying later on in flowering
around what weeks would you say would you
[SPEAKER_00]: typically do drought stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, typically, I mean, you know,
in, in crop steering techniques,
[SPEAKER_01]: they say after week three, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, weeks one through three,
that's where it's still really kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in that stretch stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it gets into week three, you've got
good flower development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you kind of want to start
introducing that stress, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is basically, you know, when you
irrigate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You irrigate, you cut off your irrigation
more towards the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if in cocoa, if you're doing
high-frequency fertigation and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing multiple shots or irrigation times
through the day, you want to cut that off,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, three or four hours before your
lights turn off and let that dry period
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of go for a little bit longer than
you normally would rather than irrigating
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up until the lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even when the lights are off,
which some people do, which is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping that medium wet enough that that
plant's like, I have everything I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't get that kind of kick in
the butt to say, oh man, I need to start
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to start really producing,
you know, what's, what's ultimately going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be my survival.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to play around with drought
stress a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tough thing is, is like when you're
growing with organics, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's often advised to keep the medium
moist at all times because the amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: there need to be broken down by microbes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes need to be active amidst dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not there breaking down that
organic matter and turning them into
[SPEAKER_00]: usable nutrients for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the mineral nutrient side,
yeah, I mean, I used to actually do that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I think about it is when I water,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime I water, you do the old,
uh, stick your thumb down in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if for the top inches bone dry,
then you know the water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe that's a form of drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually helping with some of
those secondary metabolites, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to play around with it a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're not talking about driving
the medium out to where leaves are,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, folding down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, uh, drought stress can be,
you know, just letting the, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the medium dry out a little bit more than
you usually do, you know, not to where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's affecting microbial life,
um, you know, but, but to where it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, telling the plant, Hey,
you know, you might not be getting water
[SPEAKER_01]: again for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you better go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's a good point is,
um, you know, one of the things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to stress the most about just the
overall cultivation experience is that
[SPEAKER_01]: most plant medicines rely hugely on
momentum, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Momentum is so big for having those
perfect harvests with the most weight and
[SPEAKER_01]: the best quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that momentum can be thrown off in
a lot of ways, you know, either you rooted
[SPEAKER_01]: your clones and you were a week late to
getting them into, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: medium you're using, or you were late to
transplant into a bigger pot, or they
[SPEAKER_01]: dried out too much to the point where they
were wilting, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those things will stop that
momentum of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just one event like that will have a
huge impact on your final harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really you want to make sure that
from the time that cutting roots or that
[SPEAKER_01]: seed pops, that you have momentum through
the entire process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I found that that's one of the biggest
things that will lead to a decreased
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, uh, is some kind of stress event
somewhere along or large stress event,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say, um, you know, that,
that ends up taking the momentum out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, let's start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperature do you typically aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, indoors, I mean, you know,
setting, uh, has a lot to do with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, where you live and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I think for home growers,
temperature and humidity are obviously two
[SPEAKER_01]: of the things that are the hardest to
control, um, you know, in small settings,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, you know, unusually aiming for about
82 is kind of my comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, all the way up to,
you know, maybe 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I know people that run their
rooms even hotter than that, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, it's just uncomfortable
to work in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's really that great,
uh, you know, for the plants, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, anything lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, old school HPS days,
we, you know, 76 to 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that was before we had VPD and all
that kind of jazz, uh, happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, 82 is my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, you know, adjusting
temperature, if you can't get humidity up
[SPEAKER_01]: that high is a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, when you look at
temperature, you really want to be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at temperature and humidity combined for
that VPD measurement, uh, and staying
[SPEAKER_01]: within a healthy, healthy VPD range,
if at all possible, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of these humidity levels
that we're starting to talk about these
[SPEAKER_01]: days, you know, tell that to an old school
grower 20 years ago, and they think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: insane, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, 82 degrees, I think proper VPD in
that range is 72, 74 ish percent humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: and all, you know, a grower would be like,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's not, I mean, that's where
stomata are breathing healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the plant is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And powdery mildew attacks unhealthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not humidity that causes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, humidity can exacerbate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I mean, uh, you know,
sport production, uh, or reproduction
[SPEAKER_01]: happens at high humidities, but that's not
what the cause of powdery mildew is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's actually an unhealthy plant and
an unhealthy plant is a plant that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really about keeping those stomata
open and functioning and breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so really it boils down to VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question for you was what relative
humidity do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've answered that, uh, you know,
so at 81 degrees, Fahrenheit temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's around 70% relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you've mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, I think at 82, I think it's
72 to 74, I think is this is the safe
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that for the entire grow or is that
only for veg and then you kind of lower it
[SPEAKER_00]: for flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, typically in veg is
when you will see the higher, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people do kind of pull back,
um, for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, even in late flour,
I'll pull that back even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, when, when you have huge,
you know, swollen flowers, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I always kind of get a little
bit gun shy at keeping my humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it is where I'd be at 72,
74 during veg and probably pull that down
[SPEAKER_01]: to like 65, 68 during flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd probably pull that down even
further to like 60, 62 during those like
[SPEAKER_01]: last couple of weeks of flour,
just so I can make sure that I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any other problems, uh, you know,
like bud rot or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, CO2, I know you mentioned that
you supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you supplement CO2 and then what
level PPM do you typically aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CO2 again, it all has to do with the
other variables, light levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of these things are
interconnected as you're seeing that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of my theme.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so with CO2, I mean, the easiest
way to, uh, augment CO2 is probably a CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, uh, it's, you know, lugging
tanks in and out of your house,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, isn't, uh, very discreet for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, it's also a pain in the butt,
like, you know, lugging the tanks to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydra store or the gas store to get them
filled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so a CO2 burner is probably the
easiest way, uh, I think appropriate pain
[SPEAKER_01]: lasts pretty long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but you do have to deal with the
excess heat coming off of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: a CO2 burner and they might not be
practical for smaller applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, CO2 burner for a room
four to 10 lights, uh, is probably
[SPEAKER_01]: practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how I've always done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've always ran in the like 1200 to
1500 PPM range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that seems to work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of people going all the way up
to like 2,500 PPM, um, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot and it's a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I've heard, you know, people
having great results with as little as
[SPEAKER_01]: like 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think ambient CO2 is somewhere
in the 400 to 450 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so for someone like you,
who's not augmenting CO2, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: refreshing that room to get that ambient
CO2 back to levels is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I've had great success even at,
at 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been playing around a little bit
with supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I got those TMB naturals canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried those off for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very expensive using those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am currently trying out the mushroom
bags, 365 exhale bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have that hanging above the plants
and, uh, it, I do have a CO2 monitor in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monitoring the PPM, it does raise it,
but it's not constant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I have my exhaust set up is AC
infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I have the set point set,
so when it reaches 82 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for the same temperature you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it'll start exhausting out some of
that heat and it will take some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's the unfortunate thing about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but I think I.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, try it out and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does raise up to CO2 quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, I think whenever you
don't have, you know, tanks or a CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: burner, I mean, any kind of augmentation
that you can get in there is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, and the mushroom bags are
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, mushrooms, I think they're
probably going to save our world at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I wholeheartedly support those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I mean, you know,
anything you can do to get those levels up
[SPEAKER_01]: to better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about air circulation and air
exchange?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those things are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you use that for precision stress
at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you know, air circulation is
probably one of the more underrated,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and underutilized, uh, you know,
theories in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, getting proper air
circulation in a grow room is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, a lot of people have
circulation fans that kind of just blow at
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants, uh, and, you know,
move air around a little bit around that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, immediate vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really what you're trying to do is get
as much circulation in that room as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible so that you're getting air
through the canopy and not just blowing at
[SPEAKER_01]: the canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of those crevices where
all those leaves are kind of in close
[SPEAKER_01]: proximity, you know, the humidity levels
within those little pockets can be
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a lot higher than what your
sensor is actually telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting air movement through that whole
entire canopy is super, super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you know, it's in terms of
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, blowing wind on those plants is
just like blowing wind in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to tell that plant,
Hey, you need to produce stockier stems,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, to support, um, you know,
the wind that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't have light stress on the
plant that actually makes it sturdier,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, through air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then in your case, right,
turning over that air and backing that air
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the room so that you get ambient
CO2 to be replenished, uh, is super
[SPEAKER_01]: important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stale air is never a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you're doing CO2 augmentations,
a little bit different of an equation
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're trying to actually keep
that atmosphere in the room, keep those
[SPEAKER_01]: really high levels of CO2 because,
you know, again, it's either coming from a
[SPEAKER_01]: tank or it's coming from a burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes no sense to pull that out of
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I would still do probably every 24
hours, a full room refresh just to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pull the staleness out of the air,
get everything cycled, uh, and then turn,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the exhaust system off and kind
of get back to, uh, you know, that high
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, airflow is very underrated,
uh, in grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, a lot of problems
end up getting caused by lack of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you that the air
circulation is underrated and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, air exchange as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually doing a grow right now where
I have one plant that is just covered in
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes and it's right next to the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one, same cultivar,
different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't, it's not really a fair
comparison, but, um, the one during
[SPEAKER_00]: directly next to the fan is just covered
in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's that theory of wind stress,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that wind stress actually causing it to
produce more trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard to prove.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think anybody's ever proven that
yet, but, uh, but that's something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: often said that can help cause precision
stress, you know, and help help that
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what it all boils down to,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime a plant is stressed, it says,
you know, I mean, secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, there for the plant to
attract insects, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: make more, uh, seed stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of the things that,
you know, are kind of like it's survival
[SPEAKER_01]: tactics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you introduce stress, that's what
it starts to kick into high gears,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of those things that it needs to,
you know, basically survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so wind stress probably can
absolutely do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, and then, you know,
really if one plant has better air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation around it throughout its
growing cycle, then some of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: behind it, it could just have a more
healthy base and be a healthier plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: general, allowing it to, you know,
be better quality when it's done,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you need a healthy plant in order
to take the stresses that we give them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a healthy plant and you
give it stress, it's going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's going to go south on you,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to lock out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to, you know, be a weak
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a healthy plant and then you
bring those stresses in, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have, you know, a good effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is that plant's going to be like,
well, now I'm kicking all these processes
[SPEAKER_01]: into high gear, secondary metabolites,
seed production, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, calyx production.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really, really good point there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we could talk about
biomass, increasing yield and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: without talking about plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's often done manipulating a
plant in different ways, doing training,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be a low stress training,
high stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different things that
you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do for plant
training in order to maximize yield or
[SPEAKER_00]: quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think, you know, when you,
when you talk about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant training, I mean, obviously yield is
a huge one, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can train a plant five different
ways and get five different results in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, where that technique comes
in, I think is when you are limited in
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant numbers that you can grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here in California, um,
we're allowed to grow six plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, with, you know, with the rec laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you can only grow six plants,
I mean, some of these kinds of super
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping techniques are, you know,
pinching off and, you know, really
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to spread out that top canopy and
get a lot of different flower sites can be
[SPEAKER_01]: massive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can quadruple your yield that
you can get off of just four plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, in my, uh, in my experience,
it really does boil down to the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some strains just don't take to that
kind of stress as well as others.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen certain strains that don't want
to be topped.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be pinched.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they do much better by just letting
them grow, letting that apex flower happen
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of that lateral branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you get the highest
yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen other strains that perform
poorly in that, in that way, and they want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be topped and they want, they want to
have, you know, multiple lateral branch
[SPEAKER_01]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that that's, uh,
you know, can be strained specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but for my style of growing,
I'm usually, you know, want to be as low
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't get over crazy with my training
techniques or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and so I usually top once if
it's a strain that allows that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I kind of just let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I usually flip into flower at a pretty
young age, so I'm not doing a ton of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stress training or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in terms of, um, you know,
leaf stripping, um, you know, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the week before flower leaf stripping,
the three week leaf stripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, again, that's, that's all,
those are all those little signs of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant saying, wow, I just lost all this
foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to kick into overdrive,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to kick into overdrive my,
you know, you could make the argument that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're now getting light further down into
the canopy because some of those leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: are not existing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I buy into that as much,
but when you're stripping the plant of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, it's like, man, I need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to start, you know, reproducing all
those leaves so I can get back to having
[SPEAKER_01]: my, you know, my, my, my light pads and,
you know, I need to start, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: hyper, you know, going into flower
overdrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of those things are basically
telling the plant like, Hey, you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to get, you need to get on it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I do think that there's a lot
of those techniques that can lead to much
[SPEAKER_01]: larger harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a step back and thinking about
everything that has to do with growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other advice do you have for those
who are looking to maximize yield and or
[SPEAKER_00]: quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I mean, you know, I think with
growing, uh, you know, a lot of times it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, I think largely people
tend to overthink the growing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they, they, they try to get
almost a little bit too nitpicky on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's something that,
you know, I think that you need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, use your intuition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you need to kind of pay attention
to what the plants are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pay attention to the little
signals that they're giving you,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, and adjust accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, again, you do in order to
use some of these stress techniques,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do have to have a healthy base first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has, that goes back to,
uh, you know, what we've been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, which is, you know, the correct
balance between lighting, CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: EC and water content and CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, if you have all of those
things in harmony and working together,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can go in and to do all of those
little stress techniques with UV,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, with water suppression,
with, you know, stripping of leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, at week three of flower, like all
those little things would the plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: react great because it's now in a healthy
state where it's like, I can handle that
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the production that I'm going
to put out as a result of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you don't have a healthy base to
start with, you're just going to ruin your
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to, you're
basically going to, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to throw the plant over the
edge, uh, and you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased yields and you're going to have
poor quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, you know, it's really
concentrating on getting that healthy base
[SPEAKER_01]: first, then starting to incorporate some
of those stress techniques, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is really probably what I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really good advice
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could the listeners find you and what
do you love coming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, you can find me on
basically, um, all of our YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channels, uh, grow strong industries,
Gorilla Grow, Kind LED grow lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: Lotus Nutrients, uh, and Super Ponics,
um, or Super Closet, um, all have their
[SPEAKER_01]: individual social channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, all have individual YouTube channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to consolidate everything
onto grow strong industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and we've got some great
products, uh, you know, in the pipeline
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out, probably none of which I'm at
liberty to talk about quite yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but if you keep an eye on
our websites, um, then, uh, you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing them come out here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, we're just going to continue
doing what we've always done, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is try to, you know, make
world-class products that answer to those
[SPEAKER_01]: pain points, um, that growers have and,
uh, continue making it easier and easier
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to have access to plant
medicine and to grow their own,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, because, you know, it's not only
fun, but it's, you know, super rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and at the end of the day,
everybody should be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody should be able to grow
their own plant medicine and the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables that they put on their table
for dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as a humanity, we need to get back
to our connection with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's a great way to do it,
you know, watching that plant go through
[SPEAKER_01]: all of its processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's a labor of love being
able to see it go through those processes
[SPEAKER_01]: and harvest it and consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, there's nothing, there's nothing
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, you know, helping people kind
of get back to that, uh, is, is our main
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw on social media recently,
you guys announced a, was it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: signature grow tent with like Tommy Chong
or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just launched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just launched.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a little while in the making.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, Tommy's team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reached out to us and wanted to partner on
a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously, you know,
Tommy Chong has been an integral part of
[SPEAKER_01]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, he's been a pioneer in a lot
of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you know, he has been
fighting for that same thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: accent people having, uh, you know,
free access to plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we've always supported
Tommy and his, uh, his mission in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's funny as hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, it was a pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Project to work on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're pretty excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's certainly a legend in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually had him on, uh,
another podcast I'm on called from the
[SPEAKER_00]: stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He came on there and he was sitting there
and he's telling all these stories and
[SPEAKER_00]: boy, can he talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he's, he's such a classic guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, super nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I mean, it's just
everything that comes out of his mouth is
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a, just, just, just a sweet,
sweet guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your channel, probably I'll put,
probably put the grow strong industries
[SPEAKER_00]: one down in the YouTube description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're tuning in on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for them either
[SPEAKER_00]: grow strong industries or gorilla grow
tent, Lotus nutrients, kind LED,
