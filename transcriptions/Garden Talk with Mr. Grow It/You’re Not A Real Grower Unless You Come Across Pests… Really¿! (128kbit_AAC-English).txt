[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into pests next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with IPM, things you could do
to prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do in that case?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had problems with pests and I had a
bad bag of cocoa in the past that I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with fungus nets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get rid of that, I had to use
mosquito bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something that I had to water into the
cocoa every day for at least about a week
[SPEAKER_01]: till I got rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I normally keep sticky traps around
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always a good monitor just to
keep an eye on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to stop you from getting
them, but it's going to tell you if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a problem or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus nets are such a pain, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I battle them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to come and go so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can certainly be frustrating when you
have a crazy outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like they have been too
crazy for you, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across any major pest
infestations, whether it be spider mice,
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, anything like that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just the fungus net, luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they say you're not a real grower
until you get spider mites and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I'm not a real grower yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard somebody say that at the grow shop
the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I guess I'm not a real grower yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess agree to disagree on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who have been growing for
five plus years and they've never come
[SPEAKER_00]: across pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to call them not a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that you haven't come
across any major infestations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be such a pain, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had aphids outdoors one time and it was
so disheartening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on actually my bok choy and I went
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was harvest day and I was like,
oh, go on and harvest some bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time growing it, I was super
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was purple lady bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like completely purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to go harvest it and I'm
just loaded with aphids, kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: borrowed in and it was disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh no, how the heck am I going
to eat this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things about growing
outside is you can't really control too
[SPEAKER_01]: much what's going on out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors is a whole different battlefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you doing anything as a
preventative, like sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use sprays, particularly
like in the veg stage in order to deter
[SPEAKER_00]: pests or prevent pests from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do those at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had to yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know everybody's telling me to
go ahead and just get some preventative
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance going on before it happens,
but I haven't had the chance to experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: with any different type of sprays yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm always wanting to try something.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep my fingers crossed that you
don't come across any infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hope for the best on that avenue.
