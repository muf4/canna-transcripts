[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro sent me over their FC3000 LED
grow light and in this video I am going to
[SPEAKER_00]: unbox the unit, I'm going to test the
power output and I'm going to do a heat
[SPEAKER_00]: test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all the specs
that this grow light has but I will leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link down in the description section
below so you can click on that if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn more about this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay first thing out the box is the
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that you can see they have included
a sheet of stickers, here is the meanwhile
[SPEAKER_00]: driver, as you can see they already have
pieces attached to it so all you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is place onto the fixture and then
tighten the screws to secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've included a set of rope ratchet
hangers, here's the power cord,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cable, and the user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 extended range power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'm going to set it to
100% so it's operating at full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these power tests just to give you a
general idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls that will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coverage area for this grow light is 4
feet by 4 feet for veg and 3 feet by 3
[SPEAKER_00]: feet for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements in a 4 foot
by 4 foot grow tent and I'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements at 3 different distances,
12 inches, 18 inches, and 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 18 inches and 24 inches are veg
recommended height distances I'll move my
[SPEAKER_00]: power meter around the entire footprint
and then for the 12 inch measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: which are recommended for the flowering
stage I'll keep my power meter in a 3 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: by 3 foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plug the LED grow light into my kilowatt
meter and it shows 2.48 amps pulling 295
[SPEAKER_00]: watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below and I've also included a
coupon code down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
