[SPEAKER_01]: Two girls ago, I had severe like newt
lockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't figure what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was showing all these different signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was chasing my tail for what felt
like ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go, I think new things come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I find the only way I'm
learning from them is to have it happen
[SPEAKER_01]: and to experience it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, OK, this is this is
what's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, in the future,
once you see that sign or symptom again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, oh, my God, I've seen this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just chill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Read my pH in my medium was way off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, it's something I should
have been doing more often or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: more frequent because it would have solved
my issue right away when you do it
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and master what you've got going
on or or fix one of your issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Garden Talk, episode seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode's guest goes by the name
Zerp84.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an indoor gardener that has been
growing plants for a little over three
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we talk about his style
of growing and what he does to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful in his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also learn about some of the mistakes
that he's done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentioned several things that will
help beginner gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: This information may be especially helpful
for those of you who are brand new to
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening or who just have a few years
under your belt.

[SPEAKER_00]: and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, let's just get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Zerp84.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking for a little while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been over a year now since we've been
kind of going back and forth through DMS
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we've been we've chatted
through messages for probably about a
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But way back when I started and I was
pretty new to this, I was actually very
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised because you I asked some
questions to you early on in the game for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you responded super quickly,
which I wasn't expecting because I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you're who you are in this space
right now is fresh and new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't expecting it to happen,
but I really appreciated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you answered a lot of questions
for me in my early stages of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so for those that don't know who you
are, can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I go by Zerp84, obviously on YouTube
and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first and foremost, I am a father of
three little boys and a husband who still
[SPEAKER_01]: works a full time career with the Canadian
military.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my time is consumed mostly by that and
my children.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my spare time and my favorite hobby is
to grow plants, obviously, which is why
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on this show with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into growing roughly three years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was a kid and teenager and a
skateboarder, I did smoke a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I joined the military at an early age
at 16, so obviously I couldn't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout my career in the military.
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently in Canada, about two to three
years ago, it was legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even in the forces you're allowed to
use or to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have like multiple injuries just
throughout my body from being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: military for so long and also some mental
health stuff going on too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they legalized it, I hopped back
into it because I knew the benefits that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could provide just for injuries and for
mental health and personally the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: growing experience itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very therapeutic for me too,
let alone the product at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: which seems to help with my mental health
issues even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I hopped back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, you're allowed to grow four
plants legally per household.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through the whole process of
applying to get a license to the ACNPR
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I obviously got a license to grow more
than that just to help me with what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: got going on and for my wife as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, here we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in a small tent in my garage right
now since they legalized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I sleep like a baby now and it's
helped a lot of other things for me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't be happier that it's been
legalized up here and that we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow it and consume it while in the force
is still up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you also have a YouTube channel,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I kind of know about you is you
launched a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you asked me for advice or DMs
at some point and checked out your
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have some good videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you like to explain things a
little bit in detail about your style of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have a little character on
the side there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The macho man, pot girl man, pot girl man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I like to, I mean, that's fun too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I like to make the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I don't have a lot of followers
or subscribers, but I mean, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good to pass on knowledge that I'm
learning from you, from other growers in
[SPEAKER_01]: the space that have been around for a
while and just put it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause whoever watches it is looking for
information and looking for tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a way to make it easier for
them, then I mean, it's beneficial for
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my alter ego kind of got me going at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, uh, I just thought it was funny,
a little play on words and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the character I use as my,
um, my profile pic on Instagram being
[SPEAKER_01]: Paco, man, it's just, you know,
it's a, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a throwback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just recently, uh, talked with,
uh, welcome to the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you know who he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has, uh, like a Ric flair.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes up to woo personality in his
videos and on his live stream and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we need to link up a pot girl man
with, uh, Ric flair gets you guys in on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you're a small home
grower at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you just have one tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, what would you consider like
your goal is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like go for yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow a variety of different strains
or, or, or what is your style or goals
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably, I mean, everybody would
like to, to start a goal with the end goal
[SPEAKER_01]: of being a huge yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, but for me, uh, the goal is
just to be self-sufficient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, to provide, I guess,
medicine for myself, um, without having to
[SPEAKER_01]: pay a ridiculous price from a government
store to get it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just remaining self-sufficient and not
having to spend money on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, like I said, the actual process
of it and the habit of growing is
[SPEAKER_01]: therapeutic as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal is to just have a,
hopefully a stress free, minimize the
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and just have a, from start to
finish, a good grow and provide myself
[SPEAKER_01]: with a couple of months of product to get
me through to the next growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably save a bunch of money doing it
that way, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, it taught quite a bit from the
government stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, since they regulated it,
it's, I mean, they can charge what they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to charge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's expensive to go to one of those
stores and actually purchase from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely, uh, ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, every household can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, I mean, if, if you're using or
smoking, it saves a lot of money if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to grow it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything that you do in order
to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't had too many issues with
pests, but I do use the sticky paper and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have come into a problem of mites at one
point, which I was scrambling because I
[SPEAKER_01]: had nothing on hand to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I simply just ordered a, like an
organic spray, obviously not to damage or
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce anything foreign to the,
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have to do anything with pests
either to try and get rid of the mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: which seemed to handle it pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I can't remember the name of it
offhand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just, I just quickly searched it,
uh, online and bought it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just, just the fact that it was
organic and it's in, it dealt with the
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, the issue I was having being
mites and it did the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the only two things I've
really done for pest control and simply
[SPEAKER_01]: because I had to, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I, I, yeah, I've only experienced
mites once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just, uh, yeah, the flies get bad
in the summer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put the sticky paper down and it gets
rid of them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far were the mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you catch them like in the veg stage
or were you in the flower state?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you talk about spider mites,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was actually away with the military
and my, my wife passed the information on
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little more, it's harder for me
to grow too, because whenever there's an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue, like I'm away, I was away a lot,
uh, probably half of each month or close
[SPEAKER_01]: to half of each month I was away in my
last job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, so a lot of the issues fell on
her, which obviously I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I love her and appreciate everything she
does because she, she holds it down when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gone, but she recognized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just the fact that she's, she noticed
a web in the upper part of one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when she looked a little closer,
it was in multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously they have, they had gone,
like progressed pretty bad because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were moving to all the plants and the webs
were getting big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she, she let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I would say it was probably early
on in flower when she noticed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, it obviously, this, this spray and
whatever they were doing to the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, stunted to grow quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the end yield obviously was affected,
but she realized it.
[SPEAKER_01]: She passed the info on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I were the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: She sprayed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think after it took a little while,
uh, she cut a lot of the, the dead veg off
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and, uh, sprayed them a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think within probably a week to two
weeks she had it sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that, that timeframe really,
really hurt the girl, but I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was still salvageable and still got
some stuff out of it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good that you were able to
salvage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know generally it's recommended not to
spray in the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you were able to still do it and
be able to salvage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good to hear for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're in a, you said you were in a
small grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size grow tent are you in and what
light do you currently have running?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a five by five right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five by five.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a, um, an SP 3000 and a TS
3000, both by Mars, uh, in there right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually just sent me the 60,
the SP 6,500, which is very similar to the
[SPEAKER_00]: SP 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but there are some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they hit you up and talk
to you about that one yet, cause I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sponsored by them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sponsored by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I like overall, I've been growing
with their lights now for probably about a
[SPEAKER_01]: year and I, I can't complain, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, what they're giving me is,
is great products and, and the outcome has
[SPEAKER_01]: been, uh, good as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no issues yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your five by five, how many plants
do you typically run and what size grow
[SPEAKER_00]: pots do you typically use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I kind of go back and forth between
autos and photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five by five, if I was running photos,
I'd probably, I'd have probably four in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, four or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for the photos actually to,
to, to start off for photos and autos,
[SPEAKER_01]: I germ in solo cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I had the space and the ability to
put them in their permanent, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: pots as autos, obviously I would,
so that I wouldn't, I would have to cause
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of stress or less stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transplant in the right for autos because
of the lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I start off in solos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I go to three gallons for the photos
and then I'll transplant again from three
[SPEAKER_01]: to either five or bigger, depending on
what time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm, if I'm going to put any
outside, but for the tent, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't go bigger than five just
to save space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can move around there with them and
give them the space they need as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for autos from solo cups,
I just put them into three gallons and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, and that's where they, where they
stay for the rest of the girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for, like I said, for photos,
I'll probably put five in there for the
[SPEAKER_01]: five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I have for autos,
I have eight in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you primarily use the plastic pots,
fabric pots, air pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from solos and I go, I have both
actually, and it kind of depending on if
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just finished a girl and I'm going to
new pots, just kind of availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've cleaned them out well enough,
if there's still medium left in them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I use, uh, fabric and plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, right now my girls are, uh,
the current girl was all in plastic,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, I do prefer fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just the fact that I, uh,
I had obviously just harvested a crop and
[SPEAKER_01]: still had a bunch of stuff left in the
fabrics and wanted to get these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: back into pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I threw them into three gallon plastics
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said you also do outdoor growing
too, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants do you typically run
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for outdoors, I only had the four last
year and I had those in a 10 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bigger pot size, bigger plant,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had them in 10 gallon fabrics outside
and it's, uh, they actually did really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco coir?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in your mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in soil and currently I run a,
uh, pro mix HP, micro is a, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: with probably about 80% and then 20% of
the medium I make up just of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's grow for worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, but prior to that I was,
uh, I was in about probably 20% farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10% worm castings and then, uh,
70%, uh, neutral plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do you use for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a diff, a few different
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently I'm using general hydroponics,
uh, with their, um, grow bloom micro as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as their cool bloom for flower and,
um, and their Cal Mag as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I also have some bud juice,
like dry or nitro to throw in on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, uh, like the, and, and mix it
in, uh, if there's any nitro deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, and that's it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your initial mix of the, um,
pro mix and then the compost, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: your particular mix, how long does that
last you until you actually need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding those nutrients in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just, uh, pHed water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use pHed water for, I guess,
depending on autos and photos,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, pHed water for, I'll say autos
for probably the first three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I started, started adding the
nutrients slowly, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually don't even give the
recommended dose of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually give half of what they
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I found obviously early on in growing,
I was given what I recommended and having
[SPEAKER_01]: more issues than I, than I seem to,
uh, run into now, but, uh, I find just
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them half of the recommended doses
has been working great for me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously adding the cool bloom
or whatever, whatever bud booster or
[SPEAKER_01]: flower booster you want to add at the end
of your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started doing in, uh, probably the
last month of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you are using their, uh,
feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going by their feeding chart,
but you're doing a half dose instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like an every other do water and
then feed the next time around and then
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then feed the next time around,
which is kind of a common practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll, I'll water it out, like get it
obviously so that it's, uh, the whole pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the medium gets moist, uh,
just pHed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap water is what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every second feeding,
I'll add nutrients to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does your tap water that you used,
do you have to let it dechlorinate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know every area is kind of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some areas have chlorine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have chloramine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, does your local water have that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you let it like have to let it sit
out or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, right out of the tap, I,
um, fill up my, uh, my container and add
[SPEAKER_01]: my nutrients and just pH it right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I usually, uh, usually out of the tap
after the nutrients are added,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sitting at about seven per pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bring it down to like 5.8,
5.96 in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I've had no issues so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty new to this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just moved here about six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so far, so good with the tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so are you just pH adjusting your
nutrients and then giving to your plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you also monitor the pH of like the
runoff or a slurry test or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, or, or just going in?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it sounds terrible, but the only
time I really pH runoff is if I'm actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have an issue that I, that I see or an
issue arises and I'm like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: And two girls ago I had severe like newt,
newt lockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't figure what was going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying all these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was showing all these different signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was chasing my tail for what felt
like ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I finally pHed my runoff,
I realized that my pH in my medium was way
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, obviously it's something I should
have been doing more often or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: more frequent because it would have solved
my issue right away and, uh, probably
[SPEAKER_01]: salvaged more of that grow for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I do every so often now check it
not necessarily when there's an issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, not as frequent, frequent as I
should.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably one of the biggest
lessons I've learned in growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I read a lot of material,
obviously, but, uh, I don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to, to like read all this material
and, and process it and pull out all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm more of a trial by fire type of
learner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I find like if you've messed
something up that that's been going on for
[SPEAKER_01]: a month or two, or you've ruined to grow
or whatever this or that it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it leaves a lasting
impression and you won't make that same
[SPEAKER_01]: mistake again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, it's kinda how I've been
rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and the newt lockout was a major one
because I had a beautiful girl going in
[SPEAKER_01]: and it just destroyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took me, I want to say weeks to
figure what was going on, but it was the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH in the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had I tested the runoff early on,
I would have been aware of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, yeah, you live and you learn and
I won't make the same mistake again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I have an issue now, it's one of
the first things I checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, so the Cal Mag, do you feed Cal
Mag every time or do you do go along with
[SPEAKER_00]: every other and mix it in with the
nutrients, the bit, the base nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to just feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I recognize an issue, uh,
but recently in the last two girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing it every second feeding,
like you said, so we water in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every time I actually give
nutrients, I give it a little bit of Cal
[SPEAKER_01]: Mag as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I don't give same thing,
not even near the recommended dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: not even half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually give like a quarter of what it's
recommending just so it's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it's, I don't wait for
deficient's easier way to see anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: any signs of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I give it a little bit with every,
with every feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What brand Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with general hydroponics for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about like P, P M or EC values?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you monitor those at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I know we were chatting earlier
about it, but, uh, I don't really monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: PPMs anymore and no specific reason other
than I don't have a meter right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was reading it and checking it
frequently, but, uh, my meter went down
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not doing it as of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for EC, I have never checked it or
monitored it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and obviously, and actually didn't
even really know what it was until
[SPEAKER_01]: recently, recently when I did some
research on it, just because you,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you had touched on it with me
previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so no, I don't monitor EC or PPM right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I should do because I do run CO2
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're mostly just kind of reading the
plant, seeing how the plant looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you said you've got several
years experience now, so you kind of know
[SPEAKER_00]: what to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're kind of going by that in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reading the plant and, um, and like,
and reading the medium as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, not as often as I said, like it
should, like I said, but, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it just through experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very early on here and still an
amateur in my eyes, because there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much to learn and you can always improve.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, just, just looking at the
plant, looking for, for signs of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things is kind of how I've been rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been working so far for the last
row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you go, I think new things come up
and really, I find the only way I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: learning from them is, is to have it
happen and to experience it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're like, okay, this is,
this is what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's going to look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, in the future,
once you see that sign or symptom again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, Oh my God, I've seen this
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that experience problems or
treasures.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you could go through each grow without
an issue and never have to chase your
[SPEAKER_01]: tail, never have to fix anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, please tell me how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, the best way to learn is by
doing it and experiencing all the things
[SPEAKER_01]: these, these things can throw at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in every different strain is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to show different signs of
different things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, you kind of get used to knowing
what you're looking for, what the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: are telling you what I mean, if limp
branches, whatever, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about additives and microbial
inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you use the liquid cool bloom for
an additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use anything else for an additive?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you use any microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually, you know, I guess I just
add the, the cool bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been debating for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess kind of a different topic,
but along the same lines, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: debating for a while and I was switching
to an organic bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously with the dry amendments,
I still haven't pulled the trigger on it
[SPEAKER_01]: because I watch a lot of growers and I
envy them and I want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know once you get it dialed in,
it can be quite easy, but getting it
[SPEAKER_01]: dialed in is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that I go away all the time
and a lot of the problems fall into my
[SPEAKER_01]: wife's hands and she's busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still haven't switched, but I want to
make the switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get back on topic, I don't know a
microbe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm not, I'm not using them at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going organics, you know, some of the best
advice I've ever got was plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of need to plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, you're a particular situation
when you're, you know, always traveling or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be difficult to kind of go that
route, but you can certainly get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you were planning on going
the, the blend, like I know Gaia Green is
[SPEAKER_00]: big up in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gaia Green has a blend, a couple blends
that you can mix in together and then
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially added some microbes on top of
that, or so there's different amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, planning ahead is,
is a big piece of it because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those organic amendments need time to
break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start to see deficiencies,
well, it's not like you can just top dress
[SPEAKER_00]: in and expect a quick recovery time like
you can with, with bottled nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the plant available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be tricky, but yeah,
when you're ready, man, push, push
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to, to go that organic route.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what you see in Reed, when,
when things are going well organically,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I mean, just you've got your
amendments in there and you're adding pH
[SPEAKER_01]: water for however many weeks until you
need to re-up on your amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when things start going sour,
they're really sour and it takes a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit to get it back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, yeah, if I'm, if I'm home for
an extended period of time, which this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this new position I'm in, I may be,
I may make the switch and give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've mentioned a little bit about
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do use CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly, what method do you use of
CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I simply use the TNB CO2 enhancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't explored the actual bottle like
buying or filling your own CO2 bottles and
[SPEAKER_01]: having it disperse on a meter or,
or the actual exhale bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used the TNB CO2 enhancer and simply
because I'm sponsored by them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they send me bottles and the,
and I use it and it's, and the ease of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's, it's no cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I honestly, I tell everybody that
asked me about it because in my first few
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, I wasn't introducing CO2 at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but once I started using it,
I noticed changes in my grows personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I, I suggest it to everybody and
not, not, not because I'm sponsored,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because of the benefits you get at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you hang it above the plants or what do
you put it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have it hanging almost at the
level of my lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so when it disperses, it obviously
drops down into the canopy of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, I mean, without an actual field
grow environment too, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and the zippers and vents and stuff in
your tents, I don't know how much of it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually escaping because I don't have a
BPM reader for, for the CO2 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's obviously providing
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it probably provide more benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a better environment or was
tracking the PPMs in there, but it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: providing enough that I noticed changes in
my growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the same TMB naturals canisters as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a huge box a while back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was actually pretty cool that
they sent that over to me, but I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: trying, I've been using them just cause I,
you know, I have them and I know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper methods of CO2 home remedy methods
that you can do for, for much cheaper than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exhale bags are arguably, a cheaper
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hung it above my plants as well as
put it like on the floor of the grow tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: like around the, around the oscillating
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another recommendation by TMB
naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a CO2 monitor and I have in the
past monitored the PPM and I also do
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a sealed environment,
which like you had mentioned, isn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely effective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much better to be in a sealed
environment, sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, the PPM levels I've monitored
just kind of, but checking on my tent
[SPEAKER_00]: randomly, it's really gotten up to a
thousand, 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually, you know, it's shown to
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's with exhausting randomly as
the heat kind of goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the AC infinity fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it reaches like 82, I think I'd
have it set at 82 Fahrenheit, it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it will turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's coming on intermittently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the CO2 is kind of being sucked out
intermittently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had good success with them as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did have the, when I was checking
PPMs and I was in a four by four tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was sitting somewhere around a
thousand as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with intermittent exhausting,
cause the same thing I have an AC infinity
[SPEAKER_01]: that it comes on when it goes over 27
Celsius that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically like to run for a
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically like to run for
humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, depending on the stage that
they're in, for obviously seedlings,
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually keep it up between 65,
70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in seedlings, I don't have a way
to track the heat other than they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting on a heat mat in a dome until they
get put into the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until they get put into the tent,
they're sitting between 65, 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're large enough to go
into the tent, obviously the dome comes
[SPEAKER_01]: off and they go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it to stay around 25 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they're in the tent, usually
between 50, 55% humidity, which is all
[SPEAKER_01]: tracked and it fluctuates right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My tent, because I'm in Canada,
it is cold outside and my tent is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously the temperature fluctuates with
whatever is doing outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're sitting on concrete,
not directly on concrete.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, obviously have them elevated in
the tent, but so it'll go, it'll go
[SPEAKER_01]: between 22 to 28.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have heaters in there as well as
humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so it'll, it'll go up and down
as the exhausts and the heaters kick in
[SPEAKER_01]: and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ideally I'd like it to sit around 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, it moves probably between
22, 23, all the way up to 28, which
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes beneficial too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running CO2, you can run higher
temperatures as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I mean, it works both ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like it to stay steady,
but it's, I mean, it doesn't stay steady
[SPEAKER_01]: in its natural environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's mimicking its natural
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes up and down as, as the weather
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pretty automated as far as
controlling your temp and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like, um, now do you have like a
monitor for VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you chase after a VPD or anything like
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just kind of, I'm currently just,
uh, I just have a one of Inkbird's
[SPEAKER_01]: controllers, uh, just for heat and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, like I said, I have the
humidifier, uh, obviously the AC infinity
[SPEAKER_01]: hooked up to it as well as, uh,
a heater in the tent because of how cold
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets at night here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, they just kick on and off with
the parameters that I've set in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to maintain and hold it
pretty well where I want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling you earlier that like,
there's a lot of storms where I'm at
[SPEAKER_01]: because I am on a mountain here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the power does go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess pretty frequently, maybe once
every couple of weeks or once a month or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, just from the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find myself chasing my tail or,
or, uh, moving plants in and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: environments to keep them warm through the
night or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the great thing about obviously
monitoring them as well and having the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the apps on your phone is right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's an issue and you're not home,
you know, you know what's going on and you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to, you need to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super, super helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I miss the part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you said what you usually
run for in flowering, what you run for
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's always chances like bud
rot happening, especially during the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your humidity is too high and you have
that stagnant air and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you run a lower humidity in flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you said that or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower, I like to stay around and both
about 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I've, I've got multiple
circulating fans in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one, one pot level, uh, blowing air,
like oscillating fan blowing air across
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of the pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then others that are hitting the
canopy as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I'm in there, even though I have
all these things tracking it and
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring it, I'm, I have a habit,
like I'm obsessed with going in the tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't ideal either if you're running
in CO2, but I'm always in and out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent checking on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, I look for moisture on the
sides of the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look for moisture on the, on the
anything, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if, and if I find it, then obviously
I'm opening things up or are cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: things down or venting it out or,
but yeah, 50% is where I like to be during
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems to be working so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Key point that you just mentioned is you
have multiple oscillating fans,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I actually had one oscillating fan
in the tent and this is on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's a seed to harvest grow series
that I did is, uh, I ended up getting bud
[SPEAKER_00]: rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause one of my fans died overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lack of airflow, it's
definitely going to, to grow to spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's so key.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you had mentioned is multiple sources
of air circulation with the oscillating
[SPEAKER_00]: fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you just fed them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just fed them and your medium is
wet throughout the plant, and then all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden you lose a fan or say the power,
anything power goes out, a fan goes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: craps out on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're just sitting there with
no air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll go in there and you're tense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hours later, it's something that
obviously I, I suggest having multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: fans, but I guess the, the, uh,
the counter to that is what the,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the multiple fans in there is the
medium dries out so quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so medium and with the heater in the,
in the tent as well up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a heater going multiple fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find my medium is dry with,
well, I mean, in the stage I'm in right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, which is late flower with my autos
and they're, they're eating everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gives them anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with the fans moving around in the
heater, uh, my medium is dry and two,
[SPEAKER_01]: three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a live, live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it definitely, um, can struggle
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried doing any mulch layers at
all to kind of help with the retention,
[SPEAKER_00]: water retention in the medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, uh, I've kind of been exploring
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't pulled the trigger yet,
but I've been exploring the like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, top dressing it with clover or
something like that, just, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well to try and keep dampness in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, haven't done it yet, but,
uh, I think I'm going to in the next role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you'll like it ever since I
switched to clover and even I use barley
[SPEAKER_00]: straws, a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has helped me tremendously as far as
making sure that medium doesn't dry out
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you usually do for plant
training for plant training?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I don't really go too deep into
plant training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I, when I'm running photos,
obviously I top trying to get like as wide
[SPEAKER_01]: a canopy as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and, and obviously, and I'm,
and I do LST and tie branches down to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to try and create as many top sites or
even canopy with, with multiple top site
[SPEAKER_01]: as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for my autos, same thing,
just LST, just tying them down,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to get it to grow, uh, equally
throughout and as many top cycle as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as, as I can get, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I don't go too crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for the most part, I, I tend to let
them do what they're going to do or even
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat be the structure they're going to
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I top it a few times to create some
more, uh, bud sites, then so be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, I generally let them go
and, and yeah, top them a few times and
[SPEAKER_01]: LST.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are trying to maintain that even
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever used a trellis netting and
doesn't like the Scrog technique or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used, uh, trellis netting in the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't currently have one now cause
I, my trellis net, I had it cut down to my
[SPEAKER_01]: four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wouldn't stretch out to my five by
five, but, uh, and right now it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I didn't need to, to use it,
but, uh, I'll get back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My next one, I'm going to be moving to,
uh, photos again and hopefully,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, hopefully have five or six of them in
the eight by four that I should be
[SPEAKER_01]: receiving soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and my goal in that one is to get
the most even widespread canopies as I can
[SPEAKER_01]: to try and fill up that tent with,
with five, maybe five or six plants in an
[SPEAKER_01]: eight by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see what we can do and see if we
can fill it up and get as many top sites
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that is my goal for the next
row is to try and master, uh, the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be recording footage and
putting it onto your channel?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely link Zurp84's channel down
in the description section below so you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys can check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a few more questions for you before we
end this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I have a lot of beginners that are
listening to this podcast, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that are subscribers to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to ask all the guests,
you know, what advice do you have for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's just starting growing for
the first time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just chill and relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like there's, there's so many
tidbits of information all over the place
[SPEAKER_01]: or what you should do or how you can do
this or how you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the main or the key things
taken care of being like medium pH levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, humidity and temperature, I mean,
no grow is going to go smooth for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, there's going to be issues
with each girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get, I, I would say, um,
I mean, you can get through a girl with
[SPEAKER_01]: minimal issues or you can be like,
wow, that's a good girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was not too much happening there,
but there's going to be issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just chill, take your time,
uh, read, read material that's going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to provide you with the
information you need to, to solve the
[SPEAKER_01]: problems that you run into and just be
prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause things are going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to react.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's lots of people out there
in this space to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's so good about this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is everybody is here for the same reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, don't be scared to reach out,
ask questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause people will get back to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the people in this space have
a good grasp of what they're doing and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll provide you with the information you
need to get through your girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you already mentioned you have a
YouTube channel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you all saw on Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other platforms that you're
on that, that the listeners can,
[SPEAKER_00]: can find you on?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just, yeah, currently YouTube and
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, very small following on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I mean, I, I don't, I don't have
the ability to pump out videos like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people in the space do just,
just because of work in my, in my family
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, YouTube, Instagram,
I have, uh, a little bit of a better
[SPEAKER_01]: following on Instagram and post a lot more
pictures simply because you can snap
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures pretty easily and just throw them
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, Instagram, YouTube,
um, I am sponsored by Mars and TNB,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't a hard thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're new to this space and you're
putting good content out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, uh, there's people around watching
what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link your Instagram down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you have upcoming?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you're, you're going
upgrading a little bit to a four by eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to need a couple more
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got upcoming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah, I'm hopefully having a tent show
up here in the next couple of weeks from
[SPEAKER_01]: Mars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's an eight by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know light wise what I'm going
to throw in there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get it set up and kind of see
how things play out or like how they lay
[SPEAKER_01]: out in there with the, with that
structure, with the two lights that I
[SPEAKER_01]: currently have running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be moving to photos this time
with a couple of different, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't quite selected what genetics I'm
going to run yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few in my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have too many seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a habit of buying seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, still haven't really picked what I
want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to probably do three or four
different screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, it's, it's coming and all photos
and like, I said, my main goal is to work
[SPEAKER_01]: on the canopy and try and maximize,
uh, the bud sites I get out of these five
[SPEAKER_01]: or six plants that I, that I choose to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'll be documenting that one as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, hopefully you guys can check that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will definitely be tuned into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any final words, anything before we end
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate you having me on here,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you reached out to me, I was,
I was surprised because I've looked up to
[SPEAKER_01]: you and like you said, DMD for advice in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you having me on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for people growing or new to the
space, just enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find the process of growing itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therapeutic it's, uh, enjoy it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, even the mistakes, the mistakes and
the issues are better, um, teaching points
[SPEAKER_01]: than, than probably what you're going to
find out of a book because you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're learning from somebody else's
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do it yourself and master what
you've got going on or, or fix one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, it's so rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, and you'll probably never make the
same mistake again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just chill, relax and have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great way to end it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zerp, thank you so much for coming onto my
channel and, uh, yeah, enjoy the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
