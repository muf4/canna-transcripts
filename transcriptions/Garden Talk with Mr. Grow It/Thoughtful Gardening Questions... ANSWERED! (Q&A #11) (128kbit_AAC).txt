[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried the peanut butter breath
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how did you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually really like peanut butter
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually got, I was gifted from THC
Titan from Square One Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually started his line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if a lot of people know this,
but he actually started his line with
[SPEAKER_00]: peanut butter breath cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it was a cut he started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ended up making it into an F2,
and then he took that F2 and started his
[SPEAKER_00]: line, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get him on the podcast sometime
and go through his story there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got his F2s that he created of
peanut butter breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up getting one that changed color
to purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dig back, you can see beautiful
plant, real dense all the way down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a cultivar that there's that
density down even in the lower part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might not do all the lollipopping
that you should have done, but those lower
[SPEAKER_00]: buds are still really dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all cultivars do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's select cultivars that do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the smoke, it was a
very chill narcotic effect, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend peanut butter
breath.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did enjoy that cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thought on using molasses
during flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's nothing against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, feeding in the microbes,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: My thoughts on using molasses as far as
frequency, I personally like to just use
[SPEAKER_00]: it only in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it throughout the grow,
used it every other week, used it once a
[SPEAKER_00]: month, used it every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just generally speaking, like my own
observations, it seems like if I start the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on molasses young, the plant looks
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after the feeding, the plant's
praying up towards the light, beautiful,
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly healthy, clearly happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually that kind of goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you use it too early in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I personally like to use it
in flower mostly, even all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: through flush, through that flush period
and all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant seemed stuck in time, was growing
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the leaves got darker and the leaves
grew smaller than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What could it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many different
variables on it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrition, if you're using synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things I ask folks that
are asking for help is what is the pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes folks will do a runoff test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they run water through the medium,
collect the runoff water, and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: their pH probe in there or their TDS
tester to get a PPM measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that can tell you quite a bit
sometimes it might be that the pH is out
[SPEAKER_00]: of range and you're not getting the proper
nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be stunting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have overwatered, it might not
be, you know, lacks of oxygen in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could stun growth, not enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are many different things that it
could potentially be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had more information on kind of what
you're using for, you know, nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting, like distance, pH, PPM,
runoff measurements, I might be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a better answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First autos, when would you say top dress
in happy frog with worm casting rice halls
[SPEAKER_00]: on top?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to assume you're using some type
of blend at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings rice hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be something more than just
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming, at least there should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that there's some type
of blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what they'll do is, you know,
a lot of folks will have their initial
[SPEAKER_00]: blend of the medium with the nutrients in
about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the grow, depending on the plant
size, depending on the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: container, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of variables, but generally
speaking about day 30 or day 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll top dress again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people go as early as day 20 top
dress again, then flip to flower and then
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do another top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on if you've cut,
uh, you know, if you're going to eight
[SPEAKER_00]: week, nine week, 10 week cultivar,
or one of the cultivars that are longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than that, you might want to do another
top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much generally speaking,
every 30 days, roughly some people do
[SPEAKER_00]: every 20 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do every 40 days, depending on
what blend you're using, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But roughly every 30 days is, is when a
top dressing should happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the lowest wattage to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hundred Watts is what a lot of
people get in the way with a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights that are for a two foot by two
foot growth space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just putting a hundred Watts of
LED over that and they're able to get away
[SPEAKER_00]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size grow space you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a larger grow space,
then more Watts are warranted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're roughly four to 500 Watts of LED
in a four by four space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are just some rough numbers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long before you start feeding with Fox
farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Fox farm trio, I'm assuming you're
talking about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you started with an amended soil,
typically you can get a roughly 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30, sometimes 40 days out of that amended
soil, depending on what size grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in, and then at that point you would
start feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually what I'll do is I'll check the
runoff measurement, PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something will go after EC though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll track that instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go by the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say go by the ratios because they
formulate their nutrients with a
[SPEAKER_00]: particular balance in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an imbalance of nutrients in
your medium, more of one nutrient,
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough of another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could cause a lockout to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, check out their feeding chart
around 30, 40 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably when you'll do your first
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have an update on the AC infinity
pole fan?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still not available.
[SPEAKER_00]: No issues so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running four of them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I run two in each one of my tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a two by four and a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main issue with those
oscillating fans that clip onto the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tents from other brands is the fact that
they had their wiring run through the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual, it's a case through the actual
piece that connects to the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the fan was oscillating,
the wire was just rubbing up against the
[SPEAKER_00]: side and it was shortening it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why you hear about people who
like their tents have gotten on fire and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of the design.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now AC infinity, they're fans that clip to
the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are actually the wires like off
to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't even go through the actual
casing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still working great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was somebody who actually there
was several people who complained about
[SPEAKER_00]: the light on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That light actually turns off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just on temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it ends up turning off after
like, I don't know, five or eight seconds
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do some girls claim a Fox star motion
force burns seedlings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never experienced that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get minor burns sometimes some
cultivars, but it's not really detrimental
[SPEAKER_00]: to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had one plant that I can remember
that was detrimental to where it just
[SPEAKER_00]: looked like nitrogen toxicity and the
leaves were just terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have it on my channel,
my main channel somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys go back to the sour diesel,
this had to have been said to have been
[SPEAKER_00]: like three years ago, roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The phenol just couldn't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sour diesel, my experience and
from what I hear from a lot of people is
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a very sensitive phenol when it
comes to feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finicky, you're going to get some
genetics just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I use Fox farm ocean forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it for over 10 years and I
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on a way to make
edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do the oil or the butter,
mostly oil done in a crock pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of letting it soak in the crock pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the recipe memorized or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I usually do oil and then use
that within the edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in one of your talks with Dr.
Bugby, you discuss using green light
[SPEAKER_00]: during the later phase of flowering should
increase trichome reduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you refresh my memory on the
specifics?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green light is something that's used,
but you usually hear of UVB as the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that increases trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what Dr. Bugby had said is that there
are some studies around it, but it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember the exact word,
but something like inclusive, meaning that
[SPEAKER_00]: they couldn't say for sure that it did
increase trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody else had replied in the comments
and said that there's some other study out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but he didn't post a link.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure if there is
actually another study or somebody just
[SPEAKER_00]: saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you grown hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: DWC, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern, and I have a Garden Talk
podcast episode with somebody who does DWC
[SPEAKER_00]: and our DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern was that I live in too hot of a
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water temperature needs to be controlled
and needs to be under, don't quote me on
[SPEAKER_00]: this, I think under like 75 degrees
Fahrenheit and my natural just regular
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature can be 75 to 80.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just have a feeling that I'm going to
struggle when it comes to water temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know I can get a chiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: My concern is that's more energy and me
just being a small home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't seem like it's worth it,
but I do want to try it in the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: time, one of these times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any good tips for welcome to the grow
temp?
[SPEAKER_00]: PFG, purple frost giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat of a heavy feeder in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be too conservative when it comes
to nutrients, particularly I'm talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about precision feeding with bottled
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You might do a little bit more than a half
dose, generally speaking, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: what nutrient line you're using,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've found that I've been able to give
more than just a half dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been times where I gave a full
dose, particularly in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch the feeding and might be a hungry
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what generation the PFG is,
but I assume there's going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: variation in feedings, depending on
feeding type as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heavy feeder, in my opinion,
on the two that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we hear the OG four by four face?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I say four foot by four foot,
people think I say weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that really sound weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my accent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from Boston and I kind of
have the accent a little bit on some
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went away a lot, but four foot by four
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that sounds weird to some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give any advice on auto pots,
dos and don'ts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had the best luck with doing
or organics and auto pots, and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people out there that'll say, oh,
everything's been fine for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me personally, top dressing nutrients
and using the auto pots didn't really work
[SPEAKER_00]: out well in my expectations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If using synthetics, it'll probably be a
little bit easier for you because the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, it's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's waking up from the bottom,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not doing any top watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that top layer moist where the
amendments are for organics and breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: was difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's even having a mulch layer on
top of it, even having a cover crop on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of it to try to help with water retention
and keep that top layer moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't recommend using auto pots,
organics with auto pots, but some people
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetics should be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The copper disc, make sure you're using
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure it's inside the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people actually got away with
putting it outside the pot, like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: in the, the bin below or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sure the roots don't grow
out from the bottom and clog up your auto
[SPEAKER_00]: pod that's happened before to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been using Auro water, but costs may
become an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I remove the chlorine from tap
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auro, you must be going out and buying
Auro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider getting a one friend to the sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have the space for it
or not, but I have it under my kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: sink and I have the, just basically have
one gallon containers that I pump it into,
[SPEAKER_00]: but some people will do a five gallon
bucket and then they're just put into a
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon bucket, but removing chlorine
from tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's chlorine and not
chloramine, make sure it's chlorine first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often folks just let it sit out 24 hours,
48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having sunlight on it will help speed up
that process for the chlorine to
[SPEAKER_00]: dissipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a lot of people just let that,
let it sit out for 24 to 48 hours and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the chlorine is removed from the tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I recommend that you get a water
report and have somebody take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: that to see if there's any other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the soil doctor, for example,
is somebody who I recommend that you take
[SPEAKER_00]: your water report to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think going through Logan labs,
you might want to actually send a water
[SPEAKER_00]: sample to Logan labs, have them test to
get the result, then talk to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor and he can give you some really
good information about if there's any sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of contaminants in there that's going to
impact your plant or he can actually tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you what type of like what you'll need in
your nutrients as far as elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of tap waters have a lot of
calcium in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a nutrient solution,
you won't need as much calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: As one example, but yeah, just let it sit
out for 24, 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's typically what people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use silica throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe to use throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many benefits for silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now short answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use silica throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does freak show have a traditional skunky
smell or something different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you know, it's more of like,
uh, at least the cultivar I have is more
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a lemony type smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, uh, moving the freak show for one,
10, 20 minutes to another and I had it
[SPEAKER_00]: like all over my arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was flopping all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are just, they're so heavy that
they're flopping all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I had it all over my arms and I'm
just like smelling myself and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely more of a lemony,
at least for the phenose that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feed the whole time with auto pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume you're talking about with
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really hard to give you that answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each nutrient line is going to be
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I've been able to do like a
quarter dose of nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, each cultivar seems to
be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each phenotype is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could get different results as far
as like the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're feeding nutrients from one
reservoir, going to multiple phenotypes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could see different there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been times where I've shut off
the valve, let the plants kind of dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes just add in water, top feed
water for one or two times, then turn that
[SPEAKER_00]: valve back on for the auto pots going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing you might want to
consider if you feel like you are
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially over-fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I transplant from roots organic soil
to Foxfarm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're talking about like
starting in a one gallon container,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, or solo cup of roots organic,
and then going into a new container that
[SPEAKER_00]: has Foxfarm in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I hope you're not talking about is
like starting in a one gallon container
[SPEAKER_00]: with roots organic, taking that plant out,
shaking off all the medium, breaking up
[SPEAKER_00]: all the roots, getting rid of that medium,
then going to Foxfarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there's any need to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people go from soil to cocoa
that way, and the plant was not happy at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't recommend that, but you can
absolutely go from roots organic to
[SPEAKER_00]: Foxfarm or vice versa, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you completely move on from earth dust
nutrient line?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a bunch of earth dust
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan to use them in my outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been really liking the Kraft
Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I only have so many plants,
so nothing against earth dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely took me a while to get used to
it and learn what that guy was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish there was more instruction back
when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I got the hang of it,
yeah, things were dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does a pH go up over time with cocoa,
unlike soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say because it really depends
on what else is in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for amendments, for example,
what are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolomite lime is one of the things that
drifts it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have dolomite lime in there,
it'll definitely drift up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is going to really release
acids in order to control the pH a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your pH is too high, the plant will
actually release acids into that
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will lower the pH, particularly to grab
some of the elements that aren't available
[SPEAKER_00]: at that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is a good example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.5 pH or lower is typically where iron
can be uptaken by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the pH is higher than that,
it's going to send out acids to lower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's able to grab that iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cocoa coir in particular is known for
a high cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about cation exchange capacity
is basically think of it like a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people explain it as you've got
your piece of media cocoa and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: all these particles that can stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so cation exchange capacity is just
like the capacity it has, the ability it
[SPEAKER_00]: has to stick to those particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear about how cocoa, a lot of people
have to go heavy on the calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it has a high cocoa is a high
cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going to stick to it that
calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why a lot of people will buffer
cocoa with Cal Mag prior to planting in
[SPEAKER_00]: it, rinsing, rinsing and buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as does it go pH go up over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it does if you're checking the
runoff pH, but I found it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: impact the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally go for a 5.8 pH of the
nutrient solution going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ignore runoff pH for cocoa
because yeah, you know, when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started planting in it, what went in for
pH is what measured it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, over time, what went in it,
I got a number that was way up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I read online, did my own
research and people say, ignore it,
[SPEAKER_00]: ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants looking fine,
you're putting that 5.8 pH going in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I've stuck with
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching.
