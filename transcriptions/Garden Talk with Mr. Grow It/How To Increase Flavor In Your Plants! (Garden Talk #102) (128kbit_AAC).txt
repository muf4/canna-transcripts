[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 102.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Tim
McCormick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 12 years and is
the owner of Culture Biologics,
[SPEAKER_01]: a company that formulates and manufactures
an organic product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim has an extensive background in
horticulture, everything from chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology, plant physiology,
soil science, entomology, and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually Tim's second time on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was on episode 41, where he talked all
about grow science versus grow science.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks all about
increasing the flavor that plants produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are various things that you can do
to plants when growing them to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: their flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim gets into all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring free gardening
information of all plants to the general
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now have humidifiers called the
CloudForge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the CloudForge T3,
which has a 4.5 liter capacity and can be
[SPEAKER_01]: filled from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also includes a hose, so you can place
the humidifier outside your grow tent and
[SPEAKER_01]: feed the hose into your grow tent,
saving you precious space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also connects to the Controller 69 Pro,
so you can control it from your
[SPEAKER_01]: smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: their humidifiers and the discount code
MRGROWAT15 works on both Amazon and their
[SPEAKER_01]: website, acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Tim McCormick.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your second time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an episode all the way back in
episode 41, Bro Science versus Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: Science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just looking today at the number of
views, over 85,000 views on that episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was definitely one of the top episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was a lot of stuff in
that video that you justâ€”a lot of Bro
[SPEAKER_01]: Science that you had to dismiss there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just talked to a guy named Joe today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, hey, I was watching your
video on Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to message you and just talk to you
about the stuff you guys talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still get traction from it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great episode, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so much good, valuable information
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you decided to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: For another time around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a real hot topic for you again
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to bring out flavor within plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like 10 plus years ago,
it was all about yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are looking to do things
differently to the plant in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the yield, but there wasn't as
much focus on flavor as there is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more people we talk to, how do I
increase the flavor in my plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I increase the smell in my plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Less talk about yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we're going to get into a
lot of different things within the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: that impact flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_01]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Tim McCormick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the president and formulator of
Culture Biologics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a unique fertilizer and biopesticide
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really started off into doing microbes
and putting our growth technology into the
[SPEAKER_00]: microformulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, we've just launched our new
nutrient technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all about innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all about customers first,
growers first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a grower that made fertilizers for
other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about the culture for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about everybody looking out for
each other and just trying to grow the
[SPEAKER_00]: best plants possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting into flavor, I feel like we need
to start with the basics, although it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get advanced pretty quickly here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us, what is the source of the
flavor that we get when consuming these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oil inside these trichomes,
these glands, is a lot of what's reacting
[SPEAKER_00]: to your taste buds and your palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many things that go into
producing actual flavor, what your palate
[SPEAKER_00]: is reacting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these phenolic compounds,
the flavor of the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have mono-, di-, tri-, sesquiterpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all grains from small flavor
molecules to large flavor molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those even will turn into flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have esters and thiol compounds,
like the skunk smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a multitude of compounds that are
within the plant, contained within the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and even the plant tissue itself,
that all lead up to what the flavor is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sap content is a lot of where all these
compounds will reside, like the fluid
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you burn the flower or when you're
tasting all these molecules inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit or vegetables or what have you,
it's a range of compounds that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is biochemically producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant, from the time that it grows
from a seed to the time that you pick the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit or harvest the plant, it's a
biochemical machine that is constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: taking metals and ions and other simple
molecules and turning them into these
[SPEAKER_00]: complex things that we call the taste and
the smells and the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are various things that are said
that impact the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go through a list of things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can lighting impact the terpenes that are
produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to think about what a terpene
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the aromatics of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do plants produce these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants produce them to ward away other
animals, other creatures that might want
[SPEAKER_00]: to infest the plant, eat the plant,
consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can act as an attractant to other
insects and other animals and other bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: to come eat it so it can digest the seed
and deposit the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene itself is a phenolic compound
that the plant produces inside the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: These oil glands are what we call
secondary metabolites of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant produces resin and trichomes as
a self-defense mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any bugs that are trying to walk through
the plant to eat the plant, they'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: trapped up in the resin, stuck,
and they can't move, they can't really
[SPEAKER_00]: feed, they can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environment, specifically the
lighting, impacts the formation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: resin gland and what's inside the resin
gland.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get down to the resin gland itself,
it's a sphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfectly designed sphere so it can
take in the UV radiation from the sun and
[SPEAKER_00]: diffract it and break it apart so the UV
radiation doesn't touch the plant tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: because UV radiation is harmful to every
living organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants produce secondary metabolites like
trichome resin glands to help protect
[SPEAKER_00]: itself from UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, lighting can absolutely
impact the terpenes being produced,
[SPEAKER_00]: the active compounds inside these resin
glands, the flavonoids Any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: compound inside these resin glands can be
directly impacted from the lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, which is why you see certain UV
contents to indoor lighting because you
[SPEAKER_00]: need the UV radiation to signal to the
plant that I need to produce trichomes so
[SPEAKER_00]: I can form a barrier between me and the UV
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes with the terpenes themselves
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Besides UV, can any of the other spectrums
of light impact the specific terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have any control over that,
like limonene, mercy, and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there spectrums of light that trigger
those specific types of terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see a lot of difference
between LED lights and CMH to HPS and the
[SPEAKER_00]: different resin output.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have people put the far reds in their
LED diodes to help trigger the plant into
[SPEAKER_00]: producing more chemicals inside the oil
gland, trigger specific biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grown outside get a completely
different spectrum of light from the
[SPEAKER_00]: colors to the UV radiation to everything
in between that really affects the
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that the plants biochemically
make.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe that the photons and
all the different spectrums outside cause
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to biochemically create
different terpenes than you would inside,
[SPEAKER_00]: different active compounds outside
compared to inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the color goes into it,
the UV radiation goes into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the infrared goes into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything regarding the light really goes
into the production of all these active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that the plants are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about some of the environment
conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, outdoors, temperature,
humidity, CO2, you don't have any control
[SPEAKER_01]: over that, but for the indoor growers,
they're doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're changing the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're changing the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CO2 levels, they're adjusting all that
in order to try to get a better flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can any of those environmental conditions
impact the terpenes that are produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your CO2 level that the plant takes in is
part of its ability to photosynthesize,
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to take compounds from photons,
convert them into sugars and pass those
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your airflow is extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your humidity levels, the amount of
moisture that the plant can transpire at
[SPEAKER_00]: one time will dictate the amount of
nutrients being taken up, which will
[SPEAKER_00]: dictate the chemo profile or the chemo
type of the plant, which is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: different mixtures of compounds that the
plant takes up over time inside your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is going to dictate what the
end result is going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything down to your CO2,
to your air exchange, to the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: photon the lights are going to put out are
eventually going to create a different
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemical effect and result inside the
plant, probably more so indoors because
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to act like God and you have to
fine tune all the little different details
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything, whereas nature itself has
been evolving millions and millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: years to provide the perfect condition for
plants to grow and to mature in different
[SPEAKER_00]: latitudes and longitudes and just
generally how the plant's going to develop
[SPEAKER_00]: and evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, indoors it's so much more fine
tuned and you can really see how much of
[SPEAKER_00]: an impact just even your CO2 levels will
have, your PAR readings will have,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much water the plant takes up
throughout the life cycle because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen and oxygen content that the
plant's going to turn into other molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: that have hydrogens and oxygens into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so for temperature, humidity and
CO2, is there a specific temperature that
[SPEAKER_01]: you tell people to aim for and humidity
that you tell them to aim for and then CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: levels that you tell people to aim for in
order to get the most terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of it comes down to
environmental conditions that are
[SPEAKER_00]: favorable for the plant just to do it and
actually does.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are aiding in the process of
these plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we can't really control much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control your environment and then
you put a plant there and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: react to whatever the variables that the
environment gets to and that's where your
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical expressions come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody talks about phenotypes this,
phenotypes that, I mean, you really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get down to the phenotypes and like
what the plant expresses, like what
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes it produces is all dependent on
what your environment is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In different environments, you can take
the same cultivar and just put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different environment and the plant will
produce more limonene or a plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more citrine or the plant will
produce more myrcine or beta carafyline,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the only thing you changed
was the lighting, the CO2 and the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of it and it will completely give
you a different flavor profile or even
[SPEAKER_00]: just a slightly different profile and just
give you a very slight different
[SPEAKER_00]: expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the beauty of it,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all growers and we are all kind of
building these rooms and then kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a part of your soul goes into it and then
you can see what you did and how the
[SPEAKER_00]: living organism responds to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my eyes, that's like the coolest part
of growing is being the curator of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I like to keep my temperatures
pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it depending on, you know,
your lights are going to, your photon
[SPEAKER_00]: output is going to tell you where to put
your temperatures and where you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put your CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to directly answer your question,
you know, you have people 1200,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1400 part per million of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambient CO2 outside is about 400 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: These people start at 700 in veg and go up
to 1200, 1400 and flower to keep up with
[SPEAKER_00]: the photosynthesis rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: These output usually have more efficient
photon usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants getting a better spread
of photons across the board and for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: hitting the plant and photon nutrition
goes into elemental nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're going to, so your LEDs,
they're going to be pushing the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: its maximum growth rate is going to
require higher temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to require more CO2 and it's
going to require more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are going to, you know,
purple stem on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't keep up with the nutrient
load, the energy is going to be used up
[SPEAKER_00]: taking care of the photons hitting the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, humidity too dry,
the plant's going to suffer too moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to grow mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to, I like to stick between the
40 to 60% range as far as humidity goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this factor really goes down to the
type of cultivar you're growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: variety, because those are going to,
some come from dry areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some come from, very wet tropical areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really depends on what you're
growing as far as the type of environment
[SPEAKER_00]: and the type of lights, humidity,
whatever you're going to be throwing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's going to biochemically take
that and create that into its own profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going right down the line of
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to get into that one next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched upon it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's more and more people going
towards the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's people who swear that if
you're given the plant an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer, organic regiment, it's going
to create a better terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other side, you've got people who
are using synthetics that are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, the organics break down to the same
exact molecule and then the plant's up
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the fertilizer impact terpenes at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a very deep rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody hang on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go from a very macro
perspective of this and then we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to dive deep into each of the synthetics,
what it's doing for the plant and the
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, what it's doing for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molecules break down to molecules,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like the simplest form,
but ratios are important and the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule is important and nitrogen is not
just nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just generally speaking, when it comes
to plant nutrition, your elements that you
[SPEAKER_00]: give the plant are going to be what the
plant turns into enzymes that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: create all these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have your micronutrient profile,
believe it or not, is going to be a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important factor into what the plant
creates because manganese and magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: are both used in the process to make
phenolic compounds, to make terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids and even active compounds
inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything down to the elements that
you are using is going to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: different...
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to give you a different
terpene output, a different flavonoid
[SPEAKER_00]: output, a different even antioxidant
output in blueberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all of these elements are what
allows the plant to biochemically turn
[SPEAKER_00]: into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just macro view 20,000 feet,
your nutrient profiles that you use are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a direct impact on the
flavor and the terpenes that the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you get down to it though,
making sure you have the right blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrient blend to macro blend to
secondary element blend is really
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you have these improper
proportions of micronutrients and the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer is more CalMac because magnesium
can supplement to the plant a function
[SPEAKER_00]: that manganese does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these elements, you have to
have things in the proper balance first
[SPEAKER_00]: and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondarily, nitrogenous salts are
probably the plight to getting flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a high nitrate load,
high urea, high ammonia, the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have to increase the water
content and water load so much inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that it's going to dilute out the
sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we see with like forage,
for example, like alfalfa, the first chop
[SPEAKER_00]: is always the best when you grow alfalfa
from seed and that's because the plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: the sap, doesn't need all the extra
nutrients that we put after you cut it the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time for like the second crop for it
to grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we find that when you start applying
nitrogenous salts, like nitrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: like urea, ammonium nitrate, the plant's
water load goes up a ton and what ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: happening is that all the sap,
which contains all the flavor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which contains all your total dissolved
solids, is going to get diluted out with
[SPEAKER_00]: water now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, molecules break down to molecules,
but when you start pumping nitrates into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, the plant's water load
increases to the point where any flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: you did have is getting washed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting washed out now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why you see a lot of
hydronutrients produce crops that taste
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar because we rely on our carbo
loads, we rely on our sweeteners to give
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant a form of carbon to kind of
catch the bricks level up for the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of water load going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi State did a really cool study
on forage and their first cut,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't put any application of
nitrogenous salts down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bricks level is about 12%,
which is deep, which is good for like
[SPEAKER_00]: grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the one application of ammonium
nitrate, it dropped from 12% to 7%,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bricks level did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because we're diluting out the
sap content, the total dissolved solids of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant with the increased nitrogenous
salts bringing the water load up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that like you're using
chemicals and the chemicals are causing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to produce a bad flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that we're just increasing the water
load to the point where once we dry it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just diluted out all of our flavor
molecules to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at organic growing,
so it's like the synthetic rabbit hole,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, is in order to get the potassium,
the phosphorus, all these microelements,
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium into the plant, we need to
increase, everything is attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate molecule, which brings a ton of
water with it, which more nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: more water, so technically just diluting
everything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the organic side of things,
you don't have nitrogenous salts the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you do these synthetic fertilizers or
these salt-based fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your nitrogenous salts are wrapped up in
guanos, is wrapped up in blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's carbon, there's other molecules
that are attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just a free load of nitrates
just getting pushed into your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrates are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ammonia is important for the plant to
produce into different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant functions and lives off
nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, hell, the lightning hitting the
sky and taking the water molecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting electrolysis takes the oxygen
in the sky and the nitrogen in the sky,
[SPEAKER_00]: combines it in the nitrates, and the
nitrates rain down on us all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why after a rain, you see the
plants start growing really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because they just got showered with
light amounts of nitrates, because
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates are part of nature and they're
part of our society.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem though, and this is why
organic soil-grown ultimately is more
[SPEAKER_00]: flavorful, is because we don't have the
amount of nitrates getting pushed into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant has more bricks, more sap
content, and that's where all the flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where all your phenolic compounds
are that are going to get turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: active compounds or terpenes or flavonoids
or esters or stiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all are retained within the sap of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest difference between
soil-grown and, say, soil-grown is the
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate load and polluting out the flavor
that the plant naturally has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned sap, you mentioned
bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a lot of beginners that tune
into this podcast, and they might not be
[SPEAKER_01]: aware of what you're talking about sap,
bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that, and how do you measure it,
and how does that really relate to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor?
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if there's anything else to
be said about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a common practice to look at the
bricks level inside of a plant for the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to go for yields, and that's
usually where we get to with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because your bricks level isn't going to
tell you what your yields are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's usually a trade-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: High bricks usually means lower-yielding
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bricks itself is essentially the total
dissolved solids of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting calcium, we're putting
different minerals, different ions into
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is going to have different
amino acids and proteins and lipids and
[SPEAKER_00]: tannins and phenolic compounds that get
turned into terpenes and other active
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those are loaded within the sap of
the plant, the fluid of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the blood in humans is like the sap
inside plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so naturally, if humans have thin
blood, or if we have blood that is low in
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, or if something's wrong with our
blood, something is very wrong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: human body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where if our sap level is thinned out,
or your total dissolved solids is lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than where it should be, that's where
plants are going to start getting attacked
[SPEAKER_00]: by pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the plants are going to
start getting picked out and itemized by
[SPEAKER_00]: the different insects that are migrating
throughout the year or growing in that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bricks test is a test that we use
to see ourselves where the total dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: solid level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a positive correlation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have higher total dissolved solids,
you have a higher bricks content,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means the plant has more molecules
inside of itself to protect itself from
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, from different insects itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests don't prefer the plants with a high
bricks level because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: antimicrobials and compounds that are not
attractive to the insects itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure the health of the plant
based on the bricks level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In agriculture, we will use this on grapes
to see what the sugar content is,
[SPEAKER_00]: because dissolved sugar inside the sap is
one of the contents that we measure inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the bricks test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we measure fruits and vegetables with
bricks testing to see where the sugar
[SPEAKER_00]: level's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wine, making wine, they're huge into
bricks testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forage, to measure how much nutrients is
in the grass that we feed the cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a bricks test for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really telling us how many
molecules are in the plant at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And higher water content means lower
nutrient, which means the nutrient density
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the plant is at a lower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that tells us we need to adjust
what we're feeding the plant to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the bricks level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So simply put, it's just a measurement
that we can just tell the general overall
[SPEAKER_00]: health and dissolve solids within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the sap is the fluid that we can
taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about a hot house tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a tomato that's the fleshy,
light red, very watery tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bricks test on that is going to be way
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why tomatoes taste like water
now, because we grow them with nitrogenous
[SPEAKER_00]: salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a nice, organic-grown
tomato, it's deep red, and it has acidity
[SPEAKER_00]: to it, and it has flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And real tomatoes taste like a fruit,
and not like a watery, fleshy,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaty vegetable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that the plants that
we are growing hydroponically in our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry are having a higher bricks
content compared to having a higher EC
[SPEAKER_00]: content inside the medium, or inside the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a practice that we don't see a lot
of inside the hydroponic industry that we
[SPEAKER_00]: should see a lot more of, because that's
ultimately what's going to tell us where
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor's at at the end of the plant's
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've heard about bricks and how it
relates to pests, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that if it's 12% or greater,
pests won't attack the plant as it would
[SPEAKER_01]: with a plant with lower bricks levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't know bricks actually also
relates to the terpene content in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you need a bricks refractometer in
order to actually do the measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get that online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Amazon can get a cheap one for
like 20 bucks, or you can get a digital
[SPEAKER_01]: one for, I think it's like 150-ish bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those digital ones are really cool,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think all people should be having
one of those and testing the plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great tool to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a grower, we should have every tool
we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have pH probes that go into our
soil that tell us the pH of our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have EC probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have pH meters for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should have every tool we can possibly
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the digital ones for
refractometers, especially when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to plant, like plant matter, and not fruit
or vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're measuring plant matter,
I like the digital ones because they're a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better at reading compared to
your eyes seeing it refracting,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the sugars and things refracting
inside the scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how often should they be doing a
bricks test?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if they take a test today,
for example, then do a change within that
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, when's an appropriate time to do
the next test?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best way I look at it is we want to
use this as part of our eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're taking soil slurries or
measuring runoff, and that's your eyes for
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to have your eyes for what's
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to tell you how many
terpenes you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to tell you how many
calciums you have or how many sugars you
[SPEAKER_00]: have inside your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to give you a vision of
overall plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're going through stressful
times, it's just helpful to see where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's at and its general health.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the digital ones, specifically for
plant matter, because it's still more
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate as far as what's in the plant
itself, and you don't have to use your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more so, it's really hard to squeeze
plant matter and get the juice out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually have like, you only need like
a drop or two of the sap of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually take like a garlic press and
just pack it in there and just squeeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like one or two drops goes on the
digital reader, and it just tells you
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately what it is, zero guesswork.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hannah makes a great instrument for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, along with the type of instrument,
you also want to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using the proper part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plants are always changing,
they're always evolving, they're always
[SPEAKER_00]: developing further.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do once a week, kind of just
test on my bricks just to see where the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can usually see a deficiency before
it happens by measuring the bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: just because the plant will start to
utilize its reserves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll tell you, kind of like a quick tip
before the plant starts to show speckling
[SPEAKER_00]: or a plant starts to show yellowing in the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, once a week works,
once every other week also works,
[SPEAKER_00]: just the plant changes so fast so often
that you just want to have just a frequent
[SPEAKER_00]: and like it takes two seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a leaf or take a petiole,
which is probably the better place to take
[SPEAKER_00]: the sample from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then press it and get a drop or two
out and let the reading tell you where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to work back to the fertilizer
question, because I have a follow up
[SPEAKER_01]: question on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's going to be some people in
the comments who are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: distraught.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's a good word for it,
hearing that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, my question is, how do
consumers kind of avoid the bad
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something that they can look on
the back of the bottle and they could see
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, this includes this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is going to be a harmful form
of nitrogen that Tim had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do they establish what's
good and what's bad as far as fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at the back label and look at
the nitrate load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the guaranteed analysis and look at
how much of the nitrogen is nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: derived?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of the urea derived?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of it is ammonia derived?
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer carbon based nitrogen,
which is protein nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need a source of nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's in your soil with like what
you amend it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to add nitrates on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best way if you're looking at
bottled fertilizer is look at your nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look if they're using any amino acids or
if they're using any type of protein
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondarily, look for ingredients that are
natural, that are carbon derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest factors on the plant
producing terpenes and other carbon based
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules is the amount of carbon you're
feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with organic soils, you can have humus
and compost and worm castings in there
[SPEAKER_00]: that are constantly leaching carbon for
the plant to take up and to turn into your
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and flavonoids and active
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing is making sure you're
not just using salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure there's some type of carbon
form in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see everything derived from
nitrate, phosphates, EDTA micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a high water load to
getting into your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't call it bad fertilizers per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would mostly just put them in a specific
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're conventional fertilizers and
they're going to do what conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: products do, which is create a high
biomass, but a low bricks content,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means you're going to yield really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to taste like cardboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all going to taste like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like growing tomatoes in soil
compared to growing tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponically with some of these bad
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your tomatoes grown hydroponically with
these salt blends are going to come out
[SPEAKER_00]: very bland in flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we see bad tomatoes everywhere
now because they're all grown with salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you grow a tomato with
organic soil, with amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: with carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have the acidity increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have all the antioxidants
increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have all the active
molecules inside any of the fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables are going to go off the chart
by using ingredients that are more carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see rock phosphate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times these rock phosphates are
good because they slowly leach phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil, which allows the
microorganisms to start feeding on the
[SPEAKER_00]: rock phosphate and the microorganisms will
start exuding all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon based molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we just use salts to grow plants,
the plant doesn't have any carbon to use
[SPEAKER_00]: to convert into terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your terpene synthesis, your pathway
goes from mono terpenes all the way over
[SPEAKER_00]: to sesquiterpenes, small to large terpene
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant only has a certain amount of
carbon, it's going to make it into small
[SPEAKER_00]: lightweight molecules and you're not going
to have the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant with the carbon load is going
to be able to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short is tend to tailor away
from nitrate based fertilizer systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at the back of the
label, just go with the low nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that means you're going to be top
dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually that means you're going to be
using protein based nitrogen, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to start making that change now
compared to continue producing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: crop with the same flavor as everybody
else and not be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrates are good for producing biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrates are not good for producing a
BRICS content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of that Mississippi State
study that I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did three applications of urea ammonium
nitrate as one control, ammonium nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: as another control and then just left the
crop by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went with every application of a
nitrogen assault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went from 12% BRICS content,
which is good, down to 7%, down to 6%,
[SPEAKER_00]: down to a low 6% by the third application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut your BRICS level in half,
but your yield almost doubled compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really it's what you're going for,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to have a hard time with the bad
fertilizer thing because it's not bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to give you a specific
result and we should just go into it
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing that we're going to get a
lackluster crop in the end, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a lot out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, you make me think because I did
learn a little bit about terpenes in
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Utah State University,
just their online program for their
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation certificates under Dr. Bruce
Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a video on terpene synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I learned about the five carbon
building block terpene and then you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 carbon building block and 15 carbon
building block, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just mentioned those.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I learned is that what you just said
is that these fertilizer programs are
[SPEAKER_01]: building just five carbon, they're mostly
going to build a five carbon building
[SPEAKER_01]: block right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are more volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're more likely to lose those than
the 10 or the 15 carbon block terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have all the memorized which
ones are which, you know, what's Limoni,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's Mercy and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just got me thinking a little bit
if the fertilizer, if the Solpe fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're using is causing the plant to
create more five carbon building block
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, well then you more chance of
losing them, particularly during like
[SPEAKER_01]: drying, curing, storing and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still continuing medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a year ago that I've had cured up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just because our carbon based
nutrients give massive amounts of very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small forms of carbon that the plant
can use to turn into those 15 carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: building blocks for the terpenes or for
the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mind you, it will go from the small
terpenes to large terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the same pathway all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it goes to flavonoids and then it
goes to more complex esters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's this daisy chain effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the plant is deficient on carbon,
the plant is only going to use whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon it can to create small molecules
and not give you the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of these other molecules,
like these longer 15 carbon chain
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that really goes to show like
what nutrients can really do in the
[SPEAKER_00]: production of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another study out there showing
the relationship between magnesium and
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese and how the plant produced more
developed, more longer chain terpenes was
[SPEAKER_00]: just the addition of magnesium to the
manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of goes to show that like
whatever the biochemical process making
[SPEAKER_00]: all these terpenes and flavonoids inside
the plant, it really, really does depend
[SPEAKER_00]: on the nutrient content that the plant
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the balance of micronutrients to
secondary elements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how much carbon content does the
plant have to take up and to use as
[SPEAKER_00]: precursors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really comes down to, I think,
what you're giving the plant for it to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to create in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you giving it nitrates that are going
to be really good for biomass creation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not going to give the plant very
much as far as like terpene synthesis or
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoid or any of these other active
molecule antioxidant compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it really comes down to you get
out what you put in type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I learned so much on this one and
just connecting the dots on a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more things that certainly
can impact terpenes that I want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbiology, I've heard that the
microbes in the soil can actually impact
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, is there a specific consortium
of microbes that impact the flavor of
[SPEAKER_01]: certain terpenes being produced?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say all microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the really cool part about
microbes is they really exude purely
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon-based molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: All their enzymes, carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of their organic acids, carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetic acid, acetobacter bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Acetic acid is extremely important as a
simple acid for the plant to turn into all
[SPEAKER_00]: of its biological molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carboxylic acids are what the plant will
release from the root system to go find
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once these carboxylic acids or root
exudates match up with these elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sends a flag saying, hey, I'm one of
yours and the plant can take it up at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria and fungi even break down
molecules, consume them, wrap them into
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon and excrete them out into a
carbon-based molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really why all of these
microorganisms throughout the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenously inside the soil and the ones
we're using will have an impact on the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor produced inside the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember who did it, but there was
a study, I'll have to find it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll send it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really cool study on grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're making wines out of,
I think it's in Chile, and they're making
[SPEAKER_00]: wines out of two different soil,
two or three different regions of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they ended up doing is taking these
regions of soil, growing a crop in it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes that are thriving,
and they took the same soil and they nuked
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They completely killed any consortia and
then made a sterile soil out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bricks level in the grapes,
when they measured the sugar content,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was like half the sugar content the
normal grapes were.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, they had way less tannins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had way less, the whole spectrum of
molecules completely changed within the
[SPEAKER_00]: grape plant, all because they sterilized
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would even go into saying that the
soil profile itself is really important
[SPEAKER_00]: because grapes grown in France is
different than grapes grown in Chile,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Chile grapes are different than the
ones in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see that not only does the
complex, the elements inside the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: matter, but what really, really comes down
to is the spectrum of microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: inside the soil, because that's what
produces all the carbon-based molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: around the root system that the plant's
going to take up and to turn into all
[SPEAKER_00]: these flavors and all these dissolved
solids within the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbes play, I would say,
just as big a role as the elements you put
[SPEAKER_00]: into the plant as far as how the flavor
profile is going to come out and the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene production is going to come out
and the sugar content is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: produced inside the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on the bottled
microbial inoculants that are being sold
[SPEAKER_01]: that are kind of, a lot of them are
limited in the diversity versus if you go
[SPEAKER_01]: out to your backyard, do the IMO process,
you can get so much more diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think the more diverse complex of
microorganisms you have, the more complex
[SPEAKER_00]: the aromas and the flavors are going to
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that goes into active
compound synthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making all the favorite compounds we
have in our medicinal plants and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: antioxidants and the blueberries and
things that keep us healthy, really come
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the consortia of bacteria and
fungi and archaea and nematodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, protozoa and all the organisms
that are part of their food chain that
[SPEAKER_00]: they all eat each other and cycle through
inside the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of those really go down to
getting the plant access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, it's about what you get out,
what you put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those little machines, those little
microbes are giving the plant a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of consortia of organic molecules,
carbon-based molecules that the plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: take up and synthesize into whatever they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why an inoculated crop,
whether it's a bottle or whether you use
[SPEAKER_00]: indigenous soils, they're always going to
produce a better flavor crop than using a
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilizing agent like Cleanze all the
time and just constantly nuking
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has no available organic
compounds to synthesize as a precursor
[SPEAKER_00]: into these flavors, into the sugars,
into the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a lot of the bottles of inoculants
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're always going to get a
better profile inside an indigenous soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and just curating that indigenous soil
with other carbon-based ingredients,
[SPEAKER_00]: prebiotics, plant proteins, animal
proteins, things that can wake up the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to have a way better
consortia of organic compounds around your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with all those microbes breeding
and growing like crazy compared to a
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized Athena-based crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They push sterility in your grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to just use their salt
blends and keep everything sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is completely ignorant to
what nature does and how nature has
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved over the years because plants are
supposed to have endophytes and ecophytic
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria around the root systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to have a mycorrhizae
relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're supposed to be rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the soils that the mycorrhizae can
latch onto and consume and directly inject
[SPEAKER_00]: the phosphorus into the root system of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a bottled consortia of these
microorganisms is way better than no
[SPEAKER_00]: consortia at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relating to what you had said,
the mycorrhizal network down in the medium
[SPEAKER_01]: companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into that because that is
said to actually have an impact on terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing strawberries next to a
medicinal plant, some say that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially get a terpene profile similar
to strawberries in that medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's something to say for root
exudates and different plants talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and sharing nutrition and
organic molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think other plants will also attract a
different consortia of microbiology around
[SPEAKER_00]: the different rhizospheres of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain crops will have a certain natural,
like beans having a natural legume,
[SPEAKER_00]: loving bacteria, azotobacter bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legumes promote nitrogen fixation
microbes, cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think plants naturally will want to
interact with each other inside an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start putting different plants
together, I think naturally they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to share and they're going to be different
than them by themselves.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more things I want to get
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we could talk about this topic for
hours if we really wanted to, but ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: storage conditions in order to conserve
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not storing it in the proper
conditions, like I mentioned a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, these terpenes can volatize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can lose them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go into your grow room and you're
smelling, those are terpenes volatizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storage side of things I think is often
overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of folks on drying,
proper drying conditions, curing,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the right moisture content,
but storage, a lot of people I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: neglect, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're losing a lot of that terpene
profile, just volatizing away.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the ideal storage condition in
order to conserve terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and the rest of the state, probably
four state area on this side of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States, the Colorado, Arizona,
New Mexico, Utah area, even Nevada,
[SPEAKER_00]: we struggle with having any humidity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're lucky to get 30% humidity most days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good storage conditions is about
60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing is the UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: UV is very, very, very good at breaking
apart molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually clear jars stuck out in the
sunlight are going to volatilize terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: way faster than anything else,
way faster than heat, way faster than
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient, arid environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of it, what you need to do
is keep it in a cool, dark place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you cure it or once you dry it to a
certain extent, making sure that it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sealed container.
[SPEAKER_00]: No plastic, plastic leaches so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plastic is petro-based molecules,
it's carbon-based molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these terpenes are going to evaporate
and purge through the plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic is your enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like amber glass, personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep my stuff in a drawer or in
a tote and just keep them in a cool dry
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find us through our Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys have a profile, you can come
out to our Discord and come chat with us
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of really good literature
that's based on that our products are
[SPEAKER_00]: based on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I post all our literature there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really good community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do giveaways there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a discount code for our Discord
users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally just a place where we can all
talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very active on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to atcul.tur.ed on Instagram
and you can come find us and talk to us
[SPEAKER_00]: and see all the cool things we're up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing a lot of product videos,
how-tos, showing people how these powders
[SPEAKER_00]: dissolve into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our YouTube also, youtube.com backslash
culture biologics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting a bunch of good product
videos and a bunch of just general
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently asked questions on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has a source for all of our
videos and all of our science and just
[SPEAKER_00]: documented stuff that we're trying to get
out there for everybody to kind of learn
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're tuning in on YouTube,
I'll definitely have a link to his YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channel down in the description section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this video, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to tune in to future
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim, we might have to do a part three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more we could have got into for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually know that there were some
questions left on the previous episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the next episode we can go over
some of those and then I guess if you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have any questions tuning into this,
leave those questions in the comment
[SPEAKER_01]: section on the YouTube video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, maybe next time around it's just kind
of like a Q&A type thing where we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: firing off a bunch of scientific based
questions at you because your knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to the science is very deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you sat here today and we're
able to get some of that out of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy our conversations and all
the feedback I get from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like just helping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all this stuff in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to go to get out and share with
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's fun and I learned a lot and I'm
sure my audience learned a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, thank you and peace out
everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll catch you in the next episode.
