[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on garden talk so like when you
look at soils or like promix HP the promix
[SPEAKER_00]: high porosity with mycorrhizae It has
almost no mycorrhizae in it because they
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in it like a per yard rate And it's
really small to begin with but they have
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae on the label Microbes are able
to act like a buffer and they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver nutrition at much wider ranges of
pH especially when you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: consortia or Breakdown of the different
microbes that are in there a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't realize with amino acids if they're
not in their L form They are not plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available at all So like it has to be L
amino acids or your plants not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to utilize them at all They actually
make compounds that help the plant be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a more like fibrous and dense root
system the bacillus and the Different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of trichoderma fungi that can be in
there are going to be the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the majority of the work for
everything While mycorrhizae gets all the
[SPEAKER_01]: fame What's up everybody feed that don't
owe me my name is Chris aka mr Grow it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're tuned into the garden talk podcast
This is episode number 27 in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked with guru from the do grow show
He has been gardening for 11 years and
[SPEAKER_01]: grows a variety of plants such as tomatoes
cucumbers blueberries blackberries
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal varieties beets and more in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk all about microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about several different types Of
microbes and how they benefit plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.

[SPEAKER_01]: now let's get into the episode Alright,
we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the garden talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here joined with the grow guru from
the do grow show How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on man?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing happy to be here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited to have you on man I mean
you're I've been watching the do grow show
[SPEAKER_01]: for a very long time and you came on I
know you came on like three four hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes deep or whatever and You just add
so much value to the show and it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: you're knowledge is extensive in so many
different areas and Yeah, it's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: really fun watching you and it's an honor
to kind of have you on here and and pick
[SPEAKER_01]: your brain even deeper so I'm excited pick
away, but before we get into Microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the topic today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get all into microbes Tony different
microbes so much to talk about Tell us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about yourself and how you got
into gardening So, I mean it started when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really young my grandmother got me
into gardening And one of my grandfather's
[SPEAKER_00]: was also a master gardener growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean it just plants were always
around My mom has a beautiful garden and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just always something that
interests me a lot Plants are really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: and I specifically like to take a much
more science approached or science backed
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to medicinal herb gardening for
sure nice And so you decided to you join
[SPEAKER_01]: the dude grow show How did that all come
about if you don't mind me asking?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you kind of join the team there
and that was in?
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017 right 2016 is when I first moved out
to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had met up with Scott a couple years
earlier They had been talking about black
[SPEAKER_00]: dog LED and saying that there's no good
LEDs out there They're all blurples and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and at the time I was in in school
and designing and building my own LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and Selling them to some people
ended up not going along that path But I
[SPEAKER_00]: got in touch with Scott and was like hey
you guys are giving people Really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: advice about this LEDs are the future Hps
is like a thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something you need to talk about
you need to let people know that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: Good information on this out there and
there are good LEDs out there that far
[SPEAKER_00]: surpassed what Ellie or what HPS could do
so Scott flew me out to One of the cups
[SPEAKER_00]: came hung out with them for a while
decided I was gonna move out to Colorado I
[SPEAKER_00]: was still in school at the time and Moved
out and then Scott had a job for me right
[SPEAKER_00]: away and started getting rolling with the
dude grow show That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you you guys really compliment
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you all have different
personalities You know you dude Scotty and
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys just flow so well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool I actually hear that a
lot with on my podcast from the stash with
[SPEAKER_01]: me Rob hitters lifestyle TV and pigeons
420 I feel like it's similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys just flow so well together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome and actually I was gonna say
we're all and you guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all really good foils for each other
Everyone has different approaches to
[SPEAKER_00]: things And it's cool to get those
different ideas For so as a listener to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to listen to that and be able to make
your own decision off of stuff and hear
[SPEAKER_00]: just a variety of ideas Well said I do
have a few numbers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have on the dude gross channel
over 67,000 subscribers one thousand eight
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred ninety two videos over nine point
three million views combined so you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: have been very successful and Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your efforts there and I'm
excited to see what you guys got in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was really cool To be able to
like I grew up in Virginia where I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: everything related to medicinal gardening
was super hush hush And getting out here
[SPEAKER_00]: and being able to be on a YouTube show and
share some knowledge with people and get
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone Just growing better has been
really cool living the dream right and
[SPEAKER_00]: help helping people which is like one of
my favorite things to do and Educating
[SPEAKER_00]: them and helping them at the same time and
then like my favorite thing is hearing a
[SPEAKER_00]: new grower get back in touch with us Say
they found the podcast or the YouTube show
[SPEAKER_00]: and they got their first harvest and it
was awesome And how happy they are that
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking that gets me super rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah before we get deep into specific
microbes Tell us what our microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants and how are they beneficial in
the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple different ways that
those microbial inoculants are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial in the garden first and
foremost They act as root growth promoting
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobacteria where they actually make
compounds That help the plant be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a more like fibrous and dense root
system Which I mean we've all heard it
[SPEAKER_00]: before more roots more fruits and just an
overall healthier plant that can absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: more nutrition Because plants can only
absorb nutrition from the tips of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: and these plant growth Plant growth
promoting rhizobacteria are able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more tips around by growing out more
tertiary and secondary roots But at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time those bacteria have evolved over
millions of years in a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with the plant where not only
do they do that the plant puts out
[SPEAKER_00]: carbohydrates as exudates to feed them and
kind of control the microbial population
[SPEAKER_00]: that's there so that it can like
Exponentially increase the surface area of
[SPEAKER_00]: its root zone and just those microbes are
able to break down nutrient Get it into an
[SPEAKER_00]: ionic form and hold on to it until the
plant signals that it needs it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get it to the plant and none of
that is it That's all as far as like plant
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition and plant growth They also put
up like a no vacancy sign to pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: They would normally get into your your
garden and there'd be room for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and expand and that's when you end up
with something like Pythium or Phypothera
[SPEAKER_00]: Those really bad root diseases,
but when you have good beneficial microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: in there They are making compounds that
make it not a hospital environment for
[SPEAKER_00]: those bad actors And also just puts up the
no vacancy sign telling them like hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no room for you here man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go somewhere else Well, that's pretty cool
that makes sense now some folks I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty well known, you know if you're
a beginner you might not know this but a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of folks that are above the beginner
stage intermediate stage know that there
[SPEAKER_01]: are synthetic nutrients that are plant
available They're already in a form that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant can uptake then there are
organic nutrients Which need to be broken
[SPEAKER_01]: down by microbes first and that's where
microbes are especially important You know
[SPEAKER_01]: having these different microbial
inoculants adding them into the medium to
[SPEAKER_01]: help with that breakdown process Is key on
the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some folks out there that are
gonna say well I'm using synthetic bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or mineral based salt based
whatever you want to call it Microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't going to be beneficial for me at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost definitely not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear this all the time and it's one of
the big myths in gardening, especially in
[SPEAKER_00]: that synthetic style of gardening Those
nutrients There's a big problem with them
[SPEAKER_00]: just washing away or they're being like pH
lockout in the soil Microbes are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: act like a buffer and they're able to
deliver nutrition at much wider ranges of
[SPEAKER_00]: pH Especially when you have a good
consortia or breakdown of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that are in there So yeah,
I mean you microbes are key and in
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic It is important to note that
like endogenous microorganisms ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are just in your yard in the backyard or
in your compost when you brew a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea most of those don't persist That great
in like an agricultural horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: system Just the higher salinity
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more environmental stress on
those microbial populations But one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cool things about microbes is you can go
through successive generations of breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: them really quickly and Kind of select for
the environment that you want to be in and
[SPEAKER_00]: not all microbes are created equal You can
kind of think of them like technology
[SPEAKER_00]: products Where someone's bacillus subtilis
it might Say this exact same thing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label that is bacillus subtilis,
but there can be a wide variety of like
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains of them and how The
different environments that they're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to operate in are so I mean you can have
one thing on one label one on another but
[SPEAKER_00]: like one might work way better because
it's been designed to operate in like that
[SPEAKER_00]: higher salinity environment containerized
gardening like high turnover crops where
[SPEAKER_00]: like you really want to get the best
growth you possibly can as early on and
[SPEAKER_00]: through the entire Life cycle of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely still beneficial even
if you're using synthetic nutrients in an
[SPEAKER_01]: ionized form It's still beneficial to have
microbes to use microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh most definitely because another cool
thing they're able to do it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: adsorbing The microbes do kind of the same
thing soil particles do when ionic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients flow through it Those nutrients
adsorb on to soil particles and then are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuck there until a root comes
along with a higher affinity to That ion
[SPEAKER_00]: that's stuck to the soil particle microbes
kind of act like in that same way where
[SPEAKER_00]: they can adsorb this nutrition and Then be
able to hold on to it in a plant available
[SPEAKER_00]: form and deliver it to the plant So you
don't you can when you're using good
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes You're able to cut back on your
nutrients too just because you're more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently and effectively getting that
into the plant That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I mean a big big myth that we hear
all the time and It's it's taken a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: education for people to be like no,
no, no Like you still need to use it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just talking about in terms of
plant nutrition as a bioprotectant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and prevent especially if you're in
hydroponics preventing pythium and
[SPEAKER_00]: Phypothera I don't know if you've ever had
those in the garden If you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic system and it's connected
together like on a central reservoir that
[SPEAKER_00]: can wipe out an entire garden in a day and
a half Where it turns all your roots your
[SPEAKER_00]: pearly white roots to just mush And a good
way around not ever having to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's using good Microbes in there that act
as a bioprotectant in the soil or in
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever media you're using So the idea is
kind of like pest management But with
[SPEAKER_00]: these pathogens where get the good
microbes in there inhabiting the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when pythium or Phypothera shows
up It never has a chance to even take hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the good microbes are just there and out
compete it for the same resources in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same space What about hydrogen peroxide?
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard that as a remedy for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the remedies kind of going
with the old Style of thinking on things
[SPEAKER_00]: where like I need to keep everything as
sterile as I possibly can like a operating
[SPEAKER_00]: room at a hospital And I mean the same
thing gonna happen in operating rooms in
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have pan resistant bacteria Did just
like no antibiotics work on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get into that where like if you're
just always sterilizing things nature's
[SPEAKER_00]: not sterile and it's really hard really
really hard to keep things sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: especially a plant and you're losing all
of the good Like bioprotectant features of
[SPEAKER_00]: good microbial consortia living in the
root zone because hydrogen peroxide is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna kill Whatever microorganisms you
have in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good and bad, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good ain't good and bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just murk them all And it's kind of
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever noticed people that like
going really heavy antibiotics?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not the same like initially
afterwards you have to eat a lot of yogurt
[SPEAKER_00]: and probiotics where like it just wiped
out your gut microbiome 70% of your Immune
[SPEAKER_00]: system is in your gut microbiome and like
it's extremely Necessary for your health
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a direct connection Just to
analogize people to plants Our our
[SPEAKER_00]: intestines are like our root system Where
they are inhabited by our microbiome that
[SPEAKER_00]: lives in there they help break stuff down
and deliver the nutrition to us Your gut
[SPEAKER_00]: is connected directly to your vagus nerve
all the way straight to your brain and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're starting to find more and more
that the consortia The proportions of
[SPEAKER_00]: different microbes that are in your gut
can have a huge turn-on effect for more
[SPEAKER_00]: than just like your gut health like
there's certain ones that Like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to find like might have more to
do with like anxiety and depression or
[SPEAKER_00]: different middle disorders are really just
an imbalance in your gut microbiome Wow,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really interesting and then kind of
sticking to the topic of the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes Let's talk about CFU colony
forming units.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some recharge right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a microbial inoculant recharge It
says what the microbe is and then next to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says for example 6.4 CFU slash G.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a colony?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is CFU colony forming unit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should grows care about it when
they're shopping for microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So colony colony colony forming units or
CFU's that's in a per gram ratio So that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how many different like actual spores of
that and generally is just used for the
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae that's in there but how many
active growing spores are in each gram and
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to start to inoculate and Grow
along the route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the the more the higher the number of
CFU's you have The more of the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: spores that are in there and it's not
usually a like necessary thing to be on
[SPEAKER_00]: there So like when you look at soils or
like promix HP the promix high porosity
[SPEAKER_00]: with mycorrhizae It has almost no
mycorrhizae in it because they put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: at like a per yard rate and it's really
small to begin with but they have
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizae on the label where something
else like recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ton of mycorrhizae in there and
not just It is a blend of Indo and Ecto
[SPEAKER_00]: for short day flowering plants We do run
into Ecto is really meant for trees like
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas trees is a really good example
Where it branches out away from the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ecto meaning it's it's outside of They've
had different studies and stuff where they
[SPEAKER_00]: had like a whole commercial Christmas tree
farm and they decided To put a fence
[SPEAKER_00]: around it That fence when they did it they
like cut through the ground It was
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounded by a forest they cut off that
Christmas tree farm from its mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: network to the force that's around it and
when it did that it Put the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree into the Christmas tree
farm and decline Because that mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: network was using the forest around it to
support those trees growing there not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary that they had all the nutrients
they needed right where they were But the
[SPEAKER_00]: force was able to support that and when
they put that fence in it cut it off from
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and they Like drastically
noticed that their force was going or that
[SPEAKER_00]: their Christmas tree farm is going into
decline That's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so crazy I want to bring it back to
what you said which you had mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a product that has mycorrhizal
on it But it's like barely anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've actually interviewed somebody on
this podcast before and and this person
[SPEAKER_01]: had said that some products on the market
today Don't have enough CFUs to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: be effective I want to kind of highlight
that point that there could be some
[SPEAKER_01]: products out there where they're on the
label But there's really not enough amount
[SPEAKER_01]: to be effective now when we go through
these individual microbes here I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of kind of putting you under the
gun here if you have any information on
[SPEAKER_01]: What CFUs should be for each of these
microbes as we go through of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: please, you know, let us know so we're not
getting ripped off here Sure, but
[SPEAKER_00]: generally it's look for the highest
numbers you can find Just in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: having more good microbes in there like
those Those populations will figure
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves out once they're in the soil
and into that environment where they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually start to Get selected for the
environment that they're in But yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally just a bigger number is better
in this case and so we don't really need
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry about like a balance We don't
have to like look at the back of the label
[SPEAKER_01]: and say well this only has this CFUs,
but this has a lot Higher and it might
[SPEAKER_01]: throw off the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have to worry about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's so like labeling with things Is
a big game that you have to play the back
[SPEAKER_00]: of labels It's almost always even your
your fertilizers that you buy where it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have like 20 20 20 on the side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a guaranteed minimum That's not
necessarily saying like the exact
[SPEAKER_00]: proportion of everything that's in there
So it's it's so hard and like soil they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to list The ingredients in
order of what's in there the most they put
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae first then list everything
else because they think people will just
[SPEAKER_00]: Think it's the same rules for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like the thing that's in there and
the highest amount is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean It's kind of hard without
actually trying stuff Or getting it tested
[SPEAKER_00]: is even better to see like what it
actually tests out at Wow, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_01]: that about yeah, I thought the order was
in just like food I thought the order it
[SPEAKER_01]: was in was the most amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it's it's all a game a
guaranteed Minimums on those things so
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes it like as the end consumer I
could deal with it all the time with
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory bodies and stuff but the end
consumer it's really hard to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: something and just like By the back of it
be able to know if like one if that is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely truthful Or yeah, it's it just
makes it really difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say with recharge Everything is in
there far exceeds what we have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: label That was like we just put a lower
number on there to be safe with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more of those microbes in
there When you actually get it tested
[SPEAKER_01]: gotcha and just a touch on recharge real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a microbial inoculant It's got a
whole bunch of different things in there
[SPEAKER_01]: Along a bunch of beneficial microbes along
with like kelp molasses humic acids fulvic
[SPEAKER_00]: acids amino acids We we really like to
think about that more There's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial inoculants out there This one
comes together like a really good instant
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea where not only does it have
the wide range of bacillus in there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are targeted at Horticulture and
agricultural systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the trichoderma fungi Molasses is
a food stock for everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're built on kelp as a carrier It's
got the L amino acids and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't realize with amino acids if they're
not in their L form They are not plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available at all So like it has to be L
amino acids or your plants not going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to utilize them at all And then humic
and fulvic acids which just act as like
[SPEAKER_00]: chelators so they help The micros be able
to do their job a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: Effectively so not only are the chelators
they act as kind of catalysts for
[SPEAKER_00]: biological reactions to Where they lower
the energy of activation needed to start a
[SPEAKER_00]: reaction so that it's just a more
efficient Metabolism going on in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha and just for tramps transparency
purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your affiliation with recharge?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an operations manager over at
recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do have Just being just being
transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do work for them Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep now it makes sense, but it is a great
product something I use in my garden off
[SPEAKER_01]: and on like I mentioned in Scotty's
episode is like I try to switch things up
[SPEAKER_01]: for my viewers, you know And if you do the
same thing over and over again the viewers
[SPEAKER_01]: get bored So every once in a while,
I'll kick in some recharge, but I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're nice Now let's get into some of
the individual microbes you have knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: on quite a bit of them Let's start with
the trichoderma want to talk to us about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay trichoderma Trichoderma is one of my
favorite ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is a voracious decomposer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's probably the class I would put it
in Like it's origin story of where
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma actually started comes from a
single point of contact in the South
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific during World War two They had set
up camp somewhere like in the monsoon
[SPEAKER_00]: season in the South Pacific believe in the
Philippines They had wax canvas tents
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere like at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everyone was using they had
set up camp within three days Their wax
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas tents, which are extremely
waterproof and just resistant to anything
[SPEAKER_00]: going on environmentally Started literally
melting away And it's because they had
[SPEAKER_00]: come into contact with some trichoderma
fungi That was collected as a sample
[SPEAKER_00]: brought back to labs and then a lot of
work has been done with it since then It's
[SPEAKER_00]: used in a lot of industrial processes that
like never really get mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used in stone washing jeans Trying to
think of something else it's used in but
[SPEAKER_00]: in gardening they found out that it is
able to really really really quickly Break
[SPEAKER_00]: down those organic nutrients that you'd be
putting into your soil so that they are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get to a plant available form much
faster And yeah, I mean it also is very
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive with other fun guys that are
around And is able to out compete most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pathogenic ones that it's going to
come into contact with and so there are
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains of it just kind of
looking at reaching It's uh, let's see
[SPEAKER_01]: what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got trichoderma reesea I'm gonna
butcher these names by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're warning these names are easily
Be able to be butchered trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: horazium Horazium Horazium I struggle with
that one, too Do you have anything to add
[SPEAKER_01]: like on those specific types of strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's not it's not super necessary to
go into like the specific Strains of those
[SPEAKER_00]: just that trichoderma is like a class It
is very quick at breaking stuff down,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially organic nutrients It it's like
a single celled fun guy So it's not where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna have like mushrooms growing off
of the top of it or anything like that But
[SPEAKER_00]: it really is able to get in there and it's
good for bioprotection And preventing any
[SPEAKER_00]: of those root pathogens from popping up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay gotcha another one that Bacillus,
you know, let's move on to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen bacillus in almost every single
one of the micro products that I that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have and Looks like you guys got three
different strains of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right strains different strains of
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah strains of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Talk to us about bacillus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bacillus is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is one of the like real turn-on effects
in microbial inoculants Most people give
[SPEAKER_00]: the credit to mycorrhizae and that's been
like a buzzword for years in gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't realize that
ectomycorrhizae Can't even infect short
[SPEAKER_00]: day flowering plants or the medicinal
plants people like to grow It just doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have enough time to get in there and start
to build up that network Where the
[SPEAKER_00]: endomycorrhizae is actually the one that
is able to do stuff in there But those
[SPEAKER_00]: have been buzzwords and don't really do
that much in my opinion bacillus are
[SPEAKER_00]: really the like main turn-on effect for
root growth promotion in the soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to make like endogenously
inside of themselves IBA To help plants
[SPEAKER_00]: root out and get more root shoots and
secondary and tertiary rooting so it has
[SPEAKER_00]: like exponentially more root tips to be
able to absorb nutrition from Bacillus are
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool They're also really easy to
start selecting for different environments
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want them to be able to persist
better in And then my favorite fact about
[SPEAKER_00]: them It's all called a consortia when you
have like a population of different
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms and when you have the Right
proportions of the right ones you get an
[SPEAKER_00]: effect It's like much more than some of
their parts where it's not just like an
[SPEAKER_00]: additive effect where they're going
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like Exponentially making it better
and able to have a more Turn-on effect for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about geo bacillus?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm not super familiar with
I know that it was discovered inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: like geysers or hot water vents like at
the bottom of the seabed where These
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacillus, I don't think they have too much
use in plants Just where they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: preferred environment is over like 95
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like right near the the boiling point
of water But really cool microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in industry They're gonna start to
use those a lot more just be in the the
[SPEAKER_00]: type of applications that they're in like
higher heat environments and stuff And I
[SPEAKER_00]: think they also live in like your hot
water heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find them in a hot water heater
sometimes just because it's a place where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like right around a hundred degrees
Celsius all the time and they are
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the only thing that lives in
that type of environment and can can
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about glomus?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that on a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glomus is mycorrhizae So there's an
endo and an ecto form of it ecto is on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of the root and grows like out
into the soil and In an effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does exponentially increase the surface
area of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the plant deal with environmental
stress better just endogenously it is able
[SPEAKER_00]: to Kind of handle those stresses better
the the microbes can help elicit a Like
[SPEAKER_00]: acquired resistance response from the
plant where it knows like hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to close up my my pores Because I
need to conserve water in like a time of
[SPEAKER_00]: drought They're pretty cool again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like CF use just kind of going back to
that when somebody's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: this Right here has you know, 6.4 CF use
per gram You just the more the better,
[SPEAKER_01]: huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like can you overdo?
[SPEAKER_00]: The more the better Generally,
no, you're not gonna be able to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess you could in a like
financial sense Okay, and where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just throwing money away at some point I
Generally don't think of the mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in most microbial products as being
something that's really doing all that
[SPEAKER_00]: much Just because you have to get it on
super early In the the growth of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's not that many roots so that
it is able to grow alongside the root as
[SPEAKER_00]: it grows in microbial inoculants and in
microbiology and soils the the bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Different types of trichodermal
fungi that can be in there are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that are doing The majority of
the work for everything while mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_01]: gets all the fame now mycorrhizae I heard
that it's a lot like significantly less
[SPEAKER_01]: effective watering in mycorrhizae versus
sprinkling onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Most most definitely that's one of the
things a lot of people don't realize with
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that for that Colony forming unit to
be able to actually Infect a root a root
[SPEAKER_00]: has to come in direct contact with it It
can't just pass by it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to directly make contact with the
root That's why with with recharge water
[SPEAKER_00]: is always the carrier for it It gets it
evenly and thoroughly through the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's a root in there some
mycorrhizae Is gonna make contact with it
[SPEAKER_00]: with just a pure mycoproduct or something
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Powering the roots is what you're gonna
want to do just because in that case at
[SPEAKER_00]: least you know You're making contact with
the roots like we were talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: promix earlier where they have the promix
with mycorrhizae in there There's not that
[SPEAKER_00]: much mycorrhizae in there to begin with
and just the odds are not stacked in your
[SPEAKER_00]: favor That a root is actually going to
make contact with like the one colony
[SPEAKER_00]: forming unit That's around in a pot once
you've planted something in there So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean making sure that it gets contact
with a root is Definitely gonna help it be
[SPEAKER_00]: more effective at infecting that root and
being able to give you those beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: effects of it Now would you go so far as
to say that you shouldn't water it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wouldn't go that far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's definitely times where
like you're just not gonna be able to Pull
[SPEAKER_00]: out a plant and powder the roots with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean if if you Have a high
enough CFU like what's in recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely can water it in Although we
really just have the mycorrhizae in there
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to say like yeah, it's in there
too We have that but we're really proud of
[SPEAKER_00]: the consortia of the different bacillus
and trichoderma that are in recharge Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really really curious to know like for
example great white is one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: products that is known for mycorrhizae
We're really curious to know like of that
[SPEAKER_01]: scoop of great white you're mixing into
water and putting in there what percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: Is actually gonna be hitting the roots,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably an answer you
don't have but yeah not one I have off the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of my head and just want to admit like
I Greatly respect great white and what
[SPEAKER_00]: they did started to bring like a premium
microbe Consortia out to the public and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it out there But a lot of
innovation has gone on recently in
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the biggest expanding field in
agriculture and horticulture it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just It's like the big next thing in
agriculture where people are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that like just dumping fertilizer
especially in commercial agriculture out
[SPEAKER_00]: in fields and everything that just dumping
fertilizer on your land was killing off
[SPEAKER_00]: all the endogenous microorganisms that you
had and making it really really hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: garden there where you it's more treating
it like Hydroponics at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil is just your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely dead and inert But yeah
getting back to bringing the life into
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil is I Mean it helps everybody
uh-huh and just getting being more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient at the fertilizer that you do
use It's it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm I'm excited to be in this field Kind
of piggybacking off of what you just said
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic Fertilizers do they really kill
off microbes or do the microbes feed off
[SPEAKER_01]: of some of them or what's your take on
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It like we were talking about earlier
depends on what microbes you're using if
[SPEAKER_00]: you Were brewing up a compost tea with
some like soil from the forest that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: gone and collected Yeah, the the different
chemical fertilizers and synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers are gonna kill some of your
microbes but if you're using ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been selected and bred for their
virulency and they're able their ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to persist in those horticulture and
agricultural systems like we as medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners use They are they thrive in that
situation where they are able to Absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: and hold on to nutrition act as a
bioprotectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care that the salts are
around them They've been selected to live
[SPEAKER_00]: in that environment and been be able to
thrive there So no, um, if you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: the right microbes then no, there's no
issue with using Being in like a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: salinity environment using synthetics or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about pH up and pH down?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of people they'll Get
their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll need to pH adjust their water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe though the original water that they
have Is coming in too high for example as
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium bicarbonate says high pH So I
needed to add in a couple drops of pH down
[SPEAKER_01]: which normal pH down I believe most of
them are phosphoric acid And so they think
[SPEAKER_01]: that those couple drops all it really
takes is a couple drops two three drops
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a milliliter to bring that down to
the acceptable range now There are people
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that to use that phosphoric acid
mix in get their water adjusted But then
[SPEAKER_01]: when they water their plants like you're
killing off microbes What's your know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you actually dilute the pH up and
pH down It's not gonna have any effect on
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes like I was saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to operate at a real wide
range of pH's and just a Pretty good point
[SPEAKER_00]: to make the water when you're doing that
is not their native environment We want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them out of the water and into the
soil as soon as we possibly can To prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: selecting for a waterborne environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are root growth or root borne
Microorganisms they are meant to be in the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to keep them in the water
too long It's just meant to be a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good even thorough carrier to get them all
the way through the soil Instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: having like pockets of it here and there
now what about adding pH up and pH down
[SPEAKER_01]: directly?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're kind of getting off topic
here We're talking about microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this kind of follows up here So when
you're adding pH up and pH down directly
[SPEAKER_01]: to a nutrient mix, I've heard that That's
gonna bind with some of those nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially make Them an unusable form
so it was recommended that you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: Diluting down right mixing your pH up and
down in water first So it bonds to that
[SPEAKER_01]: and then putting it into your nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a true story or is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: True story in general chemistry That's
gonna be the way that you would want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that just to where you're not adding
concentrated acid or concentrated base To
[SPEAKER_00]: your solution that already has nutrients
in it just because it is fairly easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: us Chemical reactions to happen there and
you have some like fallout or precipitate
[SPEAKER_00]: is what it's called in chemistry where I
don't know if you ever mixed up the main
[SPEAKER_00]: one people see is silica where they'll mix
up their nutrients first and then put
[SPEAKER_00]: silica in and you just see it get all
cloudy and then there's like Silicate at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of your your reservoir and
that's just where that silica Can't go in
[SPEAKER_00]: a concentrated form can't go in with
anything else It needs to get diluted
[SPEAKER_00]: first so that when you mix the other stuff
in It's not in that high concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna cause a precipitate or
anything like that Most of the time with
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes when you're watering them in You
want to mix your nutrients how you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally do so if you're mixing silica mix
that first Go ahead and mix up your A or B
[SPEAKER_00]: pH how you normally do and then go ahead
and add the microbes in is like the last
[SPEAKER_00]: thing so that they're not Experiencing a
huge pH change or anything when they get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the water They do raise the pH just
as a function of that Their biology water
[SPEAKER_00]: is not their native environment like we
were talking about We want to get them in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil as soon as they get in the soil,
which is their native environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They start to make carbonic acid and
carboxylic acid Like there's a whole group
[SPEAKER_00]: of acids that they're able to make and
that's how they buffer and regulate the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: around Themselves and where they inhabit
the root zone so it kind of makes it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where pH doesn't matter as much anymore
because a much more natural system is
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking care of that for you Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you confirmed that dilute the pH
up and pH down because I actually made a
[SPEAKER_01]: video on that and it has over a hundred
thousand views and You know, that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned and I wanted to confirm it with
people and you kind of confirmed that one
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was people in the comment section
like no way this is bullshit useless blah
[SPEAKER_00]: blah blah blah, so And just want to
clarify too that you can still put pH up
[SPEAKER_00]: or pH down directly into your nutrient
solution Especially if it's being stirred
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole time because it's only going to
be super concentrated as like the couple
[SPEAKER_00]: seconds of that drop hits the water and
then it gets diluted right away and
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not really that much opportunity
for like a precipitate to form Or you just
[SPEAKER_00]: start to change what's going on in that
nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not detrimental No, not not super
detrimental and the main one is silica mix
[SPEAKER_00]: your silica up with plain water first And
then start mixing in your nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me go Let's get back on the individual
micro is kind of off course a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's it all relates And it's
really good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah this next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna have trouble pronouncing pan
bacillus Pan bacillus is just another one
[SPEAKER_00]: of Like classification of different
bacillus that are out there and it acts
[SPEAKER_00]: like a root growth promoting or
isobacteria They're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make IAA indole acetic acid some
other root growth promotion enzymes and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and I think that they're able to
elicit somewhat of a SARS response from
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to where it kind of just gets it
ready for If there was gonna be some type
[SPEAKER_00]: of pathogen or bug coming around it's just
gonna be better able to deal with those
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses and better able to Trigger its
immune response coming from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay How about pseudonymous?
[SPEAKER_01]: I pronounce that one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudomonas pseudomonas That's gonna be
one that lives much more like on plant
[SPEAKER_00]: surfaces, I'm pretty sure um, so That'd be
the one you'll see in like foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial products a lot Not one that I'm
super familiar with that's something I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do a little bit more research on
myself Okay, the last one I have on the
[SPEAKER_01]: list here is streptomyces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that one right streptomyces I told
you I was gonna be butchering names The
[SPEAKER_00]: pseudomonas streptomyces like all are
pretty much just like plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters Make some substances that kind
of out compete Pathogens that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: coming around and then can kind of help
make the trigger the plant to start making
[SPEAKER_00]: its own Like root growth promotion
substances that it makes in their IAA IBA
[SPEAKER_01]: other stuff like that Okay, is there any
other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes you that I didn't list off that
you think we should cover or is that
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much the most of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think we pretty much got most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about I got a couple other things
for you amino acids you touched on them a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit earlier You mentioned that have
to be in the L form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else you could talk to
us about amino acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So L amino acids are necessary for all
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just plants like we need amino acids
our body makes amino acids They're like
[SPEAKER_00]: the building blocks for enzymes Inzoms act
as catalysts for chemical reactions where
[SPEAKER_00]: they make them Like the soil has to exert
less energy to get a chemical reaction to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen So it's just kind of overall
optimizing the entire system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps plants translocate nutrients
better There I mean they're huge
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in When people in synthetics
are trying to grow high bricks plants one
[SPEAKER_00]: of their like limiting factors and being
able to get to like a higher bricks level
[SPEAKER_00]: which corresponds with a higher plant
health and resistant to pathogens and bugs
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything But like the the main thing
that they're missing when they're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that is having those amino acids and
amino acids aren't just Like just singular
[SPEAKER_00]: things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be complexed with other things
Where it can help nitrogen get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can help Just about anything get into
the plant better It's it's just one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: big things in like the newer
[SPEAKER_00]: Biofertilizers that are coming out Did the
use of those amino acids and using them
[SPEAKER_00]: for their intended purpose to help
nutrients get into the plant and help the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant just overall optimize its metabolism
better Has helped a lot of people get to
[SPEAKER_00]: like another yield threshold in their
garden Or get over a certain yield
[SPEAKER_00]: limiting factor Sometimes those L amino
acids are going to be the limiting factor
[SPEAKER_01]: there So like you mentioned amino acids
has multiple uses one thing I learned
[SPEAKER_01]: actually from Harley Smith shout out to
Him I took his master growers course last
[SPEAKER_01]: year specifically for hydroponic growers
now, correct me if I'm wrong here,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So hydroponic growers some of the calcium
you'll get like like the ring around the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium deposits basically it Basically
calcium carbonate is what it turns into if
[SPEAKER_01]: using hard water for example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yeah that that calcium is bonding to
like dissolve carbon dioxide in the water
[SPEAKER_01]: and making that calcium Carbonate and a
little trick to avoid that is what he had
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned is sprinkle a little bit of
amino acids in that water And it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: actually bind to the amino acid will
prevent that ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah those things from occurring which I
thought was super interesting That's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about with like amino
complex nutrients where yeah, it makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% just more bio available to the plant
and prevents any type of lockout going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there just because it will have a much
higher affinity to that calcium than the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate that's a In its dissolve or the
the CO2 that's dissolved into the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha Another thing that I wanted to
bring up is dextrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we kind of briefly talked about this
before we started recording Dextrose it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I mean I got a another
micro product here is blue planet
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients root magic rhizome mix and it
says 20% dextrose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain to us what it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: So dextrose is just a type of sugar that's
made by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's what plants do They
photosynthesize sunlight CO2 and water and
[SPEAKER_00]: turn that into carbohydrates and sugars
for themselves to be able to use for
[SPEAKER_00]: energy to Make the medicinal flowers that
we like death.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dextrose is one of those like sucrose
fruit fruitose glucose I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a whole range of sugars I'm never
gonna be one to say more diversity and
[SPEAKER_00]: something is a bad thing So like if you're
trying to do the best you possibly can
[SPEAKER_00]: using a variety of sugar sources Is not
the worst idea in the world But molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: it generally acts as like the one of the
better food sources for microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: Just where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has everything they need and yeah,
I mean You can use like some people use
[SPEAKER_00]: honey some people use Like high fructose
corn syrup if they're crazy Like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of different options brown sugar
brown sugar out there and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of sugars can actually bloom out
different types of microbes will prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of sugar sources So yeah
using a wide variety of you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the most diversity you possibly can
Or with something like recharge using the
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses that's in there is meant for the
the the microbes that are in there as
[SPEAKER_01]: their food source molasses Little we want
to get a little bit deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been told that It shouldn't be used
as a soldier wrench At least there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: people out there that say there's research
that backs that it should be Is this a
[SPEAKER_01]: little trench because it And I'm speaking
about my head a little bit here It binds
[SPEAKER_01]: with something it clogs up the roots
prevents nutrient uptake something on
[SPEAKER_01]: those lines Are you familiar with that at
all or it can if you use it in really
[SPEAKER_00]: really high concentrations It can start to
clog root pores And and clog up root tips
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it's not able to absorb as much
nutrition You kind of run into the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing with humic acids, too You have to
use a ton of them like a ton a ton of them
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can start to clog root pores and
stuff like that Generally not a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: with people's gardens at all unless
they're like I dumped the whole bottle of
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses into my watering can and like try
and go water that in like Then you might
[SPEAKER_00]: have an issue if you're using it at like a
teaspoon per gallon or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: There shouldn't be an issue at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually is a tablespoon per gallon
Tablespoon per gallon shouldn't be an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue at all either.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, guru.
