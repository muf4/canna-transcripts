[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 132.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Michael Box
from Sustainable Village.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the podcast once before,
episode 50, where he talked about the
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods of auto watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his recommendations for auto watering
setups for different size containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode, we continue talking about
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about moisture release curves,
moisture meters, new irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, and more.

[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to have you back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were on episode 50, and I actually
re-listened to it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had 85,000 views on it so far on
YouTube, so monstrous number of views
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was an overwhelming amount of
people in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just so thankful on the knowledge
that you would drop in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for that, and I'm really happy
to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: on the episode today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to get into
what's happening in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly relating to irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to get into some of the
new watering technology that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help maintain that perfect moisture level
that everyone's seeking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get into moisture
release curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, sure, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Michael Box.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am based here in Boulder, Colorado,
and I've been out here for 20-some years.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as my background as it relates to
irrigation, I've been in that industry for
[SPEAKER_02]: probably 20 years as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have worked on a number of organic farms
and market gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a younger guy, and we used to
run a CSA program here in Boulder,
[SPEAKER_02]: got into the medicinal production world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably back in 2008 or something like
that in a kind of serious way,
[SPEAKER_02]: and was in some businesses related to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I really started off as just a
hands-on guy, a grower and producer for
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers markets, and then moved into other
crops and also did a lot of irrigation
[SPEAKER_02]: installation during that time too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a background in permaculture,
agriculture, irrigation installation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, my current role here,
I work for a company called Sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: Village, and run all their operations,
and I'm the lead designer for the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We produce designs, irrigation designs,
and supply parts for lots of controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: environment agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think indoor growth, facilities,
greenhouses, people that are growing at
[SPEAKER_02]: home, as well as ag projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do large-scale regenerative ag
irrigation, and we work with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool partners in that space all
around the front range of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, and we also have a line of
products for house plants and things like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but they're fun and useful,
but the real exciting stuff I feel and
[SPEAKER_02]: what I feel passionate about is systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always been really a student of
systems and whether they're human systems
[SPEAKER_02]: or flow technologies like water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, like a lot of us have done a lot
of things in our lives, but it keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: circling back to water for me and whether
it's how it flows and moves and how plants
[SPEAKER_02]: use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've been able to build a really cool
team of people that I get to work with on
[SPEAKER_02]: a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything I present here today,
really, I want to just be upfront that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a couple other guys that work
with me here on our design team.
[SPEAKER_02]: Izzy Becker and Cooper Didier are kind of
my two main supports for research and
[SPEAKER_02]: information and helping with the design
systems as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's kind of the basic background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we've met at MJBaseCon years ago,
and every year I think you're there and we
[SPEAKER_00]: bump into each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018, I remember meeting you back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Soil Summit, which was a few
months back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a great event.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Izzy was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he had a talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you had like a hands-on thing that
you were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a recap on the Soil
Summit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of talk about some other
educational events that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: participated in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that don't know,
the Soil Life Summit was an event that
[SPEAKER_02]: Grassroots Fabric Pots, they put on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's their second annual.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this one was really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was out in Pahrump, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was on the farm that was owned by Steve
Cantwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has a business called Green Life
Productions, and he's a really kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: early adopter, pioneer in living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a cool guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyways, it was hosted on his farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brought together a really wide
smattering of really smart people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had a bunch of the major soil
producers were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some great agronomists giving
speeches and talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of workshops, hands-on
workshops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was overall just a really great
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope they keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they're talking about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep doing those events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are really kind of a follow-up
to the regen conferences, they were
[SPEAKER_02]: called.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like a science of regenerative
production or something like that that
[SPEAKER_02]: were held.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was initially up in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh Rutherford put all those on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they were up in Humboldt County,
and then they had a bunch traveling around
[SPEAKER_02]: the US.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that project transitioned out,
and grassroots took up a similar version.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are events that I've been
participating in for quite a few years
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually just as a speaker and attendee.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always great learning
environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this last one, our whole team went,
Cooper, Izzy, and I.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Izzy did a really great job.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a great talk on basically soil
moisture data and moisture release curves,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the new tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about some of those things
today, I imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Cooper and I built out a big
display station with lots of raised beds
[SPEAKER_02]: and pots and all kinds of different water
sources and built blue mat systems all
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout those and operated them and
then gave a couple hour workshop on how to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that, which was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really great to put all the
information in one place and show it off
[SPEAKER_02]: and answer questions in real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, honestly, if we do some of these
events in the future, we're kicking around
[SPEAKER_02]: the idea of maybe having a longer form
irrigation workshop at something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really curious what people's feedback
would be on that if it's something they'd
[SPEAKER_02]: be interested in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that, we do trade shows
periodically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just out in Minnesota maybe two,
three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Izzy gave a presentation there and that
got a lot of really good feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so those kind of industry trade
shows we go to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're hit or miss and whether
they're worth going to or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the last one was Minnesota was an
interesting market to be in, like a new
[SPEAKER_02]: state that recently changed their laws to
allow different kinds of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are always kind of fun places to
be where there's new people that are
[SPEAKER_02]: learning for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what did you think of the Soil Life
Summit there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to catch Izzy's talk and it was
loaded with information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'd like to get him on the
podcast if he'd like to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he can hook me up on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he had so much good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture release curve which is what
we're going to get into here in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember him talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't get a chance to attend the
workshop, but that whole summit was
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll definitely be there next year if
it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, before we get into the moisture
release curves, is there anything else
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the industry, particularly
related to cultivation or irrigation that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were in a unique position here because
we work with cultivators all over the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of big projects in Australia
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just sent a big system to Thailand this
week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're all over the globe actually
working with growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get to talk to a lot of people and
see what they're up to and what their pain
[SPEAKER_02]: points are, what their struggles are,
how they're doing, what kind of prices
[SPEAKER_02]: they're getting for products, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's a cool spot to be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also work with a lot of different soil
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the other major living soil
companies recommend our products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of good customers through
that and clients to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening, man?
[SPEAKER_02]: All kinds of stuff's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on which state you're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's markets that have had these legal
markets for long periods of time and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really established markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not seeing as many new facilities
going in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado's a good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not a ton of new projects
happening in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we're based here, we do
probably 95% of our work outside of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the ones that do go in in those
established markets are very large.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not crazy for us to be working on
100,000 square feet of indoor production
[SPEAKER_02]: in some of those markets, which we do do
with more of our kind of traditional drip
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation designs and engineering.
[SPEAKER_02]: The places that are the most fun to work
are states that are newer markets or
[SPEAKER_02]: markets that have something's changed or
shifted and there's a revitalized energy
[SPEAKER_02]: around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you get these medium-sized facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, back to that living soil piece,
a lot of them are living soil growers that
[SPEAKER_02]: are growing a boutique product that might
fetch a higher price.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like working with those folks too
because the newer growers are always
[SPEAKER_02]: really open to new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that seasoned, experienced
folks aren't either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if they're still successful,
they probably are pretty open.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're always open to new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's sometimes a little easier
to talk to the empty cup versus the one
[SPEAKER_02]: that's already overflowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I mean, we could go on about
specifics there, but I think the last year
[SPEAKER_02]: has been really challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think overall that industry was kind of
in a bit of a slump last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the folks that are in other
kind of ancillary businesses like ours
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe provide soil or lighting or
nutrients or whatever had kind of tough
[SPEAKER_02]: years in 2022, 2023.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it really speaks to... I think
a great thing to do is look around and see
[SPEAKER_02]: who's still operating as businesses that
are kind of providing services in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and also the growers and
suppliers and who's still operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not to say that lots of really good
people that knew what they were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't able to continue running a
business, but the ones that are still
[SPEAKER_02]: operating probably have a pretty good
product and know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they stuck it out through those
last couple of years, I think this next
[SPEAKER_02]: year is going to be a bump.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be a kind of an
upswing in sales and all products related
[SPEAKER_02]: to that and to the actual material itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think I look forward to 2024.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're already seeing kind of a pretty
massive spike in what we're doing just in
[SPEAKER_02]: the last two months, which is typical for
like springtime.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always see a big boost in sales and in
projects being actually launching this
[SPEAKER_02]: time of year.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I'm just seeing more and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing more and more home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just really, really doing their
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a group of people we've always
worked with closely for irrigation and
[SPEAKER_02]: helping them kind of automate their home
grows and free up time and have better
[SPEAKER_02]: success and better yields and better
product and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that group of people, that home
growers, they've been with us for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time and we don't ever forget that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited to serve them even
better moving forward here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The home growers, that's really most of
the audience listening into this right now
[SPEAKER_00]: grow at home, whether it be indoors or
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, talking about the industry and
how there's been struggles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen it particularly with lighting
companies getting closed down left and
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's been a handful of
companies within the past couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: that have closed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sad to see, but hope we go back
to an incline here where as far as more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more states legalizing it,
more and more people getting into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll just have to kind of wait and
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like our strategy with that,
with staying alive in there is that
[SPEAKER_02]: constant innovation piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, look what we're doing and look
what's going well.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the problems?
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, okay, how do we go and solve
those problems and get a better product?
[SPEAKER_02]: And really just staying on the head of the
curve as much as possible, always looking
[SPEAKER_02]: at new tech as it's coming available or
we're developing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, again, you look at like lighting
companies, a lot of them are doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind of selling very,
very similar products and coming out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the same production facilities,
maybe overseas or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I think innovation and forward
moving is a good strategy for staying
[SPEAKER_02]: alive in a competitive world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get into new technology
here in a minute, but first I want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into moisture release curves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's something that I don't think a
lot of my audience is really aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us all about moisture release
curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: A moisture release curve is a graph,
the chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got X and Y axes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a vertical and a horizontal axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the vertical axis is often represented
by volumetric water content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me just jump into this point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two main ways to measure soil
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the first is through VWC, volumetric
water content, your VWC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second is soil moisture tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are two different data points
that you can pull out of any soil
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to give you different
numbers in different units of measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So volumetric water content is the
percentage of water that is made up of the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe it's 50%, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a soil solution might be 50% water or
40% water or 30% water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by volume, it's 30% water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of really cool data that
you can pull out of that and strategy that
[SPEAKER_02]: can be developed based on that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second way to measure soil moisture is
through tensiometers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tensiometers are devices that measure
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what those devices usually look like,
well, honestly, they look a lot like the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue mats do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a ceramic tip, like a ceramic cone
with a tube on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then attached to that is some sort of
pressure gauge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the soil dries out, it creates a
negative pressure inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that negative pressure is expressed as
a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll read in units of pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's often measured in centibars or
millibars, which is just as a little
[SPEAKER_02]: something to note.
[SPEAKER_02]: One bar is equal to one atmosphere of
pressure or 15 psi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really like the metric style of
measuring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's measuring pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we use the psi in standard
measurements.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then in metric, it's in bars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a millibar is 1,000th of a bar,
or a centibar is 100th of a bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are these units of pressure that
are measured.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of those tensiometers either
measure in centibars or millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we jump back to the moisture release
curve itself, we have that vertical axis
[SPEAKER_02]: that's measuring percentage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're having the horizontal axis,
which is measuring millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we see is there's a graph that
gets expressed on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it starts high on the vertical axis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it will be steady for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that indicates a really high percentage
of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will be flat for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that'll translate to a low tensiometer
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when it's flat at the top,
that indicates a full saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're at a point of runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if any more water was added,
it would immediately run off out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that curve, it's flat for a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it falls off precipitously and
plunges down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the soil drying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the percentage of water drops,
the soil moisture tension starts to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it drops off pretty steeply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it starts to kind of ease that
curve off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get this kind of nice rounded piece
of the graph.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it flattens out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that when it flattens out again,
very low on the graph, that's your
[SPEAKER_02]: permanent wilt point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the soil has dried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no more moisture left in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each soil medium out there has a
unique moisture release curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost like a fingerprint for each
soil, has its own particular moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: release curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are methods for determining what
a custom blend might be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Specifically, a lot of major manufacturers
of soil have that data that you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also some pretty clear soil types.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty standard for certain soil
types.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll measure it in sandy loam soils
or bark they usually use as one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: controls, like pine bark.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then cocoa or peat or engineered
potting soil blends that use organic
[SPEAKER_02]: material, which would kind of be like a
living soil mix, something that has
[SPEAKER_02]: perlite and either peat or cocoa and
compost in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all kind of have different shaped
curves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they dry out in different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why this data is really interesting is
you can determine the moisture release
[SPEAKER_02]: curve of a particular soil medium or soil
composition and then find that chart and
[SPEAKER_02]: then understand what are the targets that
we want to hit for irrigating that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when do we want to start an irrigation
event?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when do we want to stop it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we say we irrigate like a
cocoa-based soil, it's going to start at
[SPEAKER_02]: one point.
[SPEAKER_02]: The irrigation is going to turn off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be high up on the percentage
and low on the tension.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's going to start to dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to get down to a point
that's approaching the wilt point,
[SPEAKER_02]: which we don't ever want to hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's a point on that curve
where we can kind of identify it very
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can say that's our trigger point
for another irrigation event.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's going to go back to the top
of that curve and go back down again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're keeping the moisture level within
a window where it is plant available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we don't want to oversaturate
it, because then it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: plant available and it's going to do harm
to the plant itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want to dry it out too much,
because again, we're going to do harm and
[SPEAKER_02]: damage to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other factors to look at too,
which is the nutrient content in your EC
[SPEAKER_02]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the percentage of water drops,
your EC increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because as the percentage of
water drops, the concentration just
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes greater of whatever nutrients in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you took, I don't know, you would
like have a pot of coffee like on the
[SPEAKER_02]: burner and it cooks down and it cooks down
and eventually would turn into like kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sludge, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've removed the water,
but there's still material in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same kind of concept with
drying it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of what, like crop steering,
so that's a term that gets thrown around a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in different ways, what that is,
is cycling plants back and forth on that
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture release curve and drying them out
to a point where the plant is still
[SPEAKER_02]: uptaking water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still nutrient available.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant available, the water content
in the soil, but the nutrient level is
[SPEAKER_02]: very high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's able to uptake a lot of nutrients
and then taking it right down to a point
[SPEAKER_02]: before it's starting to damage the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then introducing another irrigation
event and kind of repeating that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this kind of pulsing cycle that
looked at over time is up and down and up
[SPEAKER_02]: and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's dry, wet, dry, wet,
but within a very specific band of
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're measuring intensiometers and
you're using millibars to measure that,
[SPEAKER_02]: something like a cocoa has a pretty large
window.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might be able to start irrigating when
it dries down to 70 millibars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you wanna irrigate back until it
hits about 10 millibars, which is very
[SPEAKER_02]: wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then let it dry back down to 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of like a peat-based living soil kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna start irrigating around 100,
between 100 and 120, depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: composition, and water it down to like 40
or 50 millibars and then repeat that
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there's some really cool stuff
that happens in there to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get these generative cues that are
introduced to the plant when you cycle it
[SPEAKER_02]: through that dryback phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the other terms gets thrown
around a lot is like drybacks.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your dryback?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing this?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're looking at is running the
soil down that moisture release curve and
[SPEAKER_02]: drying it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why do we do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't wanna dry it out to a point
of wilt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stresses the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna be permanent damage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna impact yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna impact vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna, you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by drying it back to just before the
point where we're hitting that,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're introducing the concept of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not actually stressing the plant,
like on a real level, but we're letting
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant know and, you know, I'm gonna
turn the plant into a person here for a
[SPEAKER_02]: second.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're introducing that
concept of stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do that, it's kind of
reminding the plant that, hey,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an end to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's impermanence that does exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can trigger, you know, doing it
within certain windows, like having a
[SPEAKER_02]: longer dryback period will help induce
flowering in a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keeping it in a narrow wetter band will
keep a plant in a vegetative state longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But by drying it back a little bit more,
we're gonna see a, we're giving it a
[SPEAKER_02]: generative cue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where we're telling the plant,
hey, it's time to start the second half of
[SPEAKER_02]: your life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to start producing flowers and
to start a fruit set.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, again, there's things with
moisture levels that can be done to
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulate those functions in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot you can kind of take
each one of those little places there and
[SPEAKER_02]: jump off and talk more about it and talk
about specific strategy that's species
[SPEAKER_02]: specific or strain specific even.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the general concept of a
moisture release curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you breaking that down for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of people that do drybacks or
drought stress, precision stress in that
[SPEAKER_00]: method in order to, you know, try to
achieve several things, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they're trying to stress out the
plant to have more secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_00]: or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, those numbers that you mentioned
there it's 70 millibars at that point to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll go down to 10, which you
said is considered wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that using the blue mat moisture meter?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told that now I hear so much
conflicting information online where I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe the general range for those meters
would be you wanna stay in between 50 and
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred millibars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that not correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what would be the ideal range to stay
in?
[SPEAKER_02]: So 50 and a hundred millibars is a great
range for a living soil blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or really most potting soil mixes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything that is in, yeah, so it's
like, again, that's a blend of some sort
[SPEAKER_02]: of compost, some sort of aeration material
like perlite, and something that holds a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of water, like something very porous
like peat or cocoa that's gonna absorb
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That 70, 10 range, that's if you're
running pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's more of like a hydro kind of
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it dries out quick, cocoa dries out
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it does have a little bit
wider and you can bring the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a lot wetter and operate it at
a much wetter level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why that 10 is the number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, yeah, so if you're running in a
hydro kind of environment where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using synthetic nutrients in cocoa,
that's the range I'd go with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if it's in potting soil, like an
amended potting soil, engineered media,
[SPEAKER_02]: however you wanna describe it,
living soil mix, that 50 to 100 is
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that in large field
applications with overhead watering and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of sensor data.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that with drip irrigation,
like in a larger hydro facility or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can use blue mats to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the blue mats are like, we've talked
about them before, but just to give a
[SPEAKER_02]: quick recap what they are, is they're a
tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the people that are watching this
visually, it's one of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tube, it's a plastic tube with a
ceramic tip on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is a valve at the very top
of it with a tube running through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that valve opens and closes based on
the soil moisture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the soil dries out, the tip dries
out, the negative pressure is created
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the tube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a diaphragm in here that is
sucked down.
[SPEAKER_02]: By that negative pressure, which opens a
valve physically on the top of the,
[SPEAKER_02]: we call them carats, the mat carats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that valve opens and water's able to
flow through the tube and then it'll drip
[SPEAKER_02]: out either into, just directly into the
pot in a very small container.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could feed into a drip ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really interesting kind of
products like these drip rings that they
[SPEAKER_02]: can feed right into that have emitters in
them and then drip in many different
[SPEAKER_02]: spots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we use a soaker hose, we call it Blue
Soak, and it's made out of Tyvek.
[SPEAKER_02]: It operates at really, really low
pressures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so these are the water delivery
mechanisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the basic functionality is that soil
dries out, a valve opens, the system
[SPEAKER_02]: waters up to a certain trigger point,
then the water turns off and then you get
[SPEAKER_02]: that dry back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, that's the same thing with that
moisture relief curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're watering, the soil's getting wetter
and wetter towards the top of the curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water turns off and then it dries back
and the soil dries back and dries back and
[SPEAKER_02]: dries back until it hits a lower set point
and then it turns itself on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if you're using some sort of digital
sensor or something like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you might have that that's operating a
pump or solenoid valves in a drip
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation system to turn it on also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are some of the more
sophisticated ways of doing it with
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots and lots of sensors that can
do that some better than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, when you're in that vegetative
state of growth, you're keeping it wetter
[SPEAKER_02]: in a narrow band of wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the flowering state, particularly
in stretch at the transition point,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to have a wider, you want to have
a bigger dry back period there too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we found with the Blue Soak and
the Blue Mats is that they kind of do that
[SPEAKER_02]: on their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're placing the soil and
operate, when the plants are smaller and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in veg, they are keeping it in a
pretty narrow band because they're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: water and keep up with that moisture
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a much more static wet-dry-wet-dry
period in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as soon as the plants hit
stretch, they start consuming water much
[SPEAKER_02]: faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it takes a little bit of time for
the Blue Mats to catch back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without adjusting anything,
you're getting longer dry back periods
[SPEAKER_02]: during the stretch and flower periods when
there's more water consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you want more dry backs,
they're kind of automatically doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: and cycling through that moisture release
curve.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, they're kind of doing this
automatic crop steering just on the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for anyone wanting more details on
Blue Mats or what Blue Mats set up to use
[SPEAKER_00]: for each container size, we did all of
that in the last episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I urge you to check out the last
episode that Michael and I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went into detail about all of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to flip it up though and talk about
some new technology for watering plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is new things that are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what excites people a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about some of the new
technology for watering plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what we've been doing here,
we do our own R&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do that through some of the,
we have a facility, we have kind of just a
[SPEAKER_02]: small operation here at our warehouse and
offices.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people we know and work with
have their own home grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's quite a few larger
commercial growers either in here in
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado or in other places in the country
that we'd like to collaborate with.
[SPEAKER_02]: To really do all those R&D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the process that we go through is yeah,
usually one of the guys here at the office
[SPEAKER_02]: starts messing with some idea at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we try to replicate it here in
the office.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we send out a bunch of systems
and do some pilot programs with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, we've had really cool kind of,
that's how we've done a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: honestly, is in collaboration with the
customers that we work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the big thing that we've been doing is
with blue mats, because that's kind of our
[SPEAKER_02]: wheelhouse mostly, is to preset the blue
mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the past when you would get a blue
mat carrot and you would set it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd hook it all up to the system,
there'd be a process where you would dial
[SPEAKER_02]: it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little brown cap on the top that
you can spin and it changes the flow rates
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the moisture level that the system
turns on and off at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're doing now is we kind of
built a station here at our office where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able to set them here ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the visually here, it's like we will
set them and then we put a cap on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put this protective cap on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And underneath that, I'm gonna pop this
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Underneath that, we'll put a few marks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be a red mark and a blue mark
on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we can do now is when these
things come in the mail, all you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: do is soak the bottoms, screw the top on,
and it's going to be set to produce a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain moisture level at a particular
pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pressure on the back end of the
system, say it's kind of like the full
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure, like 12 to 15 PSI, if you keep
it right at this point, this blue mark
[SPEAKER_02]: here, lined up with this fin piece,
if you keep it at the blue mark,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna hit a certain moisture level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's about where you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're running it off of gravity,
so you only have one to two PSI,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna move it closer to the red
mark on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've produced a chart that has kind
of all these corresponding values that
[SPEAKER_02]: represent the back end pressure,
where this dial should be set.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really just like a quarter turn
of the dial that you're ever gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: moving through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's kind of the new thing
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that allows us to do is send out
carrots for just a few plants in the
[SPEAKER_02]: basement or for hundreds or thousands of
plants in a facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each one of these carrots is gonna go
into each one of the containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're going to produce extremely
consistent results from container to
[SPEAKER_02]: container.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without any real dialing in process,
you're gonna hit extremely consistent
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture levels for every container in the
space, whether it's six or 600.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can then manipulate the
moisture levels just by changing the back
[SPEAKER_02]: end pressure on the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the pressure going into the system
is, say it's coming in at 15 PSI,
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything in the room is at like 40
millibars, and you wanna kind of dry that
[SPEAKER_02]: out to like 60 millibars as your low end,
you would just drop that back end pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: down to like seven PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's gonna automatically drop,
like change the moisture level of every
[SPEAKER_02]: pot or every container in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like a simple thing,
but it's really revolutionized the success
[SPEAKER_02]: for growers that are doing it,
because it takes the human error part on
[SPEAKER_02]: someone that's new to using blue mats just
right out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that human error part just kind of
becomes a much less of a factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it makes the whole systems way more
kind of plug and play.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get the kind of overwatering
that might have come or flooding or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that with setting the blue
mats incorrectly and getting overwatering
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been eliminated with this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then really just redesigning the water
distribution piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mentioned the drip rings,
we have them in a five inch and in a 10
[SPEAKER_02]: inch also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like anything up to like a five gallon
pot would go at the five inch,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then kind of your like 10 gallons up
to 30 gallons would go with one of these
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 inch rings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So pairing one of the carrots with one of
these drip rings per container is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a great way to be really,
really consistent and give good water
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution, nice and even moisture
levels in the soil, and then have them
[SPEAKER_02]: operating within those moisture ranges
that we were talking about, like a
[SPEAKER_02]: narrower wetter band during veg and then
during flower, a little bit more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: swing of wet dry overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I mean, I would say, I would say
that's like a big advancement.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've assembled a new pump kit that we
just started releasing like two months
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: People might have seen them, they have a
nice blue tank and a pump integrated right
[SPEAKER_02]: on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it comes with this adjustable pressure
reducer, which is a new product that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated into the system so that you can
again adjust that backend pressure of the
[SPEAKER_02]: system just at one place.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the pressure reducer itself has a dial
on it that you can turn and drop the
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure and watch the pressure drop on
your pressure gauge that's mounted on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that new pump kit, with the
adjustable pressure reducer, with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pre-dialed carrots and the drip rings for
pots or our manifold beds, or with the
[SPEAKER_02]: soaker hose for raised beds, this system,
we've taken like, we've done like so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different systems that are experimental
and like, maybe we're gonna try it like
[SPEAKER_02]: this, we're gonna try it like this,
what's working.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel, after hammering away at this stuff
for six or seven years now, we've gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: to a place where we have a really awesome
kind of line of really simple designs that
[SPEAKER_02]: are scalable and consistent with what
they're gonna deliver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're actually like in the process of
like revamping our website right now so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can, we're gonna have at
sustainablevillage.com, there'll be a
[SPEAKER_02]: build your own blue mat system and a page
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not quite functional yet as we're
recording this, but I'm hoping in a couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of weeks it will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the smaller systems, you know,
for up to like a 10 by 10 growth space,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could go in there really easily and
customize your own system and just order
[SPEAKER_02]: it right online without even really having
to talk to anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're gonna get a package in the mail
that has everything you need from pumps to
[SPEAKER_02]: supply lines to the carrots themselves and
the water distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of like suite of technology
and services we've been working on for
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much consistently since the last
time we talked two years ago on this show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And has gotten to a point where we ran
through like a year of pilot programs with
[SPEAKER_02]: home growers and commercial facilities,
gotten feedback, made some adjustments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have, like I said, that kind of
like the suite of products and designs and
[SPEAKER_02]: tech to give people like an awesome
experience from irrigation perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, like I'm a water nerd and a
irrigation guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, it's really exciting,
especially to take like, take problem
[SPEAKER_02]: points that were like, man, these are,
this is the real pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And put those into, you really solve those
pain points and get a design out that's
[SPEAKER_02]: easy and makes people successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gonna result in, you know,
significant yield increases and healthier
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and way more free time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the innovation you were talking
about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it definitely sounds like it
makes things easier for the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And less mistakes happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know a lot of people who get
the blue mats and just dialing it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's that little tinkering that needs to
get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tricky for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a preset blue mat is pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a question in regards to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I know the answer to it,
but I'm still gonna ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have it dialed in,
it's preset.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's watering your plant as it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add in say microbes,
for example, say I have like a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon or half gallon of water and you
just pour it right onto the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to make that medium more
moist, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna lower the millibars,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is it going to throw off the preset
blue mat or is it gonna dry back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: certain range that it's in as far as
moisture level?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, you're answering your own
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not throw off the preset blue mat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like your question is about liquid
inputs and it's really, really common way
[SPEAKER_02]: to do things is to run clean water through
the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you want to do a liquid input,
like a compost tea drench or just a
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient drench or anything like that,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's no problem at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll just, you will bring the moisture
level down or it'll become more wet for a
[SPEAKER_02]: short amount of time, but the blue mat
will just turn off and it'll stay off
[SPEAKER_02]: until it dries back to its trigger point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trigger point is really about when
does the blue mat turn on and then when
[SPEAKER_02]: does it turn off?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, it doesn't affect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the short answer there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're, you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also talked about PSI and I
know there's some folks that are hooking
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to their spigot, for example,
and they're doing it like you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor setup and they have a pressure
reducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're dialing in that PSI to 15 or
whatever they set it to, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of folks are growing indoors and
they're just doing the gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're hooked up to a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't really have control over
that PSI in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in our last episode we talked about,
you had mentioned that when you're setting
[SPEAKER_00]: those blue mats, it's best to have your
reservoir half full and then dial it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when it lowers, you're kind of
getting less pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you increase the amount that's in
the reservoir, that's a different pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, will that throw off the preset blue
mats to the folks that are doing gravity
[SPEAKER_00]: fed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they have their reservoir half full
then install the preset blue mats or does
[SPEAKER_00]: that not matter anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, it's preset.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what you do there, cause exactly
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause really what you're doing for your
water source, when you look at your water
[SPEAKER_02]: source, you have a few different options.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can either come right off of a
pressurized water source, like a hose bib
[SPEAKER_02]: and go straight into a pressure reducer
and knock that down to 15 PSI,
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere from 15 to two PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use a pump kit when I like a
pre-assembled pump kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's basically going to do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to create a constant water
sources under constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Run that through another pressure reducer
or through a pressure reducer and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: hit that same consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's going to create a constant water
resistance level or you can achieve that
[SPEAKER_02]: constant pressure with gravity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the calculation for that is one PSI
equals 2.31 feet of vertical head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for every 2.31 feet of vertical
elevation that the water is above the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface, that's one PSI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd like to see about two PSI to get
good uniform operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will function closer to one PSI,
but I'd like to see two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for your five feet, four to five feet
of head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can just do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a popular thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We send out these bucket kits.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use a plastic tote from Home Depot
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drill a little hole in it and put a
little bulkhead in it and then run off
[SPEAKER_02]: that and have your supply line creating
that kind of constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the preset carrots goes,
I'll pop this top off again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, there's a blue mark on it and
there's a red mark on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are all in relation to this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a plastic fin right there on the
top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when your back end pressure is
higher, like off a pressure reducer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to put it towards that blue
mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's drier or when the lower
pressure, like a two PSI, like off a
[SPEAKER_02]: gravity, you're just going to want to turn
that to the red mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, these things come with
this plastic cap snapped over the top as
[SPEAKER_02]: protective cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's actually a little key that we
have now, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have one sitting here,
but there's a little key that inserts into
[SPEAKER_02]: this hole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can just turn it and you just
move that between the blue and the red to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that without having to remove the cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you are running a gravity
system, they're going to come set at the
[SPEAKER_02]: blue mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're running the gravity,
you just adjust it so that the red mark is
[SPEAKER_02]: lining up with that plastic fin piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some really nice, you know,
kind of like infographic style
[SPEAKER_02]: instructions that go along with this that
will show how to manipulate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also a chart that's part of it,
too, that'll show, you know, you look at
[SPEAKER_02]: your back end pressure and the moisture
levels you want to hit and then where to
[SPEAKER_02]: adjust it within that range between the
red and the blue mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, that's for gravity systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would just move it towards the red
mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it sounds like it makes things
a lot easier for the home grower and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: all about easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to see if I can get my hands
on on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other advancements in irrigation
technology do you anticipate in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're doing with the blue mats and
we do this with other things, too,
[SPEAKER_02]: and other people do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that kind of that sort of holy grail
of irrigation is is raw about plant demand
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using some sort of sensor to trigger
irrigation events.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, that's really happening with
the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that the place where the blue
mat isn't as effective is in large scale
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor applications because some of the
flow rates involved, some of the materials
[SPEAKER_02]: involved are a little more prone to UV
degradation or they get chewed up by
[SPEAKER_02]: animals and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody that's growing outdoors,
we have strategies for coping with all of
[SPEAKER_02]: that if they're in containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in direct soil, like native
soil applications, things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: the blue mats aren't necessarily the best
choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I see just the evolution of
sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's like all kinds of
different moisture sensors out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether the volumetric ones or tensiometer
based ones or there's a third kind called
[SPEAKER_02]: solid matrix sensors, which are a type of
tensiometers that are used in clay soils,
[SPEAKER_02]: like clay based soils like you would use
outside in a large scale field or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, some of the stuff I'm excited
about is like completely not related to
[SPEAKER_02]: that indoor industry that we've been
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more like in the regenerative ag
space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I design systems using a product called
Kifka water reels.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're these large water guns that can
water anywhere from like one to 60 acres
[SPEAKER_02]: at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a larger amount of space,
right, in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not as large as like a center
pivot irrigation piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, this is just a pet project of
mine that I'm working on with some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: people in the regenerative ag community.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, when you fly over the United
States or anywhere and you see all the
[SPEAKER_02]: center pivots, so you look down at the
field and you see these large circles
[SPEAKER_02]: where then they have brown in the corners
where they're not growing anything,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the center pivots are just like,
that's what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a giant sprinkler that just like
operates on a big boom arm and spins
[SPEAKER_02]: around in a circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leaves these corners of the
fields uncultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, something I'm just kind of
getting kicked off is like a side project
[SPEAKER_02]: on my own is irrigating those corners and
putting those into regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural practices that can be
ecosystems and native habitats for
[SPEAKER_02]: pollinators and for plants and animals
that will benefit the larger ecosystems
[SPEAKER_02]: and even the monocrops that are being
grown there.
[SPEAKER_02]: For carbon sequestration, all these sort
of like the benefits of regenerative ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a ton of, there's like just
thousands and thousands of acres of land
[SPEAKER_02]: out there that's not being used because
they can't hit them with those center
[SPEAKER_02]: pivots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we're putting together some designs to
irrigate the corners, the corners of the
[SPEAKER_02]: fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's kind of outside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I'm excited about as a
designer and someone that's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, passionate about regenerative ag
in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then, you know, and then in the
controlled environment space, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it's just the evolution of sensors.
[SPEAKER_02]: The drip irrigation companies that we work
with, like Iritech, Rivulus, Netafim,
[SPEAKER_02]: those kind of companies, you know,
they're all producing some new technology
[SPEAKER_02]: in drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it's, you know, it's not super
innovative, but there's some new stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that comes out periodically and they get
better quality products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, kind of cool to see that come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I think like the sensors and the
data that's produced and a lot of that's
[SPEAKER_02]: now being integrated with like,
you know, cloud-based technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you'll have like Irometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Irometer makes a tensiometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's similar to the Blumet digital
moisture meter, but that you can connect
[SPEAKER_02]: it back to this hub that has a SIM card in
it and that shoots up data to a cloud.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can go on your browser and see
like real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not really real time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give it, it's like every hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: They give a data set, but you can see
historical moisture data for a field or
[SPEAKER_02]: you can put them indoors too and see that
over time in your indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, just collecting more and more
data and getting more sophisticated with
[SPEAKER_02]: the application of water and nutrients so
that we're never using too much and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: never over-watering or over-fertilizing to
kind of create healthy soils and
[SPEAKER_02]: ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moisture level, having the data for
that kind of reminds me of the EcoWit
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if you're familiar with that one
or not, but that one basically connects to
[SPEAKER_00]: an app and it gives you that display right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have multiple, all see it
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that would be really cool
and maybe this already exists and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about it, but what if that was
connected to like a Blumet for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you could set on your app what
moisture level you wanted and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: would adjust automatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: EcoWit is a volumetric water sensor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's measuring that percentage of
water in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, if you have done enough of
the math and kind of calculations to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can strategize your irrigation events
based on those numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to like be more familiar with the
soil types and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know those are really popular
and I think people have good results with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're kind of on the lower end of the
spectrum of like sensitivity and
[SPEAKER_02]: functionality and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some other brands like a taro
sensor or this one called Aclima.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are like kind of more higher end
lab grade ones that give really specific
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's exactly how a lot of growers
will do crop steering within like hydro
[SPEAKER_02]: systems if they're in rockwool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll have like those, they're prongs
and they'll have a volumetric water sensor
[SPEAKER_02]: in the rockwool and it's giving,
once it hits a certain trigger point,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll open a solenoid valve and it'll
irrigate every piece of rockwool and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll up to a certain point and then it'll
turn itself off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that does, that tech is out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that there's a lot of people doing
some really cool stuff and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: building better systems, better sensors,
better platforms for like looking at that
[SPEAKER_02]: information and hooking it up to the water
distribution system itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we've seen some cool things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, you know, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm more of an ag-minded irrigation
guy anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I try to go towards simplicity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that growers have created
technology problems for themselves that
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't necessarily need by like
getting too complex with some of those
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, if you have the bandwidth
and the budget to implement that sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: thing, it can be really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you and it's kind
of funny sometimes here and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: people on both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, oh, hand watering,
be with the plants, know the plants versus
[SPEAKER_00]: automation and kind of be hands off and be
in the garden less, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So whichever way you decide to go about
it, that's up to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I overall think it's exciting to see this
technology in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a person who would actually
implement it in my garden without losing
[SPEAKER_00]: touch with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love getting in there and
breathing on the plants, giving them some
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh CO2, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But now good stuff, a lot to look forward
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you coming on today for the
second time.

[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend you guys go check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's upaya garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So U-P-A-Y-A garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got really, he's just taking the R&D,
Blue Mat thing to a new level.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I would check out some of those
sites.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Blue Mat watering systems,
Upaya gardens, and sustainablevillage.com
[SPEAKER_02]: are kind of the best ways to find us.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as upcoming events, I don't have a
lot on the calendar right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been, we're pretty, pretty locked
into the office right now doing design
[SPEAKER_02]: work at springtime and, you know,
just keeping the business humming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of that's happening here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody's in the, you know,
front range of Colorado, and they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: stop by and say, hi, we'd love to see you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's always welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure about a future events at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely we'll be going back to the soil
life summit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once they announce a new event,
we'll probably hit a few trade shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always do the Colorado farm show every
year, but it's not till January.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, where to find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to you down

[SPEAKER_00]: For coming on again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time flew by.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe how quickly this time flew
by here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anytime, you know, I love talking
about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much and hope you enjoy the
rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate it, Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
