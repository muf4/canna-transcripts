[SPEAKER_01]: How about your daily routine?
[SPEAKER_01]: How has that changed having from basically
no equipment to having top of the line
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more stressless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a word or term,
but yeah, I hand water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a thing that I still haven't
figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I feel like I can
leave town for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can leave town for like two,
three days, especially like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in soil, you have a two day in
between watering most of the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with like the medium I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to water every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm in flower, I might have to
water every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I feel like growing in soil and
with the controller to hook it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to Disneyland and you want to
go to Florida, visit your family or things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, still look at my stuff to see
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any body in town, you can have
them go do what you see going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I was kind of just like scrambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I was the only one that could
fix any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't go out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way like nobody knows my
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what can be fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's kind of like I want to say
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's like the new like
automated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it helps me control myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been saying this time a lot with my
friend and I talk about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like full control.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to like companies growing autos
or anybody that grows autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't personally right now because I
really like the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how many days of veg I can
go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If plan just decides to do what it wants
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how many like if right now
I have one gallons in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know that I have this many one
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always going to put the bare minimum
at developing 28, you know, at the lowest.
[SPEAKER_00]: 28 at the weight of each one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to, you know, am I going to
high up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know how many I have, I know how many
that can develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with the auto, you can never really
calculate or predict those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: With photo periods and having a system
that is controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: That word control becomes so much more
like you can control every single thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when it comes to like cutting clones,
you kind of can control how many days the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a little bit of it is hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you know what you're doing,
you can really control it.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that controller, like you
mentioned, where you can basically go into
[SPEAKER_01]: an app on your phone and be able to not
only see what your conditions are,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can control the different pieces
of equipment through there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt the same way when I went to like
the AC Infinity system using their app
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of kind of being blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent so many years without that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is kind of nervous leaving town
because you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just hope that your plants are going
to be good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hope that the environment conditions
are going to be solid, that the lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to turn on like it should and
turn off like it should, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's definitely a huge game
changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before you guys came, I was having a
problem with my lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using the old spin wheel timers and,
you know, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I winded back my timer to where
somehow it was a couple more hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: light than it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't turn off or cut back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally things were starting to
revetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything had to be revetched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, like every nut, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't able to catch that because
during those times it was out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to open that door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, there's no way I don't need to
go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I have the controller,
I don't really have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say if you are new to the
controller at all and you're setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: the controller by hand, I don't think
anybody should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use the app because there's
like the left and right button sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: will change settings that you don't even
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your lights might cut back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to change that is in the
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that happen to two different
people I've seen on Instagram and I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally mentioned to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that was the thing,
but yeah.
