[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the hierarchy of needs of IPM,
the big chunk of that is the first layer,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that defensive layer, those passive
approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a certain point, you know,
it gets diluted just from humidity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air, and it ends up just being a basin of
a virus rather than a sterilizing basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or just general stunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reduces yields by up to 55% in some
cases, and it's really devastating some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these industries where it's hopped over
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a few days of dry soil,
you can damage them, and then do that over
[SPEAKER_01]: the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a handful of days where the
soil is really dry, it'll really damage
[SPEAKER_01]: that population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important to start off with a
holistic approach to gardening in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: and pest management in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 83.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Simon Kepchar,
the founder and CEO of Interlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a significant amount of knowledge
when it comes to pest management,
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses, and viroids, and that's what
we're going to get into in today's
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Vivosun for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivosun recently released the Smart Grow
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smart Grow system helps streamline the
growing process by automating stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth requirements, on and off schedules,
spectral range, airflow and circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even records useful data about your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Wi-Fi capable and connects to the
Vivosun app, so you can control your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space from your smartphone.

[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different series LED grow
lights, the ion board and the ion grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ion board fixtures are board style and
use Samsung LM301B diodes, while the ion
[SPEAKER_00]: grid series has an open center design and
uses Samsung LM301H diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link in the description

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Simon from
Interlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super pumped on what we have to talk
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about some pests
and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a ton of experience in regards to
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get deep into the topics,
can you do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you said, I'm Simon Kepchar,
currently with Interlight, which is a new
[SPEAKER_01]: next-gen crop protection company that I'm
the founder of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for years, for most of my life,
I've been very interested in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out with permaculture,
organic gardening, food forests,
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But later in my life, I started to do IPM
consulting for just general agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: out here in Colorado, which led me to
eventually develop the Interlight
[SPEAKER_01]: technology and see if we can push crop
protection into the future a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of people that are
beginners that tune into my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not know what IPM is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start off with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is IPM and what IPM methods do you
use in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I think IPM is perfect for
beginners because it's really important to
[SPEAKER_01]: start off with a holistic approach to
gardening in general and pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So IPM stands for Integrated Pest
Management.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means rather than the sort of
historic approach where we plant a field,
[SPEAKER_01]: we say, we know we're going to get pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just going to wait until eventually
we see a massive infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll go head to head and fight
it with some powerful chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: With IPM, Integrated Pest Management,
we prepare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we look at all of the methods that we
have at our disposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we use them in advance to an
infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prepare.
[SPEAKER_01]: We scout.
[SPEAKER_01]: We identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of, in IPM, you build a
hierarchy of requirements for fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start with general protective
measures, sort of defensive strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start with, let's have standard
operating procedures to have really clean
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have resistant crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not necessarily, if we can,
let's not do a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have multiple crops in our fields or
in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we look at sort of a higher level
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's keep our eyes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's learn how to identify pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's learn how to scout our garden
and make sure that we see any signs of
[SPEAKER_01]: infestations early so that we can fight
them sort of passively and not have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this massive battle against an existing
infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of IPM approaches,
I really recommend what you first need to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is you need to lay out and understand
all possible strategies that you have at
[SPEAKER_01]: your disposal, how they synergize with one
another, and how they perhaps have
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-synergies with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can really pick and choose what you
need to deploy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these include defensive things like
just building up physical barriers,
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting your crops if you're indoors,
sealing a grow environment, to things like
[SPEAKER_01]: traps, foot baths, sterilization,
keeping things clean, all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: active crop protection techniques like
obviously the spraying and application of
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals, the introduction of beneficial
pests or beneficial insects, and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like that, even to higher
technology like intralight light
[SPEAKER_01]: treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what techniques do you use in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a little bit biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mainly use the intralight technology
that I've been developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use that in combination with just
what I consider standard operating
[SPEAKER_01]: practices of quarantining the environment
off, cordoning it off from the general
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to be in control of what
comes in and out of your garden if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I have an indoor little
vertical farm where I mainly garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's easy for me to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say if I was still doing an
outdoor garden, I would do a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: approach where I just try to lock it down
as much as I can through physical
[SPEAKER_01]: barriers, layers of diatomaceous earth,
and just proactive passive approaches so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't have to go in and attack an
infestation so you can just prevent it
[SPEAKER_01]: from ever happening or identify it early.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those really include traps,
barriers, passive systems like
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials, beneficial biologics,
and in my case, the intralight solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the intralight a little bit
because people hear in that and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what the heck is intralight?
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a light, right, where it's basically
shining onto your plant or your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually, is it killing off pests
entirely?
[SPEAKER_01]: So intralight's a radical new approach to
crop protection technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way that I think, the most
intuitive way to understand it is to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: why is it that insects in particular are
always on the underside of your leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're not, when we look for
signs of infestation, we may see stippling
[SPEAKER_01]: on the top of a leaf and then we flip it
over and we see a bunch of spider mites or
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids or thrips or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it that they're living on the
underside of leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason is because they're protecting
themselves from harmful rays of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the same rays of the sun that
would cause us to have skin cancer after
[SPEAKER_01]: being exposed to the sun for many decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, intralight focuses those,
the specific parts of the spectrum that
[SPEAKER_01]: are pesticidal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we attenuate them and modulate them
and send them targeted at the insects and
[SPEAKER_01]: at pathogens at a very specific intensity
and dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows us to damage the DNA of pests
and pathogens without harming the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This DNA damage builds up and will
eventually collapse their population or
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them below economically impactful
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously I am biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try not to just show for intralight
too much, but I do believe that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: highly effective crop protection
technology and it sort of eliminates the
[SPEAKER_01]: need for ammunition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have these chemicals
constantly being applied or you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: have these beneficials constantly being
applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intralight is just a one time purchase
where you don't need to continually supply
[SPEAKER_01]: it, which synergizes with these IPM
approaches where in the hierarchy of needs
[SPEAKER_01]: of IPM, the big chunk of that is the first
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that defensive layer, those passive
approaches, um, which just prevent you
[SPEAKER_01]: from having to use these extreme
approaches, uh, like direct chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have like a full blown
infestation, how quickly will the
[SPEAKER_00]: intralight kind of kill off that
population?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on the life cycle of the,
the, of the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, most of their life cycles are
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we're dealing in DNA damage,
it's not likely that we'll kill,
[SPEAKER_01]: we won't kill an insect exposed to the
intralight pesticidal spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we'll do is tear up their DNA and
reduce their ability to reproduce,
[SPEAKER_01]: hatch or mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sort of depends, like if,
if, if we were dealing with something that
[SPEAKER_01]: had a multi-year lifespan, it would,
it would take years for us to collapse the
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because we're dealing with something
that has a few day lifespan, or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: parts of its life cycle that's measured in
days or weeks, it's pretty easy for us to
[SPEAKER_01]: collapse populations within seven to 14
days for things like spider mites and
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids and, uh, in general and thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to intralight
website down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said, uh, you know,
you didn't want to make this whole video
[SPEAKER_00]: about like a sales pitch for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good thing because my audience would
sniff that out and call that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty funny when it comes to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it is, it's just, uh, I have to sort
of edit it out when I think of what is
[SPEAKER_01]: your most effective, uh, IPM solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say, okay, let's, let's not,
let's not talk about intralight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are many tried and true crop
protection technologies outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: intralight, uh, that I'm definitely a huge
proponent of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I love me some diatomaceous
earth love neem oil that, uh, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: spaghetti squash smell of some neem
freshly sprayed neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm all for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And later on in this episode, we will get
into some of the pests that you could face
[SPEAKER_00]: in your garden and how to tackle them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, first I do want to get into more
of like the viroids viruses, pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: that are around and doing some damage to
people's crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into that, I know one of
the main things that kind of spread
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses and viroids is not cleaning tools
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do want to get into detail about the
proper cleaning of tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll get into the viruses and
viroids and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the best way to actually clean
your tools or sanitize your tools?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimmers, for example, that's one of the
things that a lot of people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've heard as simple as just wiping it
down with isopropyl alcohol and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people say that that's not effective
and that you should actually be using
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen peroxide in a soak for a certain
period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about the best way to clean and
sanitize tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the actual ranking of
hydrogen peroxide, alcohol solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach, bleach solution, they're all
highly effective at killing viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is just what does,
you know, you have to imagine that tool is
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its surface is covered in really virulent
viruses that can, in some cases they can
[SPEAKER_01]: last on there for multiple months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while wiping it down is very effective,
the question is, you know, are you wiping
[SPEAKER_01]: down 10 sets of trimming scissors?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you sort of going quickly on the
last one and missing those crevices?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why an actual soak can be more
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one, the thing with soaks that I
really find people fall behind in is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's easy to, you might have this like jar
of alcohol or this basin of alcohol that
[SPEAKER_01]: you soak your tools in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people will just leave the same
thing of a container of alcohol or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever sterilizing agent they have,
they'll just leave it there for multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: days and they'll reuse it and reuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a certain point, you know,
it gets diluted just from humidity in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air and it ends up just being a basin of a
virus rather than a sterilizing basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that a short soak is
probably the most effective solution in
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're most comfortable with or
whatever's most readily available to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: bleach solution, alcohol solution,
or hydrogen peroxide solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend a brief soak and then
removing them from that basin,
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaning them, and then regularly
refreshing that basin, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, but at least every couple of
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we see this in large scale greenhouses
and large scale warehouse, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor grows where they have a foot basin
that everyone steps in to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to sterilize their shoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's sort of an easy thing
to fall behind on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing a bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the last thing that you think
of is, Oh, I need to refill that foot
[SPEAKER_01]: basin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after a week, it becomes the
spreader of pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just important to be on top of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how often should people be
cleaning their tools?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people do it after every cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people only doing it after each
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately it's really, really
regularly, really, really consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not each cut, but it's each plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when we're dealing with these
viruses, they're transferring from one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to another through just physical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's virus in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's now on your scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you cut the next plant,
you're infecting that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not every cut when you're on one
plant, but between two plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should clean your tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be just a quick, but
effective, thorough wiping, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as, you know, even just changing
your gloves and being very careful,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a way to helpfully understand
how serious and how long lasting these
[SPEAKER_01]: virus parts can be consider tobacco mosaic
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are cases where all of these
standard operating procedures are in
[SPEAKER_01]: place, but a worker goes outside and
smokes a cigarette and on in that
[SPEAKER_01]: cigarette living after, you know,
years of drying is a tobacco mosaic virus
[SPEAKER_01]: that gets on their hands and then
contaminates, um, the tobacco grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's very virulent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say be overly, uh, overly
cautious.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one last question on,
cleaning tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get into that nitty gritty of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your tremors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, you soak it in hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when you take those tremors
out, are you going right in for the next
[SPEAKER_00]: cut or are you like wiping it down with
like a paper towel or some sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: towel?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would wipe it down with a towel,
but you have to be careful to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you have the same towel that
you're using over and over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to just be spreading,
continually spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say if, if it was just me
personally, I'm taking a hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: full of cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a relatively small number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, five to 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, why don't you just have two
or three sets of scissors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take some cuts, soak it for the 10 or
15 minutes while you're taking a next set
[SPEAKER_01]: of cuts with a fresh pair of scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can switch it out, take them out
of the hydrogen peroxide, wipe them down
[SPEAKER_01]: with a clean wipe and with fresh gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're very sure that you're
clean from, um, from any viruses being
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but of course there are ways to simply
in, uh, insulate your plants from ever
[SPEAKER_01]: being infected by viruses as they're
mechanically transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can sort of, uh, if you were to
test, if you're cloning, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would be able to test your mothers and
determine we're free of viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could sort of, uh,
be a little bit, uh, a little bit safer,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, without doing these really intense
cleaning regimens, as long as you're on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of what is coming in and out of your,
uh, your grow or your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some viroids and viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with hop latent viroid
disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, hop latent viroid, or,
uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: H P L V D.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, the, the, uh, acronyms are
getting a little bit long at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, basically this is a virus that
was probably sitting around in hops for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, who knows many, many decades in
hops, as the name implies, it's latent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't cause any symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sits around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just an asymptomatic carrier,
but, uh, recently hopped over,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, sorry for the pun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It moved over from hops to the very close,
uh, genetic, uh, closely related species.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, newly deregulated medicinal
plants where it hopped over and it
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated those, uh, those crops where
it is not simply latent virus anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is very damaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes, uh, what's called dudding or
just general stunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it reduces yields by, you know,
up to 55% in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really devastating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these industries where it's hopped
over to, uh, apologies again for the puns,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, this is something that really
came out of the blue around half a decade
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was not good standard operating
procedures to protect against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time it was noticed,
it was all across North America,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, causing these serious economic harms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we, this is why IPM is such an
important thing for everyone to take into
[SPEAKER_01]: account and why you've got to look at
these systems holistically, because if we
[SPEAKER_01]: were using an IPM mindset, we would be
prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we would say, Oh, well,
it hasn't come into my grow yet because I
[SPEAKER_01]: look at this basic layer of defense and I
say, well, if I invest in that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I don't have to deal with these
huge, huge costs of fighting something
[SPEAKER_01]: like this after it comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those cleaning techniques that you
mentioned a little while ago, that'll help
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or resolve the issue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're doing cuts on a plant that
has hoplite and viral disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they go ahead and do that,
soak, wipe off the trimmers, go to their
[SPEAKER_00]: next plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should not have spread to the next
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't spread over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, uh, the, the real issue is
bringing in a clone and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this, we know we need to grow this
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you grow that mother and then all
of its, uh, all of its subsequent
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring have this virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's just increasing the
likelihood that it's going to be spread
[SPEAKER_01]: from one plant to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But crucially, these viruses are spread
mechanically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spread physically.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case of, uh, like tobacco mosaic,
it can be literally leaves rubbing against
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily hoplite and virus isn't
necessarily that virulent, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important to note when we're discussing
this, this is very, a very new virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, you know, five years ago was
last detected, you know, three years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really began being studied.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't necessarily know 100% on some
of these things, but it is physically
[SPEAKER_01]: transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so you can prevent that through
standard operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could certainly be on clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've heard it can also be on seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true or not true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly it's, it's debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another thing that we don't really
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anecdotally, it's certainly had,
there's an idea that it's spread on seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's clear that if it can be on
any surface, obviously it can be on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there is some research showing that it
will not actually be in the seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, from the pollinating plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if the pollinating plant had the
virus, um, but the plant that's being
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated and is growing the seeds
doesn't have the virus, then it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be transferred in the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but obviously if that seed is grown
within, uh, a virally infected plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is going to be at least coded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there are things that we can do to
fight this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can, uh, clean our seeds and we can
heat or, or freeze the seeds to kill this
[SPEAKER_01]: virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a, you know, it's been related
to a sort of a chemotherapy approach where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, this is a, this is a harmful
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it can cause a cause a lot of
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it can certainly be spread by the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why it's kind of a
frightening, frightening thing to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk a little bit deeper about the
cleaning of the seeds that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, uh, two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you clean the seeds and then heat the
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, um, heat or cool them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually been some tests on,
you know, can we take a plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: infested with this virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we just heat it up a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we cool it down a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we just kill off the virus?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same approach, um, that our
bodies would take when infested with a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We would get a fever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would raise our body temperature to a
place where that virus wouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: live now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the instances of these crops,
these heating levels have been,
[SPEAKER_01]: have caused like 50% kill rates,
um, in the plants themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really severe levels of heat
that's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in, in, in seeds, it's a little bit
easier to just freeze them, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not damage them too badly,
but these effects are always going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of harmful, kind of last minute
resorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could do a seed soak and like a
very slight, you know, a seed wipe with a
[SPEAKER_01]: very slight bit of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, these are, you're sort of
coming close to the line of damaging these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's best just to start with non-infected
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you detect hoplite and viroid
diseases?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like testing that can be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there physical characteristics that
somebody could see on the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine whether they have it or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they realize they have it,
how do they get rid of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in terms of testing, it's a really
laboratory test.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of testing, it's actually a PCR
test, a polymerase chain reaction test.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the same test that we learned
about a lot over COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, luckily because we've experienced this
pandemic, not, you know, not that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a, you know, it was a terrible,
terrible event for all of humanity,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was very educational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and now we understand a little bit
more about how sneaky viruses can be and
[SPEAKER_01]: how difficult they can be to fight and how
we need to just instead prevent them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of detecting them,
there are asymptomatic, um, plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: will just be spreaders that you can only
determine if you're actually taking a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of taking a flight, a tissue sample and
sending it to a lab to be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the symptomatic plants,
you will be able to, to identify them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is a little bit more tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and really you need to be experienced
with it to quickly identify it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, it's stunting and what's called
dudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, it's sort of similar
to an overwatering reaction where this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant just looks unhappy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very brittle stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, uh, sort of, there's an excess
splaying of leaves or of stems,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's just general, very slow
growth, um, and very, very reduced growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, it's unfortunate because
there's, um, some people who you might go
[SPEAKER_01]: in and say, Hey, you're just a bad
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just doing bad here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants looking happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, Oh, I don't know what to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying my best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's, well, maybe you have a,
this full infestation that you haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to test, but it just shows up as
stunting and, you know, 50% reductions in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in yield and things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really the main, uh,
the main sign is stunted plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have, you know, a couple of plants
and one of them is just looking really sad
[SPEAKER_01]: and stunted, I would consider being very
careful around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you have the means, send off a
tissue sample for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also you can just test all mothers
is really the thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a recommended lab that they
should send the tissue samples to and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much does that cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a specific lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any, any testing lab is going to be able
to pretty easily do these tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's, it's not super expensive,
but the thing is, you know, it's less than
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred dollars per, uh, each tissue
sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, you know, in a large
operation, you might have, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might have dozens or hundreds of
tissue samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where it becomes
problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to tomato Brown Rougros
fruit virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I pronounce that one right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rougos Rougos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the, uh, uh, T O B R F V the really
the acronym that it's getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: silly and we need to just, just,
we can just call it Rougos virus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, be another, another virus,
very similar to the story of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hoplite and viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one that we're not sure where
it came from, but it occurred,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, around half a decade ago in Jordan and
Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a pepper and tomato, uh, greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes, you know, a lot of die-off,
a lot of really bad reductions in yield
[SPEAKER_01]: for both tomatoes and peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's precisely the same in terms of
the way that it spreads as, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: as hoplite and virus or as a tobacco
mosaic virus, that is mechanical transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can simply prevent it, um,
by identifying it early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: To identify it by site.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there have been some cases where
it's come over to the United States and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been found in places like California,
Arizona and Florida, but it's been locked
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've said, we have this, we're going to
cut down every plant in this greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to sterilize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to throw out the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to clean all of our tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And supposedly it's been contained in
those situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, kind of debatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably is floating around out
there, but it's a very serious concern,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, much like, uh, how hoplite and viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you do the similar testing that
you mentioned for hoplite and to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can send off a tissue sample to a
laboratory and pay a certain amount to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Precisely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, it's, we're fairly good at
testing for viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the, in the case of rugose,
it's a pretty apparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have your fruit be a yellowed
and have large lesions all over the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hence the Brown term, but,
uh, you also have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yellowing and die off of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little more, it's a little more
aggressive than the hoplite and viral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so it's easier to see earlier on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it is very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one thing to note is that we can,
there are situations where if we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: really crucial, uh, cultivar, uh,
you know, very specific strain of tomatoes
[SPEAKER_01]: that we really want to serve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really want to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've put in a lot of investment into
breeding it, uh, but it's infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and we have to kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, situations where you can find certain
tissue in that plant that is not infected,
[SPEAKER_01]: namely like very new growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you can take a little sample of
that and you can culture it, clone it
[SPEAKER_01]: through culturing, um, and save that
strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same with a hoplite and viral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no way of actually like nursing
it back to life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just be, it's infected with the
virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to kill it off unless you can get
some of that new growth tissue off of that
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a situation where you could
struggle through and accept a,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a 50% loss in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say you have to think about
the, the industry as a whole, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody else is going to be
pretty upset with you if you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you don't just destroy a, a tomato
greenhouse that's infested because it will
[SPEAKER_01]: be spreading to the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is what we see with tobacco mosaic
virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just endemic at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been dealing with it for a hundred
years and it's not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're at a point with, uh,
rugos for tomatoes where can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're still insulated here in America from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We conceivably, we can still perhaps
through really good operating practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent it, or at least hold it off for
many years until we can, uh, find a more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective way to actually fight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of curing a plant that's
infected with it, it's that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, perhaps these extreme hot and cold
therapies, but even then, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may just be slowing this down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned TMV a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to get a little bit deeper into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a brief explanation of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything more to say about like
what TMV is and kind of how to go about
[SPEAKER_00]: detecting it and preventing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'd say it's something really to
look to because these new viruses that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about in tomatoes and in
medicinal crops, these are less than half
[SPEAKER_01]: a decade old.
[SPEAKER_01]: The research has not been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the really quick identification has
not been developed yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, um, Mosaic virus is one
that you can look to and you can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's a century of research, you know,
dig into that and you, you can really,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can help you to prepare and you can
take those operating practices over,
[SPEAKER_01]: which really are what we've been talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just heavy sterilization
processes, careful sterilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the case of large tobacco crops,
it's, um, when the soil is infected with
[SPEAKER_01]: their contaminated soil and you can't just
throw it out because it's the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you do crop rotation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where a field will be fallow for up to two
years to actually really let that virus
[SPEAKER_01]: die off before you come back to that
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's, it's a very good,
uh, resource to look to, to sort of train
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and see what is this industry
done over a hundred years to deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: what is now an endemic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I imagine one of the easy ways to
prevent it is just not to smoke around
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is this only cigarettes or is it
anything else you smoke as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's these viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: These viruses are very, very virulent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're happy to live on the surfaces of
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, it's hard to understand,
but even in the case of when a plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: dried, you know, broken down, rolled up,
put in a cigarette and smoked later,
[SPEAKER_01]: there can still be one or two virus
particles on there that get on your hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: that get on your face and then you
transfer to your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would say it applies generally,
uh, beyond just tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something to watch out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that is not confirmed or
denied as or, but it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just best operating procedures to be
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made the mistake in the past of
confusing TMV with a variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, I apparently they look very
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is just a natural occurring thing in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is an actual virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any easier way to kind of,
you know, separate the two so people don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get confused?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say, you know, the variation
it's funny because it's actually a very
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable trait, even in some, um,
in a flora culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you get a breed of roses,
for example, with variegation,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make a pretty penny off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say it's, this is a holistic
approach where you say, okay, I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: this variegation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let's put it in the back of my mind and
maybe it's mosaic, but let's, let's wait
[SPEAKER_01]: until we see some other symptoms show up
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some stunting, if there's variegation and
stunting, you know, if there's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's variegation and lesions
occurring, um, or if it's very small,
[SPEAKER_01]: small modeled variegation, you know,
typical genetic variation will be like
[SPEAKER_01]: larger swaths of sort of lighter colored
versus darker colored mosaic will be
[SPEAKER_01]: really tight, tight, little, uh,
tight little differentiations in color,
[SPEAKER_01]: almost to the point of like stippling from
a bad spider manifestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's transition over into pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different pests that
gardeners can come across as they are on
[SPEAKER_00]: their journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of common ones that
come up more often than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that I have been battling so
much over the past 12 plus years,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, they are certainly a pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can rapidly increase the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do have a full blown
infestation, what can you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, such a frustrating pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really you're correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calling it a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally get so frustrated when I have
just gnats just buzzing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're incredibly frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this is an insect that
unlike other insects that thrive on the
[SPEAKER_01]: undersides of leaves, they're thriving
down in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're much harder to identify ahead
of time, much harder to actively treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do a root flush rather than
just spraying something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very, uh, they're very frustrating
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I would say this comes back to,
if you look at the pyramid of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, of priority, is for IPM when
you're at the bottom of the pyramid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the largest segment is just do
preventative passive maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that really comes into play
with fungus gnats because they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: species that thrive in wet soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, first of all, just really
proper drainage, which may be difficult in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cases of, um, rock wall cubes,
but really proper drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at things like air pots,
things like elevating pots and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or, um, the fabric pots, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then not, uh, not overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a drip irrigation system,
this is kind of impossible to avoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would really recommend that there's
some people who are very big proponents of
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing plants to fully dry before next
watering is applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the quick life cycle of,
um, of fungus gnats, like we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: with the intro light solution,
our best application, our most efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: application is when they're short life
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing with allowing roots to
really dry out, um, because there's such a
[SPEAKER_01]: quick life cycle of a fungus gnats that if
there's just a few days of dry soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can damage them and then do that over
the next, uh, over the next week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a handful of days where the
soil is really dry, it will really damage
[SPEAKER_01]: that population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned diatomaceous earth in
the past is one thing that you like to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that can definitely help do some
damage on the fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk deeper about diatomaceous
earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how much do you apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it actually do to the fungus
gnats?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, diatomaceous earth is a really
interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, uh, diatomaceous meaning
from diatoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really it's, it's a incredible thing
because this is a, a mineral, a sort of a
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral that's actually the skeletons of,
um, ancient little tiny creatures that
[SPEAKER_01]: have silica skeletons that are now just,
uh, huge sand deposits of fossils of
[SPEAKER_01]: ancient microorganisms that are
essentially incredibly spiky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microscopic balls of silica, silica,
obviously silica gel that you get in your
[SPEAKER_01]: shoe box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It absorbs water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the actual method of, uh, of the kill
method of diatomaceous earth is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pretty dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's a, it'll get stuck in
the joints of, um, an insect or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in, in the skin of, uh,
of a larva and those tiny little sharp
[SPEAKER_01]: corners will slice the skin or slice into
the creature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the silica naturally will suck
water out and just desiccate the creature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, but crucially, it's a physical
method of killing this insect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no, no kind of contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diatomaceous earth is totally okay to be
exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to inhale a ton of it,
but, um, there's some people will,
[SPEAKER_01]: will eat some of it, um, to supposedly
clean out, uh, parasites inside their own
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very safe for humans and it's
very easy to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of application rates for
something like, um, for someone like
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats, I would just use this as a
preventative, apply a thin layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: diatomaceous earth to the top of your soil
or to the top of your medium, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep an eye on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, as you water it,
it will get sort of moved around and
[SPEAKER_01]: knocked down into that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it looks like, you know,
there's not much left, go ahead and apply
[SPEAKER_01]: another thin layer just to, you don't need
to do a thick layer of diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're, if any insect walks
over it, it's going to be stuck in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are going to, they're going to
die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need some kind of really
thick layer of it, which is why it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: nice to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can use sort of a sprayer,
um, to apply it directly to leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've never really been a big fan of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, not super effective,
but if you did have a really big
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation, uh, you could do some little
dousing of diatomaceous earth to fight
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many different sprays
that can be used as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've used so much over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from hydrogen peroxide,
which apparently harms the larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, I tried bleach that didn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alcohol is another home remedy that you
read up online, but those things really
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't help me to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things that did help was Dr.
Zymes, which is like an all natural
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think it's just of essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be something else that had helped
reduce the population.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also recently picked up mammoth can
control, which is, uh, corn oil and a time
[SPEAKER_00]: oil that has greatly helped reduce the
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we could sit here and talk
about fungus gnats for the next 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: or really wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a ton of different solutions
that people can explore on preventing and
[SPEAKER_00]: battling fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to say that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly things like green cleaner and
those essential oil based ones are really
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're, if you feel like I need to
apply a spray, these other solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are situations in IPM
where the bottom of the pyramid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the passive results, they were effective
for awhile, but we've gone past them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the next layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can use sprays like those
essential oil sprays, insecticidal soaps
[SPEAKER_01]: that are sprays and are effective,
but they're not these horrific,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, avid or as a max, um,
more very serious pesticides that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: debatably a little bit dangerous to be
exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about spider mites?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about them next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are they, how do you
prevent them and how do you deal with a
[SPEAKER_00]: full blown infestation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spider mites for me are really one
that's like not terrible, terribly
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're really one that's like there
it's frustrating, but if you train your
[SPEAKER_01]: eye, you will see stippling like really
early on, and then you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: target those hotspots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if they occur past your initial levels
of defense, uh, you'll be able to target
[SPEAKER_01]: them quickly and eradicate them pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spider mites and typically we'll be,
we're talking about red spotted spider
[SPEAKER_01]: mites are really incredibly common pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you want to look out for for them
is, as I said, that's stippling and also
[SPEAKER_01]: their waste on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you look through your grow,
you want to note stippling is little
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow dots along the surface of the plant
of the surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the result of on the, on the
underside of spider mitre and aphid
[SPEAKER_01]: rasping away, sucking the moisture out of
that leaf in that spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll also might see a sort of a
sticky looking little shot of shiny,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, little dots around the leaves as well,
which will be an example of their,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, their waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing to note that's frustrating
about spider mites and that comes up a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: as well with thrips is that, um,
they do have the ability to asexually
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically they lay eggs and then males
come and fertilize the eggs and that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: they reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have sort of a secondary
mechanism where a non-fertilized egg can
[SPEAKER_01]: hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just only hatch into, I believe they
only hatch into males or they only hatch
[SPEAKER_01]: into females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure exactly which, but the
fertilized eggs are able to hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's a situation where if one
survives, you know, and it's a female,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to lay an egg, lay eggs and
continue to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would really say, um, you know,
one of the early defense layers is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, just physically protecting your
environment, quarantining.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the question is how are they
getting into your environment if it is
[SPEAKER_01]: carefully sealed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are a lot of situations where
it can't be fully sealed, but if it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor or a well-sealed greenhouse,
how are they coming in?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is either in clones or new
cultivars you're bringing in or really on
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we are the big vehicle that they
come in on, especially, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if your dog, you take your dog for a hike
and he's running around and then you come
[SPEAKER_01]: and pet him, it's, that is just,
that's the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would say having grow specific
clothes, you know, not going directly from
[SPEAKER_01]: a hike directly in to take care of things,
uh, just prevent them in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can talk about actively
fighting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sort of if we have to go up that next
stage of the pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a couple of things would be to
change the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about making it colder, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They thrive in hot environments,
making it more windy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's harder for them to actually
congregate around in your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's, it's windier predator mites as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk about them a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Predator mites are really excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen some situations where people
will say they want to have stippling,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they'll notice mites and they'll be
like, Oh, I'm infested.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this crazy thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, no, they're, those are
friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's helpful little bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So predatory mites, as well as obviously
the classic is ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the real, um, the one is a
Cucumus, um, mites is a, is a common one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's many species of special little
mites that you can get that will just,
[SPEAKER_01]: just really eat those up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is where we get into,
if you look at an IPM system and you say,
[SPEAKER_01]: here's everything that I have in my
disposal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you might say, okay, let's just throw
everything, throw everything we can at
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that comes into negative
synergies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are to deploy these beneficial,
uh, beneficial mites, you have to then
[SPEAKER_01]: stop deploying other, uh, other pesticides
that may well kill, uh, kill your
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial, uh, insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to what you were saying about
temperature and, um, humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing will be the case on your
predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll, they'll die or they'll be
reduced just as much if you have cold
[SPEAKER_01]: nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but really temperature control is such
a beneficial, like just passive way to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is sort of why we see in Northern
California, you would expect like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, these should be covered in,
in spider mites, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But often you have those really cold,
foggy mornings that come in and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: reduces their ability to reproduce really
drastically and naturally fights them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but certainly I'm a big fan of
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sort of the pyramid of IPM is like
just passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Defense and then scouting and active to
fit like sort of first stage active
[SPEAKER_01]: defense, which is I'm going to deploy
some, some spider mites and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a little more act or some,
some, uh, some beneficial mites or some
[SPEAKER_01]: ladybugs a little bit more active.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to deploy some insecticidal
soaps, some chemicals that I feel are
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then last resort, you know,
the tip of the pyramid is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use some, some debatably,
some, some pretty bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one thing I would note here is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think an often overlooked approach
to stopping something like spider mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not an approach that will work for
something like fungus gnats because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're living in the soil, but something
like for spider mites, you can use a bait
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which I think it's a really,
have you ever had experience with using a
[SPEAKER_01]: bait plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you gotta ask yourself,
like, if he, if the spider mite has a
[SPEAKER_01]: series of five different plants,
which ones is it going to go to first?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll typically target, you know,
just like we have a preferred fruit that
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go after spider mites have preferred
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of, um, plants that you
can use to specifically to attract them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're not going to consume
that plant, you can use really harsh
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can impregnate it with, uh,
chemicals that you would certainly not
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use for, uh, consuming the
produce, but you can just have it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: bait plant where the spider mites go there
and they get, uh, they consume some,
[SPEAKER_01]: some serious, uh, serious chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think bean plants are a really common
one for, uh, for spider mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just an often overlooked
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are concerned about like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to put something that
attracts pests into my, into my grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's an interesting approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, uh, if you don't want to, if you don't
want to go to spraying chemicals directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is interesting approach and
something that I assume that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't think of that they can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thanks for pointing that one out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go over thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are thrips?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you prevent them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you deal with an infestation if
it were to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a frustrating one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another that has the, um, the lack of,
uh, or the ability to asexually reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's such a great defense mechanism
that they have where they just,
[SPEAKER_01]: their non-fertilized eggs will still
reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thrips are one that just, I've had
really frustrating experiences with thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: where they just refuse to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it can be a bit overblown if
you have one to two thrips and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping that population down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be a big issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as incredibly harmful as other
insects, but if a population grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: they are a serious harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say if a big population pops
up, you know, I would have, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have an intro light set up so that
it would be consistently damaging them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but say it got unplugged or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're going to need to actively,
uh, actively fight against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are, I would say beneficial
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can apply them, you know,
they're very easily targeted, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: by various predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a green lace wings will just have a
field day, especially if you take care of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're aware that you're growing your
crops, but you're also growing your green
[SPEAKER_01]: lace wings to fight thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you'll have a really good luck with,
uh, with the feeding them and those
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can't, I would move up to a
next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if you just can't get rid of these
thrips, I would consider, uh, one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that we haven't discussed is a pH
balancing of leaf surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go ahead and go in and either
spray with a sulfur or use a sulfur burner
[SPEAKER_01]: in a greenhouse, for example, or a larger
facility to just mess up the pH of the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of those leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can no longer, uh, can no longer
live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the other things that I would
look at is, you know, uh, insecticidal
[SPEAKER_01]: soaps, the things that we were discussing,
like essential oil concoctions,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make these yourself where you can
purchase them like green cleaner or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, uh, or, you know, trusting neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think, uh, these are, you might get
to a point where you don't want to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: really powerful chemicals, but you need to
physically apply a chemical, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: as effective as the really powerful
chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to apply more of it and at a
greater rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's easy to get locked into
the situation where you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I refuse to apply this really,
this chemical that I feel may be harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go one step down,
but I have to apply it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the, the, the fault will be a
lack of consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you just missed one application and
that's enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it'll be like over, over years,
you'll be applying it every two weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: but every six weeks you'll miss a
treatment and it'll just be a perpetual
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say when you're using these
active, uh, active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Approaches that aren't necessarily
incredibly efficient, but still work
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be very consistent wall, always
keeping in mind the lower levels of the
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM pyramid, sealing your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consistent passive approaches to
protecting your plants and making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not an influx of new plants or new
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other advice do you have for maybe
some new gardeners brand new to the game?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else you could tell
them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would really say, um, like I,
you know, I don't want to repeat myself
[SPEAKER_01]: too much, but I would say you need to
approach this as holistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's very easy to be like,
I love, I'm so excited to grow a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm looking at what I can feed
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl, I'm very happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a pest comes in and it's like,
that wasn't even in your, in your
[SPEAKER_01]: worldview that you would get a pest
infestation and you're shocked by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're scrambling to chase it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to look at this as a holistic
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are growing a plant that is,
you know, has the genetic capability to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert sunlight into a beneficial food
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's interested in it, not just
humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one, uh, phrase that I love is
that when you're you're creating a perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for your plants, you're also
creating a perfect environment for their
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just need to be holistic and view
this include IPM and include the pests
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to be coming in in your
mindset from day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll just be so much more prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about passive defense,
consistent passive protection so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not, you just never want to
scramble to protect these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that applies in other ways as
well, um, to things like fertilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to notice that you have a
deficiency and fight to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to just view the entire picture
at once and not have these issues crop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say, you know, just don't be
scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dig into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody, everybody has a lots
of dead plants in their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a great hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dig in.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that interests me is upcoming
technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about that a little bit,
you know, with the intro light,
[SPEAKER_00]: did you want to get deeper into the intro
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other upcoming technologies
that relate to combating pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of new crop protection
technologies coming on, coming onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously I'm a big proponent of intro
light where we use LEDs to just flash a
[SPEAKER_01]: little 60 second burst of pesticidal light
every 24 hours, where this can be properly
[SPEAKER_01]: applied.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a really beneficial,
easy way for you to protect your crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, you know, that's a situation
where we're utilizing the new technology
[SPEAKER_01]: of LEDs to produce a very specific
wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a very new, newly available
thing to humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a lot of other new
technologies that are coming onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're seeing a lot of
agricultural robotics that won't be so
[SPEAKER_01]: applicable in the home garden for many
decades, but, uh, there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible technology, you know,
using machine learning and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, visual AI to detect, um, for example,
weeds in a field, um, and zap it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little laser, just to, just to kill it
before it comes up or even zap it with
[SPEAKER_01]: little shoot of a little spray of
herbicide instead of covering the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: field, cover that little one into,
uh, one in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you mentioned the enzymatic,
um, uh, uh, mammoth enzymatic,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some, there's some really
interesting things coming forward with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, specifically choosing special
enzymes and they are just incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, imagine when we're talking about
something like a, um, a predatory mite or
[SPEAKER_01]: a ladybug, what's it doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's hungry, it goes in there,
it consumes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same with the enzymes,
but on a, on a micro, micro microscopic
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're hungry little, little
molecules that just consume things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the problem with them is shelf
life really, and it's how long they last
[SPEAKER_01]: on the surface of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as there's new developments there,
we're going to see some really impressive,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, enzymatic approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like just the tiniest amount of
enzymes for a whole acre of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that I'm very excited about,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, there, there's a lot on the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like it's going to make things
a lot easier in the future for the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we could sit here and talk on and on
about more and more pests, but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: running out of time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So might have to save that for part two,
potentially wrapping things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would say the best place is just
to go to intro light.co and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can check out, you know, that really
is, uh, the main thing I'm working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is delivering a new cutting edge
pesticidal technology to people at a
[SPEAKER_01]: really affordable level, um, to reduce
their long-term crop protection expenses,
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the stress and reduce having to
seek out pests and constantly apply
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just want to give you another,
and I want to add to the bottom of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, IPM pyramid and just say, here's
another passive treatment that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's the best place to find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have coming up is simply new form
factors, because I say, if you give me a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a spider mite or a therp in a box,
I can, I can kill it anytime with our
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is plants are very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's growing in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do we deliver that light to
the most, uh, the largest surface of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it requires various form factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we have coming up is new form
factors, uh, for vertical farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: for cloning shelves, uh, mobile form
factors and, uh, and things like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon, this has been very insightful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to intro light
down in the YouTube description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also throw up your Instagram in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have an Instagram page,
so I'll put that there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give him a follow on Instagram.

[SPEAKER_00]: Also subscribe to the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already every single
weekend, I'm releasing a new garden talk
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love for you to tune into future
episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simon, once again, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have to do a part two if you're
available sometime in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know there's just, it seems like
you've got so much knowledge that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, uh, expel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know my audience is going to get a
lot of value from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, let's do a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there'll be a new virus coming
onto the scene, you know, that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
