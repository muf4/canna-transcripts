[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel for those of
you that don't know me My name is Chris
[SPEAKER_00]: aka mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking the can of troll this dragon
curing machine has absolutely Exploded in
[SPEAKER_00]: my comment section recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried the can of troll?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it can control worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the can control work?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the can of troll
can of troll?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did end up getting one and I'm
using it right now You can see it right
[SPEAKER_00]: behind me right there and I also stopped
by the can of troll booth at MJ BizCon and
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to the inventor and that
Interaction is what I'm gonna show you in
[SPEAKER_00]: today's video Before we get into that
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been absolutely flooded with people
asking me for a discount code I spoke to
[SPEAKER_00]: the company and they do not do discount
codes However, they gave me a link which
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll post on the YouTube description
section below and also put it as a pinned
[SPEAKER_00]: comment Which will show any sales that
they have currently and also shows
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple unit discounts So make sure you
click that link in order to get the best
[SPEAKER_00]: price possible Alright, let's warp over to
MJ BizCon and talk to the inventor David
[SPEAKER_02]: Sandelman about the can of troll Yes,
this is our home unit This takes about two
[SPEAKER_02]: point one two point two pounds of wet
flour You put your wet flour in Close the
[SPEAKER_02]: door Unfortunately, we can't have flour
here at the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it'd be full of nice flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah And then you close it and basically
hit the start button Bring us a rundown.
[SPEAKER_02]: The display is showing us a very low dew
point because it is so dry here in Las
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegas But you'll see that it'll come back
up to set point once I close the door You
[SPEAKER_02]: put the flour in about eight days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have amazing Smokable flour eight days
eight days and what would you set this to
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're recommended setting?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all preset So if you touch this it's
already set at 68 degrees and a 54 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: dew point this one was set for a five day
dry cycle and then Someone's playing with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They left it for a 20 day cure cycle,
but you can leave the flour in here For
[SPEAKER_02]: months we've had flour in the box for as
much as two years and people are blown
[SPEAKER_02]: away And how sticky and supple the flour
comes out two years later and the longer
[SPEAKER_02]: you leave flour in here the more it cures
So what we like to do is do a harvest take
[SPEAKER_02]: down put it in Try and cure and just leave
it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even take it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just pull buds out But then if we're
doing perpetual harvest, we'll take all
[SPEAKER_02]: the flour out 12-16 weeks later when the
next harvest is ready and we'll put it in
[SPEAKER_02]: a sea ball or a sealed bag of vessel We'll
try the next batch Then when that's done
[SPEAKER_02]: about eight days We take it and put it in
brown paper sandwich bags and right on the
[SPEAKER_02]: brown paper sandwich bag the date of
harvest and the cultivar and then we take
[SPEAKER_02]: the other that we took out earlier and
then over time you start accumulating nice
[SPEAKER_02]: brown paper sandwich bags with the
cultivar and the date of harvest So before
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it you might have ten different
cultivars in there What do we feel like
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Break off a little piece of the bud put
the bag back in at that point You want to
[SPEAKER_02]: think about ice cream that you'll never
leave ice cream out on the counter Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially here in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would never want to leave that bag
outside because it's gonna dry You know
[SPEAKER_02]: take off what you need put the bag right
back in there close the door and then
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy that flour Yeah, I even like to take
just small pieces in a small grinder So I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have too much ground flour laying
around because you'll see over a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: days how the texture of that ground flour
changes Yeah, it's becoming real well
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of my audience is familiar
with your brand and this product really
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge help, especially in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently use a wine fridge,
but there's some downsides To a wine
[SPEAKER_02]: fridge compared to this right no
comparison because what a refrigerator
[SPEAKER_02]: does is it's cooling Yep, and it's
constantly drawing moisture out of the air
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will eventually over time
perpetually over dry the flour if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: in a sealed jar You're basically just
holding it in a cold space Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not actively maintaining the water
activity and the moisture of the flour So
[SPEAKER_02]: at that point whatever moisture was in the
flour when it went in the jar is what it
[SPEAKER_02]: is Yeah, if it was over dry, it's gonna
stay over dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it had too much moisture You can risk
the chance of mold so you have to burp But
[SPEAKER_02]: if you open the jar and let that moist air
out and then close it that flour is gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: rehydrate the jar and get drier And then
if you burp it again Close it the flour is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna lose more moisture and yeah And over
time that flour is gonna get drier and dry
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually a dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not Actively actively keeping it
hydrating because what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: you're starting with the wet flour And
we're maintaining the target moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, so the flour dries and then lands and
holds it there It comes to equilibrium and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's now in a stable environment with the
perfect curing conditions So you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's why we like brown paper bags
is that paper permeable that way moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: can freely move between the flour and
What's in the box now?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about those grove bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen grove bags and what we
recommend if someone has a grove bag and
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to use it in the box Yeah,
leave it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no don't heat seal it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't yeah You don't want to trap what's
in the bag you want when you're in this
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment the water vapor
pressure to freely move Between the flour
[SPEAKER_02]: and the environment we're creating in the
box as soon as you put something sealed in
[SPEAKER_02]: here You're sort of defeating the purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah great point The recommended
temperature and humidity a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: got the red relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the recommended for drying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we do drying and curing it pretty
much close to each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep So we're holding it around the 68
degree dry bulb temperature 16 Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_02]: and a 54 degree dew point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't talk much about humidity Yeah,
you showed the humidity down here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's a calculated value an interesting
thing about humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made up of two variables So when
people say oh, I want to control humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: you really can a good Equivalent would be
saying I want to control my monthly
[SPEAKER_02]: payment Well, you can't control the
monthly payment itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you can control the interest you can
control the principal You can control the
[SPEAKER_02]: time change any of those and it's going to
change the monthly payment But you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: change the monthly payment directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah humidity is the same thing Humidity
is made up of the temperature and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: made up of the amount of water vapor In
the air the dew point or vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: those two make humidity change either of
those the relative humidity changes But
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't change the relative humidity
because it's made up of these two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: items Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, make sense make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for showing the
product today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it I've been using the Canada
troll for the past several months now for
[SPEAKER_00]: storage and I'm using it right now for
drying for the first time So I really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold off on any feedback I give in
regards to it until I complete at least
[SPEAKER_00]: one Dry cure cycle, but I want to pass off
the question to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the Canada troll?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below
