[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got another PAR test video for you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunrays sent me over their LED grow light
and in this video I will unbox the unit
[SPEAKER_00]: and also measure the PAR output using my
Abogee MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get right into the unboxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out the box is this thank you
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that there's a user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is one light ratchet hanger,
one wire hanging kit, and a five foot
[SPEAKER_00]: power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling out the light I was a little bit
surprised by the size of it because the
[SPEAKER_00]: listing says it's for a three foot by
three foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their core coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: However it was the same size light as some
of the other lights I have PAR tested for
[SPEAKER_00]: a two foot by two foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the grow star light and the
minger light that I did PAR tests on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those lights are the same size as
this one, but it does say on their listing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're using 90 degree lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how those lenses reflect
light onto a three foot by three foot grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about all of the
grow lights features in this video,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will leave a link in the description
section below so you can learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light has two switches on
it, one for veg and one for bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged the LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter and turned on the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: switch and it is pulling 121 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I turned off the veg switch and just
turned on the bloom switch and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 50 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I flipped both the veg and the bloom
switches on and the unit is pulling 164
[SPEAKER_00]: watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hung the light in a four foot by four
foot grow tent, but like I said the core
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage area for this light is three foot
by three foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep my PAR meter within a
three foot by three foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This PAR test is just really to give you a
general idea of what the PAR output is for
[SPEAKER_00]: this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflective walls could increase the
numbers, so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the user manual, the
manufacturer recommends a distance of no
[SPEAKER_00]: closer than 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be the first measurement that I
take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also do measurements at 24
inches and 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below
and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
