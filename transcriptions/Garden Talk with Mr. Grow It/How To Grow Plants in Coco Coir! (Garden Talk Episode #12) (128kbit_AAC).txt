[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually changes the flavor of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the bugs actually go to bite
into the plant, it tastes bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually, they're like,
oh, this is not a plant that I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they leave and they go to search
for some other type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just believe what they give you on
the back of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix what's on the back of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be surprised to realize how
insanely high it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, that's not 1.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that comes out to like 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I set my pH at 5.8, it is not
budging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can come back a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how many times I flood my
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa medium itself, it doesn't hold
on to nutrients like soil does,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good and bad, which is why some
people use play with your nutrients ahead
[SPEAKER_00]: of time before you get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your nutrient system because that's
going to be the most vital thing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Dog Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Doggo the
Hutt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're part of the gardening community
on YouTube, there's a good chance you've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the host of GrowTube, which was a
very popular weekly live stream that has
[SPEAKER_01]: over 100 episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for nine years now
and he enjoys growing a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants from fruit trees, leafy greens,
medicinal plants, blueberries,
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries, peppers, and a whole lot
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many to name.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we talk about growing
plants in Cocoa Coir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doggo has been growing in Cocoa Coir for a
very long time now, and so I figured I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down with him and dig deep and find
out what exactly he does when he grows his
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in Cocoa Coir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick note on a mess-up in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mispronounced the word cat-ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, I pronounce it as caition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to give you a heads up on
that one because I know there are some
[SPEAKER_01]: sticklers out there that won't hesitate to
call me out in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to subscribe to the channel
if you haven't already.

[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Doggo the Hutt.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Garden Talk.
Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to connect with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great to finally meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely very inspired by your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: GrowTube and your YouTube channels and so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm totally pumped to have you on here
this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly climb the ranks and shoot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're way up there over a hundred
thousand subs now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kick a butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those that don't know who you are,
can you just tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and kind of how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just a regular person, just like a
lot of the people watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing because several years
ago, early on in my thirties, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: diagnosed with degenerative disc disease
for my spine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two vertebrae that are nearly
disintegrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we took the MRIs and everything,
my spinal cords pinched and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: overweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the doctors wanted to do was pump
me full of a bunch of Vicodin and over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really against that because
early on I had a friend of mine,
[SPEAKER_00]: a younger brother passed away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had some family addictions and
things like that related around
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription medication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always stayed away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got to the point where I couldn't
sleep more than like three, four hours a
[SPEAKER_00]: night, just from the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was some friends of mine that
had reintroduced me to the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it once when I was back in
college, had freaked out and just never
[SPEAKER_00]: really paid attention to it because it
just wasn't my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After being slowly reintroduced to it and
also being introduced to CBD, it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: life changing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very life changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could sleep at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slept like a baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was becoming a better person
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mood was much more relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my stress was going away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a complete 180 for me,
which is why I really consider it a
[SPEAKER_00]: miracle plant because it really did change
my life and my surroundings and my family
[SPEAKER_00]: life and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, CBD in the early 2000s
was very hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it would come in a dispensary,
you would have to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't get there that day,
there was no way that you were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it because 24 hours later it'd be
gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was in a dispensary one day and they
just had, there are these, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: can of tonic plants over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was checking out and I said,
you know, and I was new at the time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you guys just, you sell those?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, oh yeah, no,
it's California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow, you know, you have your
card, you're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get X number of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right, I'll take one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I got home and my wife was
like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Hey, look, if I can't find it
anywhere, I might as well grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, it just went to going to
cups, uh, learning from learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I discovered Vader and ocean
grown seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just from going to cups,
uh, you know, being a fan of ocean grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: learning, interacting with the crew,
slowly becoming a part of the crew,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, kind of being adopted under Vader's,
uh, wing, if you will, and learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning about the industry as a whole,
because also at the time I kind of came
[SPEAKER_00]: into the industry relatively hot because I
was so hot on this idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I immediately tried some friends and I
started up a company, uh, called Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Cruz bakeware, which was a tremendous,
uh, beautiful failure, uh, or beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: disaster, I think is a great term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we came in hot and that's also
part of not only learning to grow and hang
[SPEAKER_00]: around ocean grown, uh, it was great for
Vader to also teach me about the community
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, Hey, you know, a lot of that
stuff doesn't work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those, those kinds of marketing
practices and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me teach you about the plant,
the community, what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took several years to beat that out
of me, but I've kind of learned and
[SPEAKER_00]: adopted and grown over, over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, started up shows like
the grow tubing, bringing other people
[SPEAKER_00]: together, starting to use some of my
networking skills, uh, that the community
[SPEAKER_00]: could benefit from and, um, you know,
start doing shows and growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of where I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this, this has been kind of like a
hobby way, a medical necessity turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme hobby turned into potentially I
could do this for a living someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the ultimate goal is
to, you know, be able to become
[SPEAKER_00]: financially independent and do this for
myself and my family, uh, without having
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about anybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember watching you on grow tube,
um, you know, be the host on there and you
[SPEAKER_01]: really did a great job, um, as far as
bringing together a group of guys who,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and girls who, um, who really just had
all different knowledge bases across the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you had somebody who knew
lighting, you had somebody who knew
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and they could really just chime
in about the different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you know, each show was a
different topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you had like, geez, I remember it
was like 500 to 800 people when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: tuning in were tuned in as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was live stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was very, very popular and you had
over a hundred episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so hats off to you on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, you know, that channel was
erased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, YouTube is just,
yeah, it's who knows, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, it changes, uh, all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, that channel went down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had actually tried to upload it on
other platforms at the time were removed
[SPEAKER_00]: from other platforms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, now luckily it lives on its own
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the episodes are re-uploaded
and actually what, what encouraged me to
[SPEAKER_00]: re-upload it was I was going through my
backup hard drive one day and my backup
[SPEAKER_00]: drive crashed, literally crashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to, uh, the disc wouldn't mount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to recover all like four
terabytes of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to try and recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't even get all the shows back
off of that drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I was like, okay,
I'm just going to re-upload this again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at least it's out there because my,
my backup drive is crashing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe there's like 80 some odd
shows re-uploaded to the channel now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it lives in its own place,
which I think is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should have always lived in its own
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like this new, the way
people have everything segmented now,
[SPEAKER_00]: even like yourself, you have, you know,
one channel for the show, one channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, for the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so that's kind of what we're
doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my channel grow tube has its
channel over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our new project grows workshop
has its own channel as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link all three of those channels down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So viewers can head on over and check out
the different shows you got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the topic for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing in cocoa coir, you have a lot
of experience doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've grown for several years in cocoa
coir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really want to pick your brain about
it, how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I know you have a full seed to harvest
video growing in cocoa and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so we're kind of referencing that
in a sense, but let's break down
[SPEAKER_01]: everything there is to know about kind of
growing in cocoa, at least your experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: When growing in cocoa, cause there's so
many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, let's start with the medium itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular brand that you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get cocoa in bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get cocoa in bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, talk about your experience kind of
growing in either different brands or
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks versus bags, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I honestly don't have any
experience using the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never had to rehydrate and use
the, uh, the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've tried, uh, I think it's a mother
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cocoa brand and other brands before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've really just ended on Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and Kana is what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people, you know,
they see the Instagram photos and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, well, what's, what's the recipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's everything you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always tell people, well,
my regime is actually very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, kind of like the kiss method,
keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is, it's Kana and mammoth and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've, there's a formula that they have
that works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the cocoa coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cocoa coir itself is, oh, I don't know
where exactly they source it from,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like the loam of the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just so fluffy every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get consistent results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, as someone who's breeding,
I need consistency more than anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to know that when I'm doing run
after run after run, I'm going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: same results because I'm pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to search out strains and I
can't have all this swing or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I buy four bags and three of them are
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then one bag's crappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got like half of my plants are doing
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then a couple of plants, I can't figure
out why, what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's like, you know,
spring tails floating around in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I don't get, because you had to
win a one bag, one bad batch of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I've.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tend to stick with Kana, um, because it
works for me and I get consistent results
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with Kana, you don't have to do any of
the, the rinsing or the buffering before
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you do need to do with the bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana is already precharged as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of cocoa you'll get when you,
um, um, kind of rehydrate it, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and for the viewers that don't know
what we're talking about is what they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: do is they'll dehydrate cocoa and then
vacuum pack it down into these bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you get a bag of cocoa,
it's this big fluffy bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so shipping and stuff becomes a pain
and it's more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people who are looking to,
you know, people looking for a more
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable option will tend to go for the
bricks because they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Kana sells the bricks and they're
half the price they are of their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another great way to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically you have to rehydrate them
and recharge them as they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically what they're talking about
is the, uh, the magnesium in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, uh, cocoa has a, and I hope I
don't screw this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a, and I'm going to pronounce it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is it cash and ion exchange?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where Cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where, see, this is why I did
the grow tube because at first I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to have all the experts on to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just, it's just me absorbing the
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be wrong with the way you
pronounce it anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what will happen, what that
basically means is that the cocoa medium
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, it doesn't hold on to nutrients
like soil does, which is good and bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why some people use it,
which is why I love growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, because it doesn't hold anything
and is truly an inert medium, but in order
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to function properly for that
exchange to happen properly, you need a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of magnesium in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically when you're running in
cocoa, a lot of people, they'll say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you got to throw an extra cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, why, why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's because the cocoa will eat it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the cocoa will actually absorb the
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it just sits there and holds
there and it's not available for the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the rest of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hold a whole lot of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those all get uptaken and then
there's nothing left for the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see a lot of magnesium
deficiencies, uh, when you start to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: with cocoa and then you throw LEDs into
the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grow cocoa under LED LEDs,
as we know, sucks the magnesium right out
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants, or at least makes them churn
through it a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they starve for it because of all the,
uh, uh, the blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, typically you'll need to add some
extra cow mag or recharge that brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cow mag solution to load up that
cocoa with some, some extra magnesium and
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and get it ready for its first
run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you can soak up the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another good thing to look for our
cocoa, whatever the brand is, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure the wicking properties are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you can judge kind of a
good batch of cocoa versus bad batch of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to water at the bottom
of your pot and the water should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to wick upwards all the way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how cocoa is doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, w the way I grow is actually,
uh, how can it recommends not to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, which is oddly enough,
faders come up with this, this very
[SPEAKER_00]: awkward formula and style of growing,
but it works fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that wicking is another way you can
judge, you know, regardless of the brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it going to wick, uh, and is it going
to distribute that water evenly throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: your pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also partly what you're looking
for as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get soggy spots versus like
dry spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in soil now, but when I did grow in
cocoa, um, I grew probably about maybe six
[SPEAKER_01]: or seven plants, just total in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have some experience, but I'm not an
expert by any means, but I did get those
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap bricks off of Amazon and boy,
are they loaded with sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and boy, is it a labor intensive
process to rehydrate the bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the, the rinsing process,
the buffering process, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're adding in that calcium
magnesium, it's very labor intensive and
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's actually a really good video
if anybody's interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learning more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's by Dr. MJ cocoa, uh, search how to
rinse and buffer cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe if you search that, then you'll
get to the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be one of the first ones that
pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's step-by-step on how to do those
processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend watching that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after doing that, I'm just going to go
with the bags for now on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's so much more time saver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even recommend to people buy the cheap
cocoa in bags before you resort to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bricks should really be a last resort.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can afford it, if you can get to a
store, I totally understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are in red States or red,
you know, countries and they need to get
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff shipped discreetly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bricks is really your only option.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great option for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the ability, even if it's
cheap cocoa, go with the cheap cocoa in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag before you go with the brick,
you will just save yourself headaches down
[SPEAKER_00]: the road in terms of trying to figure out
why your pH is off and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why, why isn't it reservoir stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of things that people do with
cocoa is, you know, have the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, but they'll add an additional
aeration, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So perlite is a common thing that people
add in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you add any type of aeration into it,
whether it be perlite or rice holes or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nothing pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's why I said, that's why I
love the can of cocoa because it's so airy
[SPEAKER_00]: and fluffy itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need, you don't need to add
anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality is so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's buffered already so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, the whole system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't add anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a good thing I will recommend to add
for people who do like to add is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 70 30 is a really common mix,
70% cocoa core and 30% perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I've even seen Fox Farms has a
70 30 mix they're selling now too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's becoming very popular with a lot
of the kind of soil or media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And companies are putting together that 70
30 mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works great for a lot of the top
down feed, drain to waste type of feed
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, where a lot of people,
where most people grow in cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: they do drip system and it's top down.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do with the flood and drain,
because we want all of that wicking action
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're flooding multiple times a day,
we don't need any perlite in there because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're constantly bringing fresh oxygen to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should, if you don't mind,
I'd like to dive into that because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people ask, well, why do you add
perlite?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole point of adding perlite is to
have aeration in your soil or your medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To bring oxygen to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for something like soil, where
everything's very tight and compact and it
[SPEAKER_00]: holds onto a lot of moisture, you need
that perlite in there to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: room for air and for oxygen to get into
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa, because it's an inert medium,
because it doesn't hold on to very many
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and because it has a finite
amount of hydration that it can hold as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes almost impossible to overwater
in cocoa because it's only going to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: onto a finite amount of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you have a pot that drains
correctly, you're never going to overwater
[SPEAKER_00]: it because it's going to hold onto
whatever it wants and the rest of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just going to wash right out the bottom of
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why it's a hydroponic or
considered a hydroponic medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we do with flood and drain,
because we have the waterfall effect in
[SPEAKER_00]: our reservoirs, we flood multiple times a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four times a day, we're bringing fresh
aerated oxygen water to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no need for perlite in a flood
and drain type setup because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly bringing oxygen to the root
zone four times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perlite, in our instance, not
necessarily needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're going to do like a top
down drain to waste, you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbles running in your reservoir or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to water it once a day
or maybe twice a day and it's just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want that perlite in there to
add a little bit more aeration in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that's how the roots are getting
their oxygen is from the aeration in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium as opposed to bringing you
delivering oxygenated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should think about keeping some
perlite in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's going to depend on how you
decide to grow in cocoa, what your feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: method is, whether or not you decide
perlite is right for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great info on that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you usually do from seed,
at least the stuff that I've seen from
[SPEAKER_01]: seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size and type of grow pots do you
usually start in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it all starts with the 32 ounce
paper waxy cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is by far my favorite starting
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask, what are those paper
cups?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waxy cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get them at Smart and Final here in the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can order them online somewhere
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any 32 ounce waxy cup, they come
smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even go bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the 32 ounce because I can get four
to six weeks from seed in that cup before
[SPEAKER_00]: having to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I do transplant,
it's great because you just rip down to
[SPEAKER_00]: the seam of the cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cups are already a little wet and
soggy already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just rips off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole cup rips off and you're left
with this beautiful root zone that you get
[SPEAKER_00]: zero transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just go drop that into
the larger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the larger pots, there's two
different methods depending on what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: stock at the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what you'll see, like what I use
in my seed to harvest video, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: eight inch cocoa pots or cocoa tech
baskets or cocoa tech pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically cocoa that is they use to
glue some kind of adhesive medium and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hard pressed into the shape of a pot and
it will hold its it'll hold its shape
[SPEAKER_00]: there for 10 to 12 weeks in flower run.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically I'll do the seed and veg in
the paper cup and then transplant to the
[SPEAKER_00]: eight inch cocoa tech pots and flower in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, recently over the course of last
year, those have been increasing in price
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's like three dollars per cocoa tech
basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can get quite expensive,
especially when you use it once and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've also used and I've dug out and I'm
doing it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the eight inch net pots and those
are plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically what I'll do with the eight
inch net pots is I'll put a layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen at the bottom of the pot for
about an inch or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what covers up all the holes in
the net pots, because a net pot isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: typical pot, you know, where it has just a
couple of drain holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the entire bottom, you know,
one inch of the pot is all mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get lots of good water up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem is cocoa can fall out and
into your tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do the eight inch net pots,
line the bottom with a layer of hydrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: then put the cocoa in on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the cocoa when it gets wet,
it kind of solidifies into a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a root mass and the roots will gain and
help solidify all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it prevents the cocoa from draining
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eight inch cocoa tech baskets or eight
inch net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to be the best size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason I go with the eight inch
size pots is because when we're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, flood and drain with cocoa,
because it's hydroponic, the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: will the roots will just grow out of the
pot and right into the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants don't really get root
bound all that much in flood and drain
[SPEAKER_00]: with cocoa because it's hydroponic,
because you're flooding four times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when the root zone grows out into the
tray, it's still getting water four times
[SPEAKER_00]: a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still staying plenty wet,
plenty hydrated, and it's getting plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just going to sit there in the
tray and be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's flip over to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cocoa is an inert medium, doesn't have
any nutrients in it to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to start feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of nutrients do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: When does your first feeding happen and
what does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the formula Canna, the full Canna
Coco formula, which is Canna Coco A and B
[SPEAKER_00]: as the base nutrients, Cannazyme for our
enzymes, Rhizotonic for the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later in the flower, we'll add in
the PK13 and then we'll add some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: boost as well when we get in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the only supplement I add is
Mammoth P for my microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will use that recipe starting from
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the trick is you can't just dump
in full nutrients right away from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Canna runs off of the
electroconductivity system as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go off of EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the viewers that don't know the
conversion chart, typically 1.0 EC is 500
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you ever see someone refer to,
oh, well, I'm 1200 parts per million,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can usually divide that by 500 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give you a rough idea of the EC
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most commonly used EC scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a couple of them out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the seedling stage, right from seed,
I feed at 1 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that'd be Coco A, Coco B,
my Cannazyme, my Rhizotonic and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth P. And I'll put it in very light
dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the whole recipe laid out in my
seed to harvest video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that starts from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even from seed, I'm watering four
times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the tray gets flooded four times a day,
three times with the lights on and once in
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle of the dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, because it's cocoa,
you can't really overwater it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have never had any issues with
flooding so much, keeping it moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, with flood and drain,
that water is always oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the root zone is always getting
oxygenated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It thinks it's in a DWC system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moves over all the way through veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll keep 1.0 EC all the way through
veg when I get ready to flip the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I'll bump it up to a 1.3
EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just basically add a little more
Coco A and B, a little more Cannazyme,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more Rhizotonic, boosts
everything up a little bit to 1.3 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth, I keep the same kind of all
throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of feeding doesn't change
because it's just microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just inoculating the cocoa with
microbes every week when we do a new
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll add in the boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the boost is our carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the boost is all of our sweeteners,
the carbohydrates to feed the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mammoth pea helps everything boogie
inside the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during weeks three to five is
when we add in the PK13-14.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to add a little more
potassium, a little more phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_00]: help the plant get into that budding
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a trick with Canna,
when you add in the PK13, it can really
[SPEAKER_00]: not only up your EC, but really up your pH
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to keep an eye on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically what I like to tell people,
the two to three weeks that I'm adding in
[SPEAKER_00]: the PK13-14, which is usually like weeks
three to five of flower, typically it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be weeks four or five of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'd have a shorter flowering strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to be an eight week
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'll usually do weeks four,
weeks five.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's going to be a longer strain,
I know this is going to be a 10 week
[SPEAKER_00]: strain, or like if I'm growing the Maui
Waui, okay, this is going to be a 12 week
[SPEAKER_00]: strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do it for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll do weeks three, four, five,
just to get that budding cycle going more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you add that PK13, you got to
pull back on the A and B because what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is you'll shoot way over your 1.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get like 1.6, 1.7 EC, and then your
pH be upwards around like 6.5,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I should also note, we haven't
really touched on pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing in cocoa, you really want to
keep your nutrients around 5.8 pH because
[SPEAKER_00]: the way cocoa interacts with the root
zone, we talked about that because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that all functions, you want to keep
your pH around 5.8 as opposed to 6.5 is
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're shooting for in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way you have different set of
nutrients available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to keep that around 5.8,
I usually pull back my flowering newts,
[SPEAKER_00]: my AB back to my veg formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm only adding 1.0 EC of my normal
Kana formula like I would for veg by
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in the PK13, and that's going to
bump it up to 1.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always warn people about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just dump it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're adjusting your A and B
because you always got to keep an eye on
[SPEAKER_00]: how many EC or parts per million you're
feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the formula all the way
through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get to the flush stage,
which is really a term, I call it flush
[SPEAKER_00]: because a lot of people refer to it as
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't believe in flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a giant waste of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't flush in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cut off the nutrients to the plant
because, again, the cocoa doesn't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just by simply stopping providing the A
and B to the plant, it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately start to turn on itself and
start to pull food from all of its fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very easy to kick the plant into
that self-consumption mode and to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: and use up all the nutrients in the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you get those beautiful
fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the plant eating itself during
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we'll do is to keep things going
in the rhizos sphere, cut the A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: But during the, quote unquote,
flush stage, we're running our enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running canizine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running the boost for the sweeteners
and I'm still running mammoth P for my
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this way, the enzymes are breaking down
all that leftover dead root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweeteners are in there for all the
microbes to get down and get busy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're still continually inoculating
with microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never have enough microbes,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like we run a bunch of water
through the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the plant could easily turn on
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one week to two weeks,
your plant's fully flushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole feeding formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's five bottles, six if you include the
PK1314.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only extra additives I would add in
would be my weekly IPM, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really nutrient-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the whole flushing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much debate still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much debate about flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny because, well, it's
frustrating because some people call
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing as in running a large amount of
water through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people consider flushing just
cutting off nutrients at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that adds in confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got people talking about two
different types of flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, whether or not you believe in
flushing, leave that up to the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there has been a study out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Artscreen Technologies did a study on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did kind of like a recap type
video on this channel right here,
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Talk with Mr. Gro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about the study that they did and
kind of my thoughts, my opinions on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely it's good to see that
there's actually now studies coming out on
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing and in a sense debunking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know that the nutrients in the
plant aren't, say, leached out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it's not the nutrients,
a buildup of nutrients within the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's causing the bad flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a myth that has been
busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, we're not talking about
flushing in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about cocoa, but a little
side note.
[SPEAKER_01]: But getting back into the cocoa side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I grew in cocoa, you mentioned pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would always do is 5.8 pH going
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do my nutrient solution, add in the
different nutrients, mix them up in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, and then pH it to 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just check the pH going in,
going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, from my understanding,
that cation exchange, going in isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always going to be what's coming out over
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see that runoff go way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might be putting in 5.8,
but your runoff might be 6 point whatever.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always ignored that runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's going to be people who are
commenting on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to say, I checked the
runoff, and this works for me.
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your rhizosphere doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizosphere is going to auto adjust
the pH for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's doing exactly what it's supposed
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, though, but because of that,
that's why a lot of people say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you shouldn't do flood and drain
because your reservoir is just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: drift up to like 6.2 or 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, part of the reason why I love using
Kana is because it's rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I set my pH at 5.8, it is not
budging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can come back a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter how many times I flood my
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the system itself is extremely stable
even when adding in the mammoth P. Now,
[SPEAKER_00]: some microbes are incompatible with the
system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the plus C, which some people
have added in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a very cheap alternative to
mammoth microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it in the greenhouse right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't use it in cocoa because the microbes
are so powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plus C will adjust the root zone and
the reservoir to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to make sure the inputs you're
putting into your system are fully
[SPEAKER_00]: compatible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason I also like mammoth P
with the Kana is because the root zone and
[SPEAKER_00]: the rhizosphere does not adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can add in the mammoth P,
get all the benefits from it, and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't adjust my rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my pH is staying 5.8 consistently.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, if you're doing drain to waste,
and if you're seeing your runoff come off
[SPEAKER_00]: a little different pH, don't worry about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your root zone doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to clarify, you're doing 5.8 pH
for the entire life of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only time I don't really pay attention
to it is again, during that quote unquote
[SPEAKER_00]: flush week, but we're not adding in A and
B and the plant's consuming itself anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really worried about the root
zone at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just making sure there's no nutrients
in there so the plant can do its thing on
[SPEAKER_00]: its own.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what type of water do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always get to water at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I get asked this question,
I realize, you know, it's probably the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing we probably should
have talked about at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: is starting with a clean slate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, I use reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend it no matter where
you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have really clean city water,
if you're going to grow with cocoa and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're starting with an inert media with
nothing in it, you should also start with
[SPEAKER_00]: water, H2O, that has nothing in it,
which is why I love reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I'm saying watering at an EC
of 1.0 or 1.3, all of that is pure
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a discussion with a friend of mine,
he's running Emerald Harvest in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just had to walk through him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's measure your water coming
out of your tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's 0.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we want to add 1.0 of nutrients into
this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to adjust and make sure 1.5 to
1.7 is going to be our target.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to know what your water is
going in versus what's going to be on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even then, even if you're only adding
one EC to that, what's available to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at a 1.7 EC is going to be different
than at like a 1.3 or 1.0 EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just best to start with a fresh,
clean slate if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everyone can't, so I totally
understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's possible, start with reverse
osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see a huge difference in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw such a huge difference just from
switching between tap water to reverse
[SPEAKER_00]: osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I myself will not drink tap water
ever again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always drink either reverse osmosis
water or some type of filtered water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just from seeing the difference in health
and the way the plants react going from
[SPEAKER_00]: tap to RO, it's like, oh, yeah,
what am I putting in my body?
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely only drinking RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried using tap water, my tap water,
for a grow before, and it was just a fail
[SPEAKER_01]: because it actually comes in at like 80
ppm sodium, my local water, which it just
[SPEAKER_01]: builds up and then it just causes all
sorts of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in cocoa, I totally agree with
you on that one, starting with doing RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's going to be arguments saying
that RO can be wasteful because for every
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon, you're going through three gallons
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it's not a waste for me
because I collect my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the reason for me at least as a
grower and why I grow with cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: why I'm able to harvest and collect all
that water is I grow in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very, very strict water rules in
California, especially in residential
[SPEAKER_00]: zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through droughts all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had another winter with literally
little to no rain at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This summer, the water restrictions are
going to be hardcore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can already tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do is I collect all of my reverse
osmosis water from the waste, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: into a giant catch bin on the side of my
shed, out the backside of my shed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will take that and then reuse that water
to water all of the ornamentals in the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants that I don't have to eat,
I have a bunch of veggies and other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in addition to medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use the reverse osmosis water for all
of the ornamentals in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still use it to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it's going right into the
drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you have the space and the
setup, you can use reverse osmosis water
[SPEAKER_00]: and be very responsible with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what also I do is in addition to
collecting the wastewater and using that
[SPEAKER_00]: for the ornamentals, every time I pump up
my reservoir, I take my good
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient-filled water and I will sprinkle
that in all of my veggie gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vegetables get a nice boost of a little
canna once a week here and there and they
[SPEAKER_00]: love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all grown in organic soil,
but they get amended with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir waste every week or two weeks
depending on when I'm dumping the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The veggie garden loves that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get great medicinal plants, I get great
vegetables, and my ornamentals look
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic because they get plenty of water
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My water bill is only about $75,
$80 a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that relates to other
parts of the country, but for California,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a relatively low water bill with a
family of four and running a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic garden in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some really good tips for reusing
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you mentioned that because I
think a lot of people are doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: all-row water.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, mine's just connected to the
drain, the output.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am wasting the all-row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you mention that, I might
actually switch over to putting that into
[SPEAKER_01]: a bucket or something like that and
reusing it in some way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad you mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I know the answer to the next
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still going to ask it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When growing in cocoa, do you use any
cover crops or mulch layers at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, like I mentioned, that wicking
that happens, I like it because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: wick all the way up, and then the top
surface stays just below damp,
[SPEAKER_00]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The surface layer is just dry,
and it actually is great because it keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungus gnats and things away on its
own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I don't want any cover crops
because part of the reason I grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa is because I know it's inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's a lot easier to know what's
going into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the plant's getting only what I
give it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about pH drift or
this drifting or cover crop doing this or
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and even pest infestations and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just to elaborate a little more on
why I love it so much is because if there
[SPEAKER_00]: is a problem, if I start to see a
magnesium deficiency or nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, or worst case, even a
toxicity, I can adjust my formula very
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly and then reset the plant very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in soil or a different medium,
you're going to get a couple of days
[SPEAKER_00]: before you actually start to notice
something's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that I can address that
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flip side of that is that problems
are going to happen immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a pump goes out, you only got 24 hours
before that root zone is dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better get in there quick and fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's shift gears into temperature now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature do you typically aim for
in your grow room?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do maybe lights on temperature and
lights off temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow room will range from the low 70s
up to the low 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep anywhere from like a 10 to
12 degree swing if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I start to hit 15 degree swing,
I'm a little hesitant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worry because I've had so many bad
experiences, but I'm not even going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: the P word.
[SPEAKER_00]: For temperatures, because I run LED,
I actually like to run my room a little
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run LED in veg and in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs don't give off the IR heat that an
HPS or CMH light would.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, the leaf temperature is
typically lower because they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting blasted with IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to keep my rooms slightly higher in
temperature so that way the leaf is warmer
[SPEAKER_00]: from the ambient temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is the room because they're
not getting baked by the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature controller, the exhaust
controller, I have in my room is set to 78
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what will happen is my flower
room and my veg room, the flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: vents and it just recirculates inside the
shed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the entire shed itself gets
above 78 degrees, the exhaust fan kicks in
[SPEAKER_00]: and it exhausts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what I get is by the time it heats
up, the room gets to about 80,
[SPEAKER_00]: 81 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exhaust fan will kick in and then
usually it'll drop down to about 75
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and then it'll kick off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually going to stay within that 75
to 82 range.
[SPEAKER_00]: On some cold nights, it'll really dip
down, like 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: On really hot days, it may dip up into the
high 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, because where I'm at in the
summer to get triple digits, that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually just even turn my exhaust
fan off because when it gets really hot
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day, which is my lights off
period, if it's 100 degrees outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: 103, 104 degrees, it's going to be 90
degrees in my shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually turn off my exhaust fan during
that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower room is still recirculating,
but that way the shed only heats up to
[SPEAKER_00]: like 90 degrees because if I even try and
exhaust it, then I'm just going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking in 103 degree air from the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before you know it, your inside of
your shed is just as hot as it is outside
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're just pulling in hotter air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Monitor your temperatures, keep an eye on
them, use automation where you can to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not anything fancy or expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a simple temperature
controller on an exhaust fan and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how I monitor my temperature and keep it
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do real simple things,
$40, $50 automated switches that can
[SPEAKER_00]: really help make your life easier when it
comes to regulating your temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain humidity that you'll
aim for throughout the different stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you chase after VPD or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I did chase after VPD and now
luckily the way I have my room dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it settles into that VPD window roughly
just by having everything dialed in so I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to necessarily chase for it
like some people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dehumidifiers, if you're growing in an
enclosed environment and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilating, you have to have a good
dehumidification system if you're in an
[SPEAKER_00]: area where you can build up humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in a closed space, even if
you're outside, your climate's really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put 10 plants in a 4x4 tent,
they're going to build up humidity real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick inside that tent so you better have
some way to get that humidity out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Partly why I had so many problems with
powdery mildew in the beginning was
[SPEAKER_00]: because I had crappy humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't working well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't even pumping it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a wonderful episode of GrowTube
where subcold just totally tore me apart
[SPEAKER_00]: because I wasn't training my humidifier,
piping it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know if you have
like a 70 gallon dehumidifier from Home
[SPEAKER_00]: Depot or Lowe's or whatever your big box
store is, a lot of times you can just hook
[SPEAKER_00]: a hose up to it and just pump it out so
you don't have to worry about your bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: because when your bucket fills,
the dehumidifier stops working and then
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when humidity builds up and you get
powdery mildew and all kinds of other bad
[SPEAKER_00]: things, bud rot, all kinds of stuff can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I upgraded to a giant quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I invested, I got a nice discount on
it, which was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the folks at Quest,
but I invested in a Quest Dual 105.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I use now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems big and overly obnoxious,
but actually because it's so efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use less electricity with that big quest
than I was using with my 70 pint that I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought off the shelf from the big box
store because not only does it run less,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it does run, it's more efficient in
the power that it draws.
[SPEAKER_00]: It draws lots of power, but because it's
so efficient that, you know, extracts the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity from the air doesn't need to be
on for long periods of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has very short runtime and very
short cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the way I control everything is
by the flower room cycling through and the
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier in the veg room keeps
everything stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I shoot for 50% relative humidity in
the seedling, cloning and veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just by aiming for that in that
system, because I cycle, the flower room's
[SPEAKER_00]: always naturally going to be a little
higher because there's more plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the flower room's right around 60%
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I like to run things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be 60 to 65 in the grow flower
area and 50, even sometimes down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: 40s, if I can, in the veg area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that's because in my area,
being in the San Francisco Bay,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I'm inland on the East Bay,
you know, if it's a really foggy day in
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco, later that afternoon,
all that's going to push inward East and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get all that humidity is
going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be, you know, 20% outside one
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could be 45, 50% outside the next
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those huge swings, that's what leads
to powdery mildew and everything else in
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always like to make sure I keep my
ventilation and everything going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got 50% in veg and 60 to 65 in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now CO2, do you do any supplementation for
CO2 at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't because I don't have a sealed
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've thrown some of the Teen Bee Naturals
things in the bottom of the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: before, but again, I'm always constantly
not only cycling with the veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg room, but I'm always cycling and
pulling in air from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always getting fresh air and it's
getting fresh carbon from that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's hard for me to tell if it makes a
difference because I'm always exchanging
[SPEAKER_00]: the air, perhaps in a sealed room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I ever get to that stage, I would
certainly give it a shot, but I just,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have a whole lot of
experience with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's flip backwards for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already talked about your whole
feeding routine, but you have a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: questions in regards to, you already
mentioned what you use for microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you incorporate any sugars into your
garden at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people will use molasses as a
soil drench, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use honey, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use any of that when you're growing
a cocoa or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the can of boost comes
into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a proprietary blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, they don't even tell us what's
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, but I know it's, it's fermented
kelp as well as some molasses and some
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is definitely included in the
boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend people to use
sugars of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to feed your
rhizosphere and all the microbes in your
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to make sure to,
to feed your plant those carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of people use just even
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use just plain molasses and that
works great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father-in-law uses molasses in his
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also grows in cocoa, but be careful
because when you start to use all those
[SPEAKER_00]: sweet sugars, it's definitely going to
attract the bugs, fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even ants are really attracted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful if you're pouring just
dumping straight molasses into your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, you know, I like to advise
people to pre-mix it, dilute it a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit instead of just don't jump syrup on
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sugars of some kind are always great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that other brands I've used as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the Remos nature's candy,
which is a great sugar booster before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the advanced nutrients have some
great sugar boosters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud candy is a go-to for a lot of
people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever your preference is,
each one is going to have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly different flavor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been, I've seen some sweeteners
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like blueberry flavored or
strawberry flavored or citrus flavored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I've tried those in the past and it
kind of changes the flavor of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's debatable, but just sugars in
general, just carbohydrates to feed your
[SPEAKER_00]: your microbial and your rhizosphere zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor is subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know that you're doing a flood
and drain system, but I still want to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any type of teas at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it be an aerated compost tea or
nutrient tea, manure tea, anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no teas in the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do use the microbial teas from
Extreme Gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a little tea pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like once a month, I'll do up a tea and
then just feed that to my vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't do that in the greenhouse this
year only because I just ran out of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't, they didn't have any in stock
at my grill store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the soil, I certainly do,
but not for cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, again, just going back to what I
mentioned in the beginning, I really keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it simple because it's, it's not only the
way I grow, just with ocean grown and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: team, we all follow the same SOP,
if you will, because again, when we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and hunting, we're looking for
consistent results every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all follow the same formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all follow the same methodology when
we're doing hunting and breeding because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's, that's what we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just becomes almost a mode of
operation just to get the work done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to do the teas and everything in the
veggie garden and the greenhouse and lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of videos on that stuff are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for the medical garden and what
we do, it's very cut and dry SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you mentioned, you know,
a few minutes ago about pests in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, like fungus gnats are an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have that real wet
medium, they like to thrive on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk a little bit like about IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You briefly touched upon it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you do something, but let's dive
a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do in your garden in order to
prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my IPM consists of two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of a weekly spray as well as
an actual in reservoir oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use SNS 209.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use SNS 209 about 1.1, 1.2 mils per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 20 gallon reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put 30 milliliters of SNS 209 in the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What SNS 209 is it's basically rosemary
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is it's fine for the root
zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will slowly absorb and take up
the rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is it actually changes
the flavor of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the bugs actually go to bite
into the plant that tastes bad and it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, they're like, oh, this is not a
plant that I should be eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they leave and they go to search
for some other type of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a contact killer, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really more of a repellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So throughout the veg stage, I always keep
the SNS 209 in the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I flip the flower, I completely
stop the SNS 209 because it has a half
[SPEAKER_00]: life of about five weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take five weeks roughly
for that rosemary oil taste and flavor to
[SPEAKER_00]: dissipate out of the plant and the root
zone itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to be running SNS 209
through flower because you're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to smoke your buds at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you run it too long, they're going
to smoke and taste like crap because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be very careful of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my in reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great because not only does it
help with the repelling the pests that try
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat the plant, it keeps the reservoir
clean as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about springtails,
fungus gnats, things inside the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they just don't get along with the
rosemary oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for my weekly spray, I use spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Captain Jack's spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just prefer to like that brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Monterey spinosad works good as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Monterey definitely has some spearmint
oil in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely tell there's some mint
or spearmint oil in there as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: pure spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Captain Jack's, that's the contact
killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I use Captain Jack's once a week as
a foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to do it on top, underneath,
get all sides of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's OK if a little bit drips down into
the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't seem to have any effect on the pH
or the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root zones don't seem to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really going to drench them,
I definitely recommend take the plant out
[SPEAKER_00]: of your tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to dump a bunch of spinosad
into your tray because that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: wash, obviously, into your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going real heavy,
pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like spinosad because I can spray
lights on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't got to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes care of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of my, you know,
SNS 209 in the reservoir weekly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a week, every Saturday morning,
I get in there and I spray with the
[SPEAKER_00]: spinosad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, which you can do because bugs will
build up a tolerance to things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've recently started doing is
I've been testing out the mammoth can
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually going to light on this
because it's very heavy in the thyme oil
[SPEAKER_00]: and the spearmint oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the smell can be a little obnoxious for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only complaint is the odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use, if I use it and use the can
control, the odor will last for several
[SPEAKER_00]: days in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it's just not pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the smell of my medicinal plants
as opposed to the smell of spearmint oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just been like once a month
throwing in the can control just as
[SPEAKER_00]: something to something different than the
spinosad, you know, in case new pests were
[SPEAKER_00]: to come into the garden or something,
maybe building up a resistance to the
[SPEAKER_00]: spinosad itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how I approach my IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, no matter what your IPM is,
I highly recommend get into an IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stay on the routine because once you
stop, you get lazy for one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, boom, here come the
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's right when you, right when you
start to relax, they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll catch you slipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pests don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work at 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start to slip.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to cruise right into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really good tips there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of last questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking everything you've learned about
your, about growing in cocoa throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: your experience, what advice do you have
for people who are new to growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already given so much advice in
this episode.
I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I think one of the best tips I
could give is, um, if you're going to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in cocoa, because your nutrient formula is
going to be so important, get a five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon bucket and take an afternoon and
some people will hate it because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to feel like they're wasting
nutrients, but mix up your formulas,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it, get a couple five gallon buckets,
mix up your formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, how do you plan the water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to keep this five gallon
bucket all week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up your formula ahead of time and let
it just sit in your shed or your backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that pH going to drift over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days do you have with whatever
formula you're using where it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be viable for you to feed into
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing drain to waste,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you mix it up at 5.8 pH and you
have a 20 gallon reservoir, that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to slowly deplete over the course of the
week because you're top feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that pH in your reservoir look
like?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the week, what are you
feeding your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So really the biggest tip I can give is
just work on your formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just believe what they give you on
the back of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix what's on the back of the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be surprised to realize how
insanely high it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, that's not 1.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see that comes out to like 2.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does be a lot of times companies
will give high, uh, you know, use lots of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and they want you to really max
out your plants, uh, because you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you're buying more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going through more nutrients that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am of the mindset of, you know,
especially with cocoa feed small because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're feeding every single time we water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 1.0 we see in veg, 1.3 in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix your nutrients up in that five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Play with your nutrients ahead of time
before you get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your nutrient system because that's
going to be the most vital thing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you know what you're feeding
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can the listeners find you and what
do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can find me here on YouTube.
