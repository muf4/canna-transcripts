[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr.Growit
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm back with another Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around I decided to do beginner
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last week I did intermediate questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week I plan to do advanced questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe it might not be next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the week after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still need to gather more advanced
questions for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you actually have any questions that
are more on the advanced side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave them down in the comment section
below and maybe I will include them in
[SPEAKER_00]: that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a majority of my audience is
beginners and I get a lot of beginner
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, so I figured I would dedicate
this video to you beginners out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the video, I just want
to give a quick shout out to our sponsor
[SPEAKER_00]: for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Spider Farmer for sponsoring
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recently sent me their new LED grow
light, the SF-7000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing looks pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm loving the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use seal diodes and an Inventronics
driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls 650 watts from the wall,
has an efficiency of 2.9 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_00]: joule, and covers a five foot by five foot
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: A full disclaimer, I haven't used this
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just me unboxing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently using the SF-2000 and I've
used the SF-5000.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know several people who already
have the SF-7000 up and running in their
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens and they're impressed with it so
far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to the SF-7000 in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to click on that link to learn
more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have a coupon code for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use code MrGrowIt5 for a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that code works on both Amazon and the
Spider Farmer website.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually works for all Spider Farmer
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's get into the
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey Chris, just wondering, is 5.8 pH fine
for soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far it's doing fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant seems to be more compact and leaves
are smaller than my last grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last was on 6.2 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 5.8 pH in soil should be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, general range that you hear on a lot
of websites and forums and everywhere is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to say for soil between 6.0 and 7.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, a lot of these bags of soil
actually come in lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use Fox Farm Ocean Forest
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That usually comes in at like 5.5,
5.4 pH and I usually have to water in at
[SPEAKER_00]: like 6.5 to 6.8 pH and then slowly kind of
drifts up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's able to take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant uptakes nutrients just fine
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some growers out there that say
that the range instead of being 6.0 to 7.0
[SPEAKER_00]: for soil that it's actually 5.0 to 7.0 in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of safe range.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, at different pH levels there's
going to be different nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are charts online that you can
Google search as far as nutrient uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: for plants, pH levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search something like that and you'll see
what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the plant should be fine at 5.8
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may just want to water in at like 6.5,
6.8 pH and then it should drift up over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if you grew a plant on
12-12 light cycle from seed to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done that before actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the solo cup challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, five years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically that challenge was to plant a
seed in a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately have it on 12-12 light cycle
for the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is the plant is going to
spend some time in the vegetative stage no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what light cycle it's on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically for the first 21 days or so,
it'll just veg up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there you'll start to see
pistols or pollen sacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to see signs of sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll start pre-flowering and then
flowering from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can absolutely have it on a
12-12 the entire time if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really recommended because the
extra hours if you'd put on an 18-6
[SPEAKER_00]: instead, you'd have more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would contribute to more energy that
the plant's receiving and therefore more
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in the vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd probably get better results if
you were to veg on an 18-6 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it okay to add a single nutrient like
CalMag if I'm seeing deficiency on a water
[SPEAKER_00]: day or is it best to wait for a feeding
day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, you can absolutely feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of growers, what they'll do is
they'll do CalMag every time even on their
[SPEAKER_00]: watering days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's perfectly fine to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are some growers that just
feed every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time the medium dries out,
they'll feed in, but they'll feed in at a
[SPEAKER_00]: lower dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several different ways you
can go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, short answer is yes,
you can feed CalMag on one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: watering days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I change nutrient companies in flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with advanced nutrients,
but now I am going to feed them rainbow
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, but there's definitely a little
bit of risk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ideally you have the proper
ratio of nutrients throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these companies, they have those
proper ratios on their feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of, you know,
what dosage do you feed the plants now?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going from advanced nutrients,
they have their certain formula switching
[SPEAKER_00]: to a different formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could potentially throw off that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is kind of risky, you know,
changing nutrient companies mid-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you could probably get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these formulas are pretty
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just some small differences there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you could probably get away with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit of a risk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know in the comment section if
anybody out there has done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe somebody out there does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a common practice for them to
change nutrient companies at some point in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comment down below if you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about always watering
cocoa coir with some nutrients or tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read in a lot of different forums
that you should never water cocoa with
[SPEAKER_00]: plain pH adjusted water until it's time to
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, nutrients can definitely
build up in cocoa coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, me growing in particular,
there have been times where nutrients have
[SPEAKER_00]: built up to the point where I did have to
do a watering in order to allow the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat up those nutrients that were built
up in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I had to do a couple
watering days in order to reduce that PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, cocoa coir is an inert medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there are no nutrients in the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers will feed in every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, in my experience, nutrients can
build up and adding a watering day in
[SPEAKER_00]: there once in a while in order to reduce
the nutrients in the medium is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some would argue that even on those days
we don't feed base nutrients, you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be feeding in Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium and magnesium are common
deficiencies when growing in cocoa coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers will swear by feeding
Cal Mag every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as reading things on forums,
just be careful there, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: older threads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I look back at some of the
older threads, I'm talking like from 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago, 15 years ago, sometimes even
like six or seven years ago, there is some
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccurate information in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do further research beyond what you hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm using ocean forest and happy frog
mix, do I still water with nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: plain water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're mixing those two soils
combined, both soils do have nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: them to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't need to add nutrients right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you probably start to need to add
nutrients 20, 30 days of the plant's life,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how often you transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing for 15, 20 days and you
transplant to a larger container,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, then that fresh soil has nutrients
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to start feeding
nutrients right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general guidance is 20 to 30 days,
roughly, is when growers start to feed and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, but you can get a more accurate
picture by using a TDS tester and checking
[SPEAKER_00]: the PPM of the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I talk with you without using
Facebook?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about personal guidance?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come onto my forum, mrgroot.com
slash forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on there almost every day answering
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it might take me two or three
days to get back to you on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people posting on their pretty
big community that we've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Built up over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several active members on the
forum that will go on there and answer
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just me trying to help people
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want one-on-one feedback
from me, really, Patreon is kind of my
[SPEAKER_00]: go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually prioritize Patreon responses as
the first ones that I respond to is
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon messages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll go over to the forum and then
start answering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you try to message me on
Facebook, if you try to DM me on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, if you try to ask questions,
through Twitter, I send everybody over to
[SPEAKER_00]: the forum because, you know, quite
frankly, it's really hard for me to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep up with all these different
platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I send everybody to mrgroot.com slash
forum and ask questions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that allows you to add more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add in pictures, video,
and I can sit down and give more detailed
[SPEAKER_00]: responses for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a new grower and I'm using liquid
nutrients in my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to know if I make a batch of
nutrients and pH the water, how long is it
[SPEAKER_00]: good to sit for?
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably get a different answer from
different people that you ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually asked this question to Rob
from Blue Planet Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he's one of the owners of Blue
Planet Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: His answer was no longer than two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I mix up a batch of nutrients into a
bucket, for example, I should use that
[SPEAKER_00]: within two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are other people out there that
say it's way less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say no longer than 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to lose that because those
nutrients can fall out of solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your best bet probably is just to reach
out to the nutrient manufacturer and ask
[SPEAKER_00]: them what they think because their
particular nutrients, they may have
[SPEAKER_00]: different guidance for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the smell and taste really come down to
the terpenes and flavonoids that are
[SPEAKER_00]: located within the resin glands or
trichomes of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk into your grow room and you
smell the plant, that smell is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes in those resin glands
evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different terpenes will evaporate at
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's mostly going to
come down to genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype, genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think environment is a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying is a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way it's cured is a factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all those different things kind of
combined is going to determine your taste
[SPEAKER_00]: and smell of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you dial in those processes,
it should improve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty dry here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to put a humidifier with
thermostat in your dry room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to add a humidifier in there in
order to increase the humidity in the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: room so the buds don't dry too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a couple tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure the humidifier isn't blowing
directly onto the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you have air circulation
going on so the humidity doesn't reach so
[SPEAKER_00]: high and all of a sudden stagnant air and
mold can potentially happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually put an oscillating fan on the
bottom part of my grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow tent is what I usually use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then air will be able to circulate
down below and it kind of goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually leave like the ventilation
sock up top on the grow tent open so air
[SPEAKER_00]: will be able to exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people actually use an inline fan as
well and put it on a low setting in order
[SPEAKER_00]: for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can absolutely put a humidifier in
your drying room in order to increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you boost RH in a dry environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had two humidifiers going full blast in
the tent and it could only manage 29%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would an external humidifier help?
[SPEAKER_00]: We just talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding a humidifier will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm jumping to an assumption here but I
assume that you have an intake fan
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanging air in your dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with two humidifiers it being at 29%
I'm assuming you're just exhausting too
[SPEAKER_00]: much air out of the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a variable speed controller on
the fan you can reduce it down to like the
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest setting for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people actually don't even use an
intake vent for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just said in the previous question
I'll leave that top ventilation sock open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll actually leave the tent
cracked as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll open up the tent once a day
and completely change the air once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as air is not stagnant you
know adding an oscillating fan down the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also ask would an external
humidifier help?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming what you mean by that is
having a humidifier outside of the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent for example a dry environment so the
air coming in is of the proper humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah you can try that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should definitely help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the Fox Farm 3 bottle system organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick easy answer on this one,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to resolve leggy seedlings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time when the seedling sprouts
from the medium and it's coming up and it
[SPEAKER_00]: appears to be stretchy usually it's
stretching up looking for more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an easy fix is to lower that grow light
so it's closer to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other reason why it could potentially
be a little bit leggy or stretchy as a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling would be because the plant isn't
receiving as much blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've talked about this in a
lot of my recent videos but blue light
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibits cell division leads to a closer
node spacing on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure what light you have
over the plants but keep in mind that the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum could also contribute to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have your lights on 100% power or
use a progressive method?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally do like to conserve energy
where I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Apogee MQ620 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually also have their older model
which is the MQ500 PAR meter and I use
[SPEAKER_00]: that in order to dial in my light
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes I am dimming the fixture
down trying to make it pretty close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plants and then as the plants get
older and larger I am raising the distance
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing the percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am able to dial down the fixture,
use a PAR meter and dial in that distance
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah generally I'm sure there's a lot
of people out there who don't have PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so expensive it's over I think
it's like $575 for the one that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of crazy but just going by
the grow light manufacturer's recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: light distance is generally where I advise
people to start and hopefully the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer has correct light distances
set so you don't you know burn your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or harm your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the lights off temp what do you like
to run the room in veg and flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally it would be 10 degrees lower when
we're talking Fahrenheit 10 degrees lower
[SPEAKER_00]: than the lights on temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm running 82 degrees lights on
temperature you know 72 degrees would be
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal for lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if it creeps below or than that that's
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants still gonna grow high 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even mid 60s when you get into the low 60
degree Fahrenheit you could see a stunting
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also if you're having these large
swings from 82 degrees down to 62 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if you're seeing constant swings
like that that does stress out the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can definitely see issues if the
swings are too large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah 10 degree 15 degree swing
Fahrenheit is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering on taking Oakster Dam
online paced classes it's on sale $9.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend taking this course?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally haven't taken that course
so I can't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakster Dam University is a well-known
university for cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am pretty confident that you're gonna
receive good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not really sure what type of
information that course gives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really tell you if it's gonna
be worth it or not for you unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was able to help you out more on
that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so a few things before in this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing is my beginner grow book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available a paperback form on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a complete beginners guide for
growing both in soil and coca coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor cultivation and it's really just
gonna give you a lot of general
[SPEAKER_00]: information that's gonna get you through
your first few grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really if you're on your first grow
second grow this book is probably more for
[SPEAKER_00]: you versus I've actually had some people
who have like five six years experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They buy and they're disappointed because
well there's beginner information in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah I can't satisfy everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do end up buying it on Amazon
please leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to get 500 reviews on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I have I think 225 reviews so I
have a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody out there that has purchased a
book it would mean a lot to me if you
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a few minutes to leave a rating a
star rating or review on Amazon that helps
[SPEAKER_00]: with ranking, helps more people find the
book so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to all who have left a review
or rating.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing would be the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm continuing to give away items here on
every video until I've run out of items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these items actually got from MJ
BizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never used them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't use any of these products
from GrowTech.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a GrowTech hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two GrowTech hats which you'll get in this
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never used before.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are snapbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some mycorrhizae and beneficial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again never used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of good things about
GrowTech though and their mycorrhizae in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two of these sample packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last thing would be a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a gray t-shirt with black
lettering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't really see it's in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to take it out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know never used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a size large.
[SPEAKER_00]: To enter the giveaway all you have to do
