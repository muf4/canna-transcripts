[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a 2 foot by 4 foot grow tent
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro sent it over to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would get the assembly on
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar like I did with my vlog video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to do this in record
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's actually a record,
but I'm going to do it as quickly as I
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my vlog video I did a 4 by 4 grow tent
assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do it in under 5 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you missed that, I'll link that in the
description section below so you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't quite hit 5 minutes,
but I was very, very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a smaller grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, 2 foot by 4 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still going to aim for 5 minutes
assembly time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can make it this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all of the pieces laid out as
efficiently as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the grow tent unraveled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the bottom part of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a second camera right here
that's going to be recording the stop
[SPEAKER_00]: clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm trying to assemble this as
quickly as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is 5 minutes or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 minutes and 20 seconds on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't have ended on a better note.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to make a quick video of me
assembling this grow tent and sweating
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link to this grow tent in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link to that vlog where I assemble a
4 by 4 foot grow tent as fast as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also linked in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
Peace.
