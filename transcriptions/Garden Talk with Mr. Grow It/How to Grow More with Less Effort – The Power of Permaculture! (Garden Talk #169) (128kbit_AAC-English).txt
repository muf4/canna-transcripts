[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,

Preston Smith.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well, thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be here, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were requested by, I don't know who it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I get requests in the comments
section like, you gotta have Preston Smith
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is so knowledgeable when it comes to
KNF, JDOM, just natural farming in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, and applying it not just on a
small scale, but a medium or a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm eager to kind of dig in to learn
more about you, what you've been doing on
[SPEAKER_00]: your farm resources, recently,
and really some of the techniques that you
[SPEAKER_00]: go through in order to grow your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can we do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super stoked to be here and share with all
your listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are topics I'm super passionate
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: My start in agriculture, really
regenerative, more as a lifestyle really
[SPEAKER_01]: than just an occupation or anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that started back in about
2008, 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had kind of a past life as a draftsman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked a desk job, worked for an
architectural firm, so was really into
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of systems thinking and coming up
with blueprints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for those that remember that year,
there was a collapse of the economy,
[SPEAKER_01]: the construction industry was really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found myself without a good career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time it was kind of,
you know, it was a tragedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, turned out to be a course
correction in my life for me, a window of
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to basically venture into a
completely new field and occupation,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, long story short,
you know, there back then there was this
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling of like, wow, like, the economy
collapsed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just felt really like this is,
you know, these systems in society are not
[SPEAKER_01]: working, they're collapsing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we live like more
regeneratively, more sustainably,
[SPEAKER_01]: more in tune with nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really put me on the path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had the opportunity to move out
to Humboldt County, California in 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: My sister lived out there, her and her
husband, they had a family out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically my brother-in-law offered
me an opportunity to come and work with
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants, get a job on a farm out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I took that opportunity and that
really started a whole kind of chapter of
[SPEAKER_01]: awakening in my life, you might say,
that led me into, you know, wild crafts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wild crafting, spending a lot of time in
the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took some herbalism courses and learned
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, found myself living in the Lost
Coast for a season in Humboldt County and
[SPEAKER_01]: lived in an army tent, so lived off grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kind of forced to like learn how
to be sustainable and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: live off the land and that kind of
setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wild crafting, foraging for mushrooms,
plants, using medicinal trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was all kind of within the
permaculture realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of led me down that rabbit
hole, which led me into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming and just the whole
regenerative farming in general is a
[SPEAKER_01]: large, broad umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many different
methodologies even under regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've never felt married to any one
of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's always been looking for
like the principles behind them all and
[SPEAKER_01]: universal languages because I'm sure
you've noticed a lot of your listeners
[SPEAKER_01]: have noticed like within Korean natural
farming, there's all these acronyms within
[SPEAKER_01]: biodynamics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have all these acronyms within
centropic agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use a lot of terminology and
permaculture has its own terminology,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so and then you get into the
soil food web and microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it could be all really complex,
but if we're distilling it down into
[SPEAKER_01]: principles, it kind of makes it a lot
easier to approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of can, we can see where they
there's overlaps instead of differences,
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of language that is creating
division and in technical kind of groupie,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, areas where we're siloing
information, it becomes way more inclusive
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, went down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me up into Oregon, you know,
consulting for farms in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal settings and hemp fields,
you know, did 10 acres of hemp with Korean
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming and JDOM using some
permaculture techniques, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: along the way I've worked in indoors,
greenhouses, outdoors from, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a five ladder in my garage to,
like I said, 10 acres in in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a vast array of different
settings that I got to practice and learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from all of these different, you know,
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like you've gotten a lot of
experience over the past 15 years doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I could totally relate to what
you mean by confusing with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different acronyms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of my audience kind of
falls on the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this, that, and then they get so
frustrated because they don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just don't do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I noticed that with your
YouTube channel, you make things real easy
[SPEAKER_00]: with the explanations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited for this episode because
we're going to go through a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm sure that my audience is confused
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to explain them in a
beginner friendly manner that people will
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to, to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I love to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe let's start with your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of give us a rundown of what
you've been doing recently on your farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of explained the history of kind
of going up through the Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as fate would have it, it kind of
landed me back in Southern California
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm originally from, specifically
North County, San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in basically a zone 9B, 10A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in a tropical kind of
subtropical.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get some freezes, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to grow a lot of tropical
fruit here, which is extremely exciting to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived in more temperate climates my
whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like three years ago, moving down here,
I've just kind of done a deep dive into
[SPEAKER_01]: more tropical subtropical plants and
fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so currently, you know, I've been
establishing some different food forests,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has really become my passion is
polyculture food for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently, this year, I'm working on a
really exciting project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 22 acres in North County,
San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's primarily its history is an
avocado orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say probably roughly like eight,
eight acres of that is planted with
[SPEAKER_01]: avocados.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few different citrus
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also been used as a flower market
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like Purple Pride, some of these
high value flowers for markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to run with kind of what's
already here, but we're also prepping for
[SPEAKER_01]: centropic agroforestry planting on about
half an acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been sourcing a lot of fruit
trees for that plants that we can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: here, like mangoes, even like,
you know, longan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just picked up some longans yesterday,
papaya, you know, cherimoya.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have several cherimoya trees that are
well established on the property,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a fruit I absolutely love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just really fell in love with,
you know, a lot of these tropical fruits
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just a vast kind of rabbit hole
of fruit that I wasn't even introduced to
[SPEAKER_01]: until a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's my current project.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also implementing more of a
traditional kind of market garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are incorporating, you know,
annuals in with perennial systems and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of experimenting with both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So offering kind of a wide array of,
you know, different polycultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds like you got so much going on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your recent YouTube video, one thing I
noticed that you're doing is you've
[SPEAKER_00]: increased the organic matter in your soil
and you've also added a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of like the first steps
that you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about some sustainable
ways to increase the organic matter in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, what you just
mentioned is probably my favorite way of
[SPEAKER_01]: adding organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of what permaculture and
centropic agroforestry, the methodology
[SPEAKER_01]: there is more looking for things that are
directly in your ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking for materials that we can use
for creating biomass, composting,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a lot of cover crops,
as you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, clover, alfalfa between
those two, you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have, you know, phosphorus,
like alfalfa has an affinity for
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus mobilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between those two, you're really doing
a lot of improvement with the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a no-till farmer, but, you know,
sometimes we have to do a hard reset to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, create a new planting or switch
out a crop or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only time I will ever
recommend really a till because it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: damaging to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's already compacted,
you have erosion going on, you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a system like a monoculture
system you want to swap out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the tilling really makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that first succession,
because really with centropics,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're thinking about the successional
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that clover might just be there
for the beginning to help, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: create that biomass, get the nitrogen
fixation really going in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: get the exudates really pumping down in as
photosynthesis is pumping, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing a lot of those sugars down into
the soil, which is teamed with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, KNF and JDOM when we're putting
IMOs and JDOM microbial solution in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're really building up the life
in the soil along with that biomass and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that nutrient cycling really
pumping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's probably my favorite
way to build up the fertility in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biomass and organic matter is really
growing those cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can get more into, you know,
support plants and, you know, companion
[SPEAKER_01]: planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right off the bat, I'd say get to know
the legume family, nitrogen fixing family,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fabaceae.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say they call Fabaceae because
it's fabulous in the sense that these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them are fast growers,
vigorous growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, they're nitrogen fixers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking that atmospheric nitrogen,
you know, the rhizobia bacteria that is
[SPEAKER_01]: symbiotically growing with a lot of these
legumes is offering us free nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're producing our own fertilizer in
situ.
[SPEAKER_01]: On site, we don't have to go to our
neighbors or a grow store down the street
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, so you could practice
organic farming in a very unsustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into regenerative and even
centropics, now we're looking at directly
[SPEAKER_01]: in our close vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to do things in situ on site
from animals to, you know, plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're growing for those fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be a big cost savings going that
route.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, I can only imagine the amount of
money you're saving from doing it the all
[SPEAKER_00]: natural way versus going out and buying
synthetic nutrients, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a lot of farms are still due to this
day where they're buying chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers and they're adding it onto the
land and they're killing off their
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial population.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just, you know, they're kind
of in a rut to where they're relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: these chemical fertilizers in order to
grow the crops year after year when really
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go the alternative route,
which is the all natural route and use
[SPEAKER_00]: resources from your land.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's free and then grow plants with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that you,
I saw in your video is that you added down
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and I think a lot of viewers are
using compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different types of compost out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know what type of compost do
you recommend and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, along with what I was saying
was I like to do things in situ and really
[SPEAKER_01]: create my own amendments, my own,
my own inputs, my own fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: my own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really depends on the scale and the
timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, the context kind of
drives everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there really isn't a kind of cookie
cutter method that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really all context driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this context, you know,
we didn't have much organic matter in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil here at the farm that I'm currently
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had a lot of decomposed granite,
sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we made the call to source some OMRI
organic certified compost, till that into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, really, it's about a five year
head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about like being able to grow
biomass, chop and drop it, get it all to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really giving ourselves about five
years by tilling in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: good quality compost into the soil from
where we would be if we're just trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: build that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, say with top dressing and again,
you know, using mulches and cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's what we decided to do
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't produce all this compost and make
it myself to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We brought it in from from a local
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cow manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, got a test on that,
because one thing I'd say about compost is
[SPEAKER_01]: we really need to trust the source,
because whatever those animals are eating,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is ultimately going to end up in
your finished compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these herbicides,
you know, different chemicals can make it
[SPEAKER_01]: through the digestive tract of of cows,
of cattle, of livestock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to make sure that doesn't get
into our compost either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly true when they say not all
compost is created equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I did take Elaine Ingram's
course and she has a very specific method,
[SPEAKER_01]: bio complete compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, because,
as you said, not all compost is created
[SPEAKER_01]: equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go to some of the, you know,
landscape supplies around here and what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're selling is compost is essentially
like, you know, wood chips and like sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, where's the organic matter
in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's that's kind of that that
term I would use that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of caution and take it with a
grain of salt, you know, grain of sand,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can viewers look for when they're
going out to purchase compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some compost does come in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are just kind of out the lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something in particular they
should be looking for in the compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, do you recommend testing of the
compost before purchase?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get like a small sample,
test it, make sure everything is good,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then go ahead and do a large purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I mean, I would always
recommend organic, you know, I was at the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow store yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were sourcing some fruit trees for the
orchard and I was looking at a bio dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, that those are
things I would look for, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously organic.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the testing is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually if you're interested in getting
a test result, you can typically,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, email or get a hold of somebody
in the company to get a test result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sometimes the problem with that is
that they are, you know, only required to
[SPEAKER_01]: test so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the batch of compost that
you got might not be the same test result
[SPEAKER_01]: as a previous batch that was made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kind of that can get tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but the company that we use,
I talk directly to they have a Ph.D.,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, agronomist that works for their
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he was able to I was able
to talk to him directly on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he offered a really cool guy offered
me the test results and showed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, negligent really amounts of any
kind of harmful glyphosate or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I would highly recommend,
you know, trying to get a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can talk to the highest quality
control person in that company,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to kind of ensure and get to know
like what, you know, get to know what our
[SPEAKER_01]: our our foods food was eating or like our
plants food, what its food was eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Get to know that kind of down the line
where those sources are coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you mentioned the word biodynamic and
I have quite a few folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the first time I've even
hearing of that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's that's a whole rabbit hole in
and of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't claim to be an expert,
but I have studied a little bit into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biodynamics was created by a gentleman
named Rudolf Steiner, and he's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting character in history.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wasn't a farmer per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was more kind of the way I describe him
is a very esoteric kind of a guy that used
[SPEAKER_01]: astrology, that used it's really at its at
its core.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's alchemy applied to
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, this was in the early
nineteen hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, people came to Rudolf
Steiner because he was just such a
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful figure in his community on all
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They asked him for a specific way of
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he came up with biodynamics as an
alternative to conventional farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so biodynamics, the short answer is
that was what he came up with it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It encompasses astrological alignments,
you know, and there's a series of
[SPEAKER_01]: different inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them actually somewhat similar to
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for example, one BD 500 is horn
manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you do is you take manure,
you would put that in a horn traditionally
[SPEAKER_01]: and put that under ground for the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to me, what that is, is it's a
microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you dig that up after a
season, after a winter, you now have it
[SPEAKER_01]: completely inoculated with the soil
microbiome of that land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take that and you go around
and spray that and kind of spread it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it it works in homeopathic ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are kind of hard to explain
by reductionistic science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of gets more into some esoteric
realms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even know that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one other thing that I noticed that
you do is leaf mold, utilize leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is leaf mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you create it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leaf mold is really a passionate topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really my go-to to really create the
foundation of fertility and soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really the decomposition of
leaves from deciduous trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so primarily the fungi that is
symbiotic, sometimes not always symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a whole consortium of
different fungus and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But specifically, it's more the fungi that
creates this aggregate through a slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could call it, you know, you could
call it a composting process because the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves are decomposing slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the fungi that's really eating the
lignus material and creating this
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful soil aggregate, meaning like big
clumps of these leaves that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: literally digested by the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just see these big webs,
big chunk of white mycelial humus in the
[SPEAKER_01]: topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so this is used in Korean
natural farming and JDOM as a primary
[SPEAKER_01]: means of an inoculant for growing,
you know, IMO cultures for creating JDOM
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the important thing to note is that
it's a consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not looking for a specific type of
fungus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, whenever I've talked to
kind of mushroom growers about IMO,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're always curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what mushroom are you going for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't necessarily work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the consortium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are mimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want that diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you had Chris Trump on the podcast
and he was talking about those DNA tests
[SPEAKER_01]: that were done over 400 different species
of fungi, over 800, you know, bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: found in some of this, you know,
this was IMO cultures cultured from leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what we're looking for is
really the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's power and diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a big approach for me in how I
practice agriculture is kind of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create these diverse systems, these
self-regulating systems by bringing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy cultures, the diversity and kind
of letting nature figure that out for
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, like I'm trained in some
microscopy, too, so I can look down under
[SPEAKER_01]: a microscope and kind of look for the
players involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you don't have to be a
scientist or even know how to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope to be really successful at
culturing IMOs and using them very
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively in your gardens and on your
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing about culturing on your
own is the diversity is going to be far
[SPEAKER_00]: superior, far more than if you're buying
some of these microbial inoculant products
[SPEAKER_00]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not making a claim they should
never do that and that they don't work or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to get much more
diversity going this all natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of culturing your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I'm not I'm not going to
knock some of these commercial inoculants
[SPEAKER_01]: like I use some of them back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, specifically to your
audience that, you know, grows indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did grow an indoor back in the day where
I was using IMOs from outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing those in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a careful process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're doing a big scale
commercial operation, obviously you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: be careful when you're doing that to
really build up the right diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, indoors might
make a little more sense for some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different microbial inoculants that you
can buy kind of bugs in a jug,
[SPEAKER_01]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly like have some efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I would use IMO over over
those all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's one big difference between some
of these bugs in a jug versus like IMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMOs are cultured out in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus cultured in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a big difference between
microbes that are cultured in a community
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's, you know, competition and
there's so much diversity that all these
[SPEAKER_01]: players are getting involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, only the strong literally survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in a lab where you're creating
like a monoculture in a sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, those cultures don't have the
competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have that diversity in nature,
which is really kind of what drives the
[SPEAKER_01]: power and strength of a lot of these
microorganisms, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to say that these these
store bought inoculants don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for me, like I don't I
don't buy anything except for like a
[SPEAKER_01]: culture that I'm buying to re-culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I take L.
[SPEAKER_01]: ruderi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a strain of lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was originally found in mother's breast
milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a probiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's there's a lot of new studies on,
you know, lactobacillus ruderi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I buy the culture for that to take
as a probiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I re-culture that as a yogurt to take
for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and you can do the same with
these, you know, these microbes for
[SPEAKER_01]: applying to plants and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like there's multiple ways to
kind of get to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, 100 percent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it all really starts with the
leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of lactobacillus
like everywhere on our skin and the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can culture that as well, which,
you know, labs is a great companion and
[SPEAKER_01]: really great for decomposing organic
matter in the soil, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also get a lot of that in your
your IMO cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I'm sure there's got to be some
risks and mistakes that can happen when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creating your own IMO culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's definitely,
you know, a specific process for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after about 10 years of making IMO
piles, my process has kind of changed a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can speak to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, what I would say to your original
question is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the temperatures that you
hold, you know, your IMO pile when your
[SPEAKER_01]: culturing is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be, you know,
culturing higher than about one hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: and thirty degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that window between one hundred and
twenty and one hundred and thirty is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty optimal to maintain that during the
process, which means you'll be turning the
[SPEAKER_01]: pile quite a bit on the on the flip side
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to disturb the pile too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to come in and just turn
your pile to where it works a lot like a
[SPEAKER_01]: fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're starting a fire, like you
don't want to extinguish that fire too
[SPEAKER_01]: fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you really want the the microbes to
start eating that food supply,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, basically mill run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oats, barley, wheat, any of those will
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mill that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbohydrates, fats, proteins
available are going to become a food
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I mean, I would say that
having that optimal temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: that Goldilocks zone, is really important
and, you know, making sure it doesn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: too wet, too anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got, you know, ammonia smells
coming off your pile, that's a red flag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there is kind of a Goldilocks
zone kind of sweet spot that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay between when culturing your IMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you bring that down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks are aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you've been creating IMO for
10 years and you've kind of adjusted the
[SPEAKER_00]: way you've been doing over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be willing to kind of break down
what steps you currently do to create IMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just tell this this quick story,
because this is how I came to the current
[SPEAKER_01]: process of of how my process has changed a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blessed with the opportunity to,
you know, train directly with the Cho
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Honky Cho, who recently passed
away, rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Honky Cho, also his son,
Yung Sang Cho and their family,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jadam Sona, and basically was part of a
group that helped to promote a tour around
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole United States with the Cho
family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I toured with the Cho family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so we had an Airbnb out in
D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: to do an event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had Firebird Farms out there,
an amazing farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a workshop out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one night I was hanging out with
Cultivating Classics, who makes these
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes gear, IMO gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he was helping with the tour and we
were sitting with Cho Yung Sang and all
[SPEAKER_01]: having a beverage of choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically he told me the story of kind
of how IMO came to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Master Cho's original way for
culturing, you know, IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was going through the process of
IMO one to, you know, into three and four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one for listeners that don't know,
I think it's been explained on here maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: by previous guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you basically use a cult like you cook
rice and you go out and you place it in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, healthy forests with microbiomes
or those healthy ecosystems near you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would culture the fungi in that
environment, the indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, bring that back,
mix it one to one with a brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you would have IMO two in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now IMO two is really cool because this is
like, you know, a cryogenic freeze of that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific year, that time of year,
which that fluctuates throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you literally have a library of that
microbiology from that very moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can keep a whole library of these
IMO twos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is one really cool thing about IMO
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, you can take the IMO
collections and the best practice is
[SPEAKER_01]: really to take several of those to grow on
a substrate, you know, mill run,
[SPEAKER_01]: reculture that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives you IMO three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you would add native soil,
reculture it again to make IMO four.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take that a step further into IMO
five by adding, I like to do seaweed,
[SPEAKER_01]: so a nitrogen source, you could use
manures for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But IMO five is basically, if you get to
that stage, which is a long process to get
[SPEAKER_01]: there, that is your like super amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally don't really have to add
much more than IMO five if you get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so that being said, simplifying the
process, what Yongseng Cho told me was
[SPEAKER_01]: that his father originally, Yongseng Cho
or Hongq Cho, excuse me, he originally
[SPEAKER_01]: would take leaf mold and directly culture
that on a substrate and make what we
[SPEAKER_01]: consider IMO three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happened is they were
putting together some books and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of Master Cho's daughter was helping
with the recipe writing and there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: decision made, at some point to basically
use the extra steps of IMO one,
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting in a rice box, adding it to
sugar and then creating IMO three,
[SPEAKER_01]: which adds a lot of steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do those extra steps if you
like, but I kind of just use the leaf mold
[SPEAKER_01]: straight to the substrate now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is also a lot more kind of
approachable for people, the more
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible and approachable and kind of
less steps involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find people naturally stick with it a
little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other thing that I do is instead
of, I love to mill down all of my grains
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, rather than just buying a mill run
from a feed supply, because we can really,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have more control of the food sources,
the degree in which we're milling that
[SPEAKER_01]: grain down to make available those
carbohydrates, the fats and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: that that grain has inside all the
constituents that these microbes can feed
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I'll mill my own grains,
which kind of came from a practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to brew a lot of beer back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was kind of, I had these mills
around and started using it for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I started doing was using some
whole grain in my pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not milling all of that, but actually
leaving some of the whole grain in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I noticed that grain would
germinate and sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd have these sprouts within my pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought, wow, this is
something, because now I can actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people might be familiar with
sprouted teas for those enzymes and
[SPEAKER_01]: hormones that you get from doing these
sprouted teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of where my thinking
started going with this was, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have some of those sprouts growing
in the mix too, now we're increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes along with germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're adding that to this pile too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we really have a super powerful
inoculant to either go broadcast or to
[SPEAKER_01]: take further into a liquid IMO like Chris
Trump kind of originally did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's tons of folks here that are
listening in that do the process and
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing somebody who's done it for 10
years, how they do it is certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for breaking that down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also explained that a lot more detail
kind of on my YouTube channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: if anybody wants to watch any of those
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Preston's
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below so people can easily get to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another potential option that people
can do is JDOM Microbial Solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: JMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break that down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it exactly?
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of how does it differ from IMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So JMS is sort of a simplified version for
replacing IMO that Yung Singh of JDOM came
[SPEAKER_01]: up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: He felt like there's too many kind of
steps involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if we take those couple steps out,
it makes it a lot more approachable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can culture JMS incredibly quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically with potatoes, and sea salt,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's nearly free to brew and you
still use leaf mold only you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a culture of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not aerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the most part, anaerobic,
however, not completely anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is recommended to really splash when
you're cooking the potatoes down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you essentially make like mashed potatoes,
and then you can blend that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very available starches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then along with the trace mineral
complex that you get from sea salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you have this incredible food source
for these microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you steep that in a bucket,
you really want to get it agitated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're splashing a lot of oxygen into
the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it's not completely like an
aerated compost tea with a bubbler
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling, it's not a vortex or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think that might be just
completely anaerobic and that's not the
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still get some aerobic culture in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's a little more anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we might be getting more facultative
culture than say what you'd get with the
[SPEAKER_01]: IMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a little bit of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to kind of explain the difference
in how I would use IMO a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently than JMS, even though they're
pretty much interchangeable, when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: first establishing a new grow,
say I have a like really compacted soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe you got some erosion going on,
JMS is amazing for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soaking in JMS because you really want to
soak that in like deep down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yung Sang always says, jaw, jaw,
which means like deep down into the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and they can survive in conditions without
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really good at like breaking up
hard compacted clay, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: rock, sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would start with the JMS first
for that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would come back, start mulching
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before getting ready for a
planting, I would be adding the IMOs
[SPEAKER_01]: directly like before my plantings,
during my plantings and after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of dealing more with the
aerobic cultures that are in the top,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, four inches of the top soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I differentiate
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it's a lot easier to do JMS
than it would be to do the IMO process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whether you mentioned potatoes and
sea salt, that's something that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people just have in their cupboard there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can easily kind of get started
creating their own JMS solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific type of potato that's
better than other like russet potatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: versus sweet potato?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any differences at all there?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like what has the most
starches because that's really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what the food source is that
we're getting from potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This gets into kind of a really
interesting area of optimizing your JMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's say you're growing
strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could create a JMS by putting potatoes
or strictly strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're optimizing your
microorganisms for that specific crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this gets into a really interesting
kind of area of application and research,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tailoring these microorganisms
for the specific crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't seen a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used like sweet potatoes before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say by adding different food
sources, you are, you know, potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've seen this under a microscope,
you are culturing, you know, different
[SPEAKER_01]: strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely they're going to be similar based
on, you know, samples that were taken from
[SPEAKER_01]: the same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this also gets to JDOM and I guess you
could say KNF as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically you want to be culturing in the
same exact environment that you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in because those microorganisms are
optimized for those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason why when I go collect
leaf mold under an oak tree, that's a 50
[SPEAKER_01]: year old oak tree on this property,
there's a reason why they're there because
[SPEAKER_01]: they went through the whole process of,
you know, evolution and adapting and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all of those different variables
from the temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: the moisture, you know, all those
different variables, these microbes made
[SPEAKER_01]: it through and have adapted and acclimated
for literally thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're optimized for that environment
and so that is where you want to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: your liquid fertilizers, your composting,
your JMS.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to put those barrels right next
to the fields you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in regards to application rate,
probably majority of the folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: tuning in are indoor growers and JMS,
what would you say is an appropriate
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate?
[SPEAKER_00]: When should they apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be, you know, every week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be every other week,
once a month, once a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us some information in
regards to that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, you know, it's variable for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on your situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're talking about an indoor,
it might be a really good time to
[SPEAKER_01]: condition before, let's say you're,
you know, prepping for a new planting and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just added a new soil mix,
a new blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting the structure in your soil,
a living soil system, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
[SPEAKER_01]: JMS is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great for that initial inoculation and
kind of jumpstarting that whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help start breaking down all
the compost and organic matter in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be a good time to apply it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're just getting started and just
starting to build, you know, that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: food web, I would use it more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe once a week, you know,
for the first couple of months from that
[SPEAKER_01]: point on, you know, you might do it every
month or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you really get it,
those cultures really established,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to apply that often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say maybe, you know, every succession
of your planting, I might do another
[SPEAKER_01]: application at that point, maybe just one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so more upfront when you're
first developing the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and to your point about, you know,
application rates, one to 30 is a common
[SPEAKER_01]: rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so a lot of these you know,
kind of applications work a little
[SPEAKER_01]: differently than, say, like a salt based
fertilizer, where we get really specific
[SPEAKER_01]: on the application dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can stay within the recommended
ranges, which is always good, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to get too worried about
like, OK, I did this one at like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 50 parts as opposed to 30 parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might go with a more concentrated,
you know, form of the JMS when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: first establishing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we had a really compacted
area outside here where we're doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: centrophic rows on half an acre.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I did is I just soaked it in with
water and then I applied JMS straight onto
[SPEAKER_01]: the field, but I did soak it down first
with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the the common rate is one part JMS to
30 parts dechlorinated filtered water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a pretty common application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go all the way to like one to
100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're soaking in first,
you could be applying JMS straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be a little more careful doing that
because it's it's it's pretty loaded with
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, and then only as a soil drench or do
people use it as a foliar spray as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: JMS more so as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could foliar spray it,
but I feel a lot of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of facultative anaerobes,
I mean, they could they'll live in the
[SPEAKER_01]: phylosphere as well as the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you're going to get,
you know, some benefits from foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have say you have some powdery
mildew, you know, JMS could be good for
[SPEAKER_01]: combating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, you know, IMO, limo T as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other simple inputs can indoor
growers make at home using either kitchen
[SPEAKER_00]: scraps or easily sourced materials?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say fermented plant juices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which we use sugar to osmonically extract
all the constituents out of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually just the growth tips that have
most of the growth hormones in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the oxygen's gibberellic acid is
what we're going for, as well as some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the constituents, you know, in that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically harvesting vigorous weeds
that grow around your house, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize those or your farm can utilize
those for a fertilizer to make a FPJ
[SPEAKER_01]: fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you go to the JDOM method,
you just throw it in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I kind of joke around like
everything in JDOM, you just like throw it
[SPEAKER_01]: in water and putrefy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously there's more to the
system than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and as mentioned, I think by
previous guests, you know, the IMO
[SPEAKER_01]: cultures are 80 percent of KNF and JDOM.
[SPEAKER_01]: These other inputs that we make are kind
of just additives, little extras.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also mimic like exudates with the
soil content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a lot of what FPJ is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, other inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can make if you have egg shells,
you can make water soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have bones, you can make cow fos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are made with extractions of
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those are are really great
to make as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown rice vinegar is another input in
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do culture some of my own brown rice
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gets a little involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a three step fermentation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit more involved in,
you know, Master Cho doesn't really teach,
[SPEAKER_01]: never really taught BRV for the most part
that that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of found those recipes on my
own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, those would be some good ones
you can you can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also do a lot of vermicomposting with
kitchen scraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a worm tower right outside my
kitchen door, so I just tossed a lot of my
[SPEAKER_01]: food scraps in there and give it to the
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gives the audience some options.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do some Googling and research,
anything that interests them and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more how to do that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about for pest control?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to really go the all
natural route when it comes to controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: pests or preventing pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some best KNF or JDOM pest
control solutions for indoor garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the KNF side, it's there's not a
whole lot of pesticides that we make in
[SPEAKER_01]: the KNF system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more preventative measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those preventative measures are really
built in the diversity that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: building, first of all, in the soil with
the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're building a lot of resistance
on our plants with the higher BRICS level
[SPEAKER_01]: that is created through these cultures of
IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we can use bioremediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labs is a good one to combat mildew and
things like that in the phylosphere,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then JDOM has a lot more to offer on
the side of our pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So JDOM teaches how to make a
horticultural soap, a wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with that, you can team that soap
with many different herbal extractions to
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sky is the limit with
different extractions that you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: with the horticultural soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites when I was in Humboldt
County was using the California Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: Laurel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduced that to the natural farming
community years ago because I was studying
[SPEAKER_01]: herbalism and found that the Native
Americans of that region use the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: Laurel, which has as really fragrant,
super high essential oil content in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Native Americans would take and
they would protect some of the acorn meal
[SPEAKER_01]: they were making.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would surround it with the Bay Laurel
to keep pests away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was reading about that, like,
oh, that could be used in JDOM as a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started distilling Bay Laurel
leaves and found that, yeah, the essential
[SPEAKER_01]: oils have are great for aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really, really effective on
aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Successfully took care of a huge
infestation of aphids on a hemp crop in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon and had a lot of other friends
doing pretty large scale stuff using the
[SPEAKER_01]: Bay Laurel with a lot of positive results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, basically within like 99% of the
community of aphids was destroyed in two
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, Bay Laurel is actually,
it's around here a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was considering putting them in as
like privacy bushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't realize that they could have
other uses for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really exciting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing tree up in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Oregon Myrtlewood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a different name.
[SPEAKER_01]: My ex-girlfriend who was an herbalist used
to joke around with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's Oregon Myrtlewood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say, no, it's California Bay
Laurel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were both right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine all of these things when it
comes to natural farming, a lot of folks,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're afraid that they're going to make
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to go over some of the common
mistakes that new growers make when trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement some of these permaculture
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down for us, maybe some
of the things, maybe top two or three that
[SPEAKER_00]: come to your mind of mistakes that new
folks make and how they can be avoided or
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the biggest one that comes to mind
for me is living soil systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farming, systems that were
emulating natural processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know we kind of live in an
instant gratification modern culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that's probably one of the
biggest ones is that we need to be patient
[SPEAKER_01]: and enjoy the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK to learn through our failures,
our mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those just make us better the next
times around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would say that's probably one of
the the biggest ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's the old story of the moral
of the the tortoise and the hare.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's better to be slow and
effective and efficient than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: fast and hasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think with the regenerative
farming methods, you know, take the
[SPEAKER_01]: tortoises example there and be patient
with the process and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other mistakes, the companion plants are a
big one when it comes to permaculture and
[SPEAKER_01]: centropic agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a big one for me was learning how
important the companion plants are to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to that system, because those
are more systems approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking more at ecology rather than
just like a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're focused on the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really focusing more on the system and
those support plants and how important
[SPEAKER_01]: they are to cycle nutrients into the
system, not just looking at our target
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally growing our own
fertilizers with centropic agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a principle based method than
an input based method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm sure we can get much,
much deeper into so many different aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops, companion planting,
mulch, layers, centropic agroforestry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to invite you back on for a part
two at some point in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you'd be willing to get into some of
these things deeper coming up towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to wrap things up,
but yeah, if you're down for a part two at
[SPEAKER_00]: some point in the future, not only me
would enjoy it, but I know my audience
[SPEAKER_00]: would enjoy it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we didn't really touch on a
centropics and there's so much there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's an incredible way to,
to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it does have some application
in, in indoors too, looking at plant
[SPEAKER_01]: consortiums and you know, those,
those intervals that we can plant in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll plan for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and is there anything upcoming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am rogue regenerative agriculture on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an Instagram rogue regeneration and
then my website is rogue natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: .com.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some information and I try to keep
that update with kind of current projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do offer some can of inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I don't, my goal isn't to
be a fertilizer salesman at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: My labels say, you know, make your own
first and supplement second.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't often, sometimes I'm slow to
even get those orders out and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: seasonal, but I do offer some of those on,
on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, uh, life source farms.net
is a, is the farm that I currently work
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're launching, um, a new platform to
sell our produce that's regeneratively
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we'll have avocado boxes available
very soon and much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you can find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to Preston's
YouTube channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions in regards
to this, or if you want to let us know
[SPEAKER_00]: what inputs you use, let us know down in
the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Section below the people being scrolled on
the screen right now are on the producer
[SPEAKER_00]: tier on Patrion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to you, patreon.com slash
Mr. Grow it a hundred percent of what is
[SPEAKER_00]: donated through there goes right back into
the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for your
contribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preston, once again, thanks so much for
coming on just hearing a, what seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: a small piece of your knowledge has been
very valuable to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure it's very valuable to my
audience as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for taking the time
just down with me today to speak for an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: A privilege to be here, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't wait to talk some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll catch y'all in next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
