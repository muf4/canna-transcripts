[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got another Q&A video for you this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last Q&A video was very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a lot of thumbs up and we got a lot
of positive comments in the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of good questions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to answer the questions in
this video and I'm also going to answer
[SPEAKER_00]: some questions from the video I released
on my main channel the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about 40 days and about a week
ago my plants started sexing in the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a pollen sac showed but no pollen came
out and a hair came out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it a hermy or a fem?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd actually have to see a picture to give
you a more accurate answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're only seeing one what you think
is a pollen sac and a hair coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it's probably not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen sacs are in clusters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give it some more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if pollen sacs form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's like a cluster of pollen sacs
and then you'll have your answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now even if your plant is showing a lot of
pistols, hairs, always keep an eye out for
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential for the plant to herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had plants in the past where you
know they've gone two weeks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage and they had tons of
pistols real nice buds starting to form
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden they had clusters of
pollen sacs forming right underneath them
[SPEAKER_00]: or right next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you really just got to make sure
you're constantly inspecting your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: for both sides of it being a herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for pests while you're inspecting
your plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could always post a picture on my
forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: MrGrowIt.com slash forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Post a picture on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on there just about every day,
every one to two days answering questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you post a picture on there I can
advise a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the question, someone asked about
fans not lasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have problems with fans until I
realized I wasn't using all-row water.
[SPEAKER_00]: My humidifiers started using all-row now
and they're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No calcium buildup in the motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wondering if anybody else had this
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great call out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you are using non-all-row water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the tap water for example that has
minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could experience problems both in your
humidifier just might not last as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main issues that a lot of
people have is when using tap water in
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifiers is they'll get calcium buildup
in their carbon filter and that carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter that the pre-filter or the carbon
filter sock gets all clogged up and you
[SPEAKER_00]: got to remove it and clean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it quickly clogs up the carbon
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely not recommended to use
tap water in your humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely use all-row water, some type of
filtered water or distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you won't have that calcium
buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's a very common thing that
happens now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that there's a buildup in
motors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had that happen, but that's a
good call out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could definitely see that potentially
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do an all-organic grow really
interested in organic grows?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually done an organic grow
before on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used organic dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely didn't turn out very well to be
honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get a good result from the
organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're talking about the
organic amendment way to do organic
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or if you're talking about no-till
living organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll definitely do some organic
grows in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great videos and thanks for taking the
time to share your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm about to start my first grow and
I'll be using Fox Farm Ocean Force soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have the Fox Farm nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is do I wait 30 days then
start feeding them or do I start the first
[SPEAKER_00]: week of veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what you consider the
first week of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: People consider it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people consider the first week of veg
the week that the plant sprouts from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people consider that the seedling
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people consider the seedling stage
the first two or sometimes some people
[SPEAKER_00]: even think the first three weeks are the
seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they start counting veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what you're talking about
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make things easier for you,
it's basically about 20 to 40 days from
[SPEAKER_00]: when the plant sprouts from the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could be transplanting into fresh
soil during that first 30 days and that
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh soil has nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be a little bit longer than
the 30 day period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 to 40 days is just kind of a rough
guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're planting directly into your
final container, let's say your final
[SPEAKER_00]: container is a five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown like that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's roughly about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit your plants with nutrients on
the 30th day, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing in Fox Farm Ocean Forest
Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hit my plants with nutrients as early
as day 16 from sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I got some really good
results in doing it that early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those genetics could have just kind of
been nutrient hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, general guideline, 20 to 40 days
from when the plant sprouts from the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, go ahead and hit that with a Fox
Farm nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start with a half dose,
maybe even start with a quarter dose and
[SPEAKER_00]: always check the PPM of the runoff when
you're using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do the runoff PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people argue that a slurry test would
be better than a runoff test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you can measure it either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a five by five grow tent,
how many plants will fit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on how big the plants are,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could actually shove a whole bunch
of plants in there and keep them small,
[SPEAKER_00]: flip them to flower super early and you'll
be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could just put one plant in a five
by five and veg it out longer and fill up
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on how many plants
you're looking to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I personally like a variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a five by five, I would typically
shove in five, maybe six plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and veg them for 30, 40 days and flip
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should basically fill up the grow
space depending on genetics, actually
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, lighting, nutrition,
all that stuff is going to impact plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it really depends on how many
plants you want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could keep a bunch of plants in there
and just keep them small and flip or one
[SPEAKER_00]: large plant, veg for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great video, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far do you keep your electric skylight
from your plants that flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: In flowering, I really like to do 20
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone down to 18 inches before,
however, kind of late in flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I experienced some foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Foxtailing, it can be genetics,
but it can also be due to too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of have a gut feeling that I
just had my lights too close and I started
[SPEAKER_00]: a foxtail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20, 21 inches away in flowering is what
I like to run with the electric skylights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much blast is to how many gallons of
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do one tablespoon per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what height do you start flowering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on growth, depends on the
genetics, some indica strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let veg a little bit longer and grow
a little bit longer because they tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: be more compact and don't stretch as much
in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I flipped them into flowering,
that three-week stretch period,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown some Tiva strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to kind of be quicker to
grow and longer into nodes, take up more
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't veg for as long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I go by the number of days in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's around 30 to 40 days in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually about the right height before
flipping a flower, but yeah, it depends on
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics really and growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you use microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been using mammoth pea and I've
been using blue planet nutrients rhizomex.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of rotate with them, kind of every
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watering, I'll water with mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next watering, I'll toss in some
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll skip it and yeah,
it's just kind of randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things like microbes can be added
every watering and you shouldn't see an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, inoculating your medium with
microbes isn't going to do any harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, do I have to start my
photos in a small pot or a cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally just grow autos, keeping them
in the same home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily have to start in a
small pot and then cup and then transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just do it right in the final
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will plant directly into the
final container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will plant in a small cup and
then transplant up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are pros and cons to putting in a
small cup and then transplanting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are pros and cons to just
planting directly into the final
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did create a video on
transplanting multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I explain more detail about the pros of
transplanting multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually in the comment section of the
video, there is some good call outs,
[SPEAKER_00]: additional information that I didn't
mention within the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll link that down below for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, chilled LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already picked a winner for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that winner already received
the light as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching your channel for some
time and actually learned quite a bit from
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question about hydroponic growing
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this doesn't have anything to do
with your current grow, but I'm starting a
[SPEAKER_00]: DWC grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: DWC stands for Deep Water Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using Riot Ruger Plus and I'm starting
with seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question is, when should I put my
seeds and plug into my five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: and net pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, how long should I keep the
seedlings and plugs separate?
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, Aaron, I don't have any
experience in DWC at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to give you an answer and
then all of a sudden that answer would be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll do is I'll ask this amazing
community that we have here with a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody has DWC experience that has an
answer to his question, please leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Help Aaron out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great video and thanks for sharing your
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have read your book as well as
heard you talk about how you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a revision soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of stuff can we expect to
change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any update on when this will take place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my book has been updated,
although it has not been released yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things that are
pending that I'm waiting on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soon, I hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I updated several of the sections within
the book, just adding information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not going to be a complete
revision as far as the text, but there is
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of additional text in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the feeding nutrient section
has been expanded to be a lot more clear
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is in the version that you have
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, a lot of the photography is
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went onto Instagram and found
some cannabis photographers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got like eight or nine
photographers that ended up purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of their photos I wanted to include
in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just my photos in there that
there's other photos as well from good
[SPEAKER_00]: photographers in the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the design is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hired a designer to do a redesign and
I'm looking to do a hard copy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that's kind of in progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that the ebook is released
within a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this video is getting long,
so I'm going to stop it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys for all the questions that
you left in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any other questions,
please let me know in the comment section
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe I will answer them in a future
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if there are any specific topics
that you want me to cover, let me know and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
