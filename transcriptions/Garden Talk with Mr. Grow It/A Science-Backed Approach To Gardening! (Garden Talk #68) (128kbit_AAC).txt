[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably getting less than 10% of
the actual plant production standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be bright, they'll burn your
retinas out, but they will not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: be as advantageous to your plants as you
may think.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what plant you're growing,
what environment, that science-based
[SPEAKER_00]: approach is really what allows anyone to
improve their gardening skills or just
[SPEAKER_00]: better understand the plant that they are
tending to.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 68.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Matt from
Tobacco University.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 22 years,
and he takes a more science-backed
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks about a variety of topics in this
episode, and explains the science in a
[SPEAKER_01]: more beginner-friendly manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to AEC Infinity for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me over their Grow Tent,
which has a canvas density of 2000D,
[SPEAKER_01]: making them the thickest Grow Tent on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an aluminum plate that mounts your
controller to the Grow Tent, with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lightproof pass-through for cable routing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The frame has 50% thicker steel poles,
and carries two times more weight than the
[SPEAKER_01]: standard Grow Tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coupon code MRGROWIT will get you a
discount on their products, and I'll leave
[SPEAKER_01]: a link to their website down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Matt from Tobacco
University.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a large handful of people
on my channel comment on my videos
[SPEAKER_01]: requesting you to come onto this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people really admire
your science-backed approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about really all plants,
gardening, indoors, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really go over a lot of that in your
videos on your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very detailed, very straight to the
point, which I think I've seen some
[SPEAKER_01]: comments in those videos saying that
people love the straight to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: topic videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a really great job all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to have a
conversation today and ask you some
[SPEAKER_01]: questions that are really backed by
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always great to hear and help support
that, because that's the one thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: does hold true no matter what plant you're
growing, what environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That science-based approach is really what
allows anyone to improve their gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: skills or just better understand the plant
that they are tending to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get too deep into things,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been growing for the last at least
22 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: My claim to fame is giant pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what kind of got me started and
interesting in plant growing in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the giant pumpkin, literally
you can kind of watch it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will put on, on average, about a
pound every hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you kind of see that happen from a
plant standpoint, you're always just
[SPEAKER_00]: inquisitive of like, well, why is that
happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can I improve that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get more pounds per hour or a longer
duration for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, that led me into the
science, which I also like to kind of read
[SPEAKER_00]: up on and look at and making those
connections, the photosynthetic process,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, humidity, nutrients,
how all that plays into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The giant pumpkin, it's kind of in your
face and allows you a great understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: of how your influences can impact the
production of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the other day you actually sent me
a picture of one of the plants that you
[SPEAKER_01]: had grown, one of the pumpkins and a
massive, massive pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what was it on like a pallet or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And was it like on a scale at the time or
something?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you always have it on a scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've got to transport them by
pallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm way back about seven, eight years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased a five foot by eight foot
trailer to hold the pumpkins around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I had to buy a new one because
that one won't fit the pumpkins anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got the legalist wise trailer you
can kind of get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of just part of the hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I say, that's usually a good
problem to have in the sense that when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're out growing the containers for
transportation always turns a lot of heads
[SPEAKER_00]: on the highway and always get the thumbs
up around the fall time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a nice way on a good year to end
the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of things with pumpkins
kind of relates to medicinal varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these growers do grow that are
tuning into this content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to first talk about the naming
convention and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people using the word strain when
really that's actually incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about properly naming
plants from strain to cultivar versus
[SPEAKER_01]: variety versus land race, so on and so
forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole official plant taxonomy
and nomenclature is kind of the main term
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, how do we break that
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these terms get tossed around
and because they heard it from someone
[SPEAKER_00]: that they may regard, they just keep
tossing that same term around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the one that you mentioned in
particularly strain and that is used quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really comes more from the
microbiology, bacteria kind of naming a
[SPEAKER_00]: nomenclature system, but has been applied
to all sorts of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really that is kind of an improper
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really it's called the International Code
for Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of one of the gold standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's abbreviated the ICNCP.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the ones that really set the
rules for naming any plant, any new plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those rules can get lengthy,
can get very laborious as how you write
[SPEAKER_00]: things or what should be italicized in
single quotes and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really what sets the standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some growers of plants have kind of
disregarded some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they use the terms like strain and
cultivar and variety all interchangeably
[SPEAKER_00]: when really they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a cultivar, a true cultivar,
it really means a cultivated plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: one that's been kind of modified by
humans, selected for, cultivated by
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most are developed by kind of like plant
breeders and borderline on probably what
[SPEAKER_00]: we may think of as hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: A variety is basically a variation within
a plant species that develops naturally in
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't require human
intervention by the definition of the
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people say, I've got this new
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really kind of develops by its own
kind of relative mutations, I guess is the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you write these, there's all these
sort of established rules, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: disregard them, of the genus, the specific
epithet, the cultivar, common names,
[SPEAKER_00]: and exactly what gets italicized and in
single quotes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is interesting is that these hybrids
that we speak of natural or manmade are
[SPEAKER_00]: really what a lot of people are growing
and are human generated in a lot of cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times those human generated
seeds, if you grow a hybrid, you plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that seed and it gets a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a seed from that plant and grow
it and you get something that like doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: quite look like the original.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly it happens a lot with squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the compost pile, throw these
rotted squash in the compost pile the next
[SPEAKER_00]: year, you're like, I got my free squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, they don't turn out
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that kind of gives you an idea of a
true quote hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we hear the term land race
used quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And land race is really that people might
be more familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the term should be used as
heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an heirloom is just one of those open
pollinated varieties that's been passed
[SPEAKER_00]: down from generation to generation and is
very stable in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will argue, oh, it's got to be
50 years stable, 150 years stable,
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some variation there, but
something that is probably going to come
[SPEAKER_00]: true from type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So land race, heirlooms, those also are
interchangeable terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of the plants we're seeing out
there with all these crazy new names and
[SPEAKER_00]: they get very well publicized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we're getting to is really
something in the borderlines of trade
[SPEAKER_00]: names or trademark names or trade
designations would be a great way to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of context this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really, for the most part,
there is a registering process that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go through, but we're dealing with
a lot of unregistered trademarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are names that you say,
and people immediately make that
[SPEAKER_00]: connection with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, that's, you know, that was grown
here and then passed from here and went
[SPEAKER_00]: from the West coast to the East coast or
South to the North.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really by botanical definition,
unregistered trademarks is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to a lot of plant names by,
but a lot of the background of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: growers is not botanically based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're using these in terms of
cultivar strain and a variety or hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: when really they're probably dealing with
simply a unregistered trademark name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've improperly used the word
strain for many, many years, and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: was corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivars is really kind of what I've,
what I've been growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying to say that instead of
strain and I get some pushback,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people like, Hey, it's strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And try to educate and people get
frustrated because they've been doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for so long and now they, they need to
change their ways and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But thanks for clarifying that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive into lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a HPS versus LED video on your
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it goes over a very good study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that study,
HPS versus LED?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is probably the two, um,
hot topics when it comes to lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: the old, uh, HPS lighting and then the new
kid on the block, the LED lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: which one's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got people kind of in both
camps that are old school HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then people are dumping all the HPS
and going straight to LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not quite as clear cut as many
growers kind of associate HPS technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as we speak today is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically 20 plus years refinement of
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there are still some benefits to
the HPS, uh, technology LED technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's improving year to year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look back five years,
how rudimentary it was to kind of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: see nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having said that if a manufacturer is
producing LED lights, it's not just an LED
[SPEAKER_00]: to HPS comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are variable forms of LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and they're all not necessarily
treated equally, shall we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it's, it's not LEDs or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is needs to be an understanding from
a grower to make that educated decision on
[SPEAKER_00]: which one is the best for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the study that, um, I found and posted
on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, if you type in just,
um, LED and HPS lights and tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: university should come up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it does, it tells you what HPS
they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thousand watt, um, double ended
HPS, which is pretty much the gold
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for commercial production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they had three LED lights of
those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: They determined based on their own tests
in the study that only one kind of rose to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and was worthy of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they ended up going with the Fluence,
um, spider X plus LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they had two others that they simply
determined were not near of comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that just shows you right there that
here's three LED lights and only one made
[SPEAKER_00]: it to be competitive to the HPS light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and when they were looking at
comparing, you know, they're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, really not so much the photosynthetic
process, but what are the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, secondary components, what are they
producing and comparing, uh, HPS to LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: The LED lights did come up a little bit
higher, um, in their comparison,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a lot of growers point to and say,
that's why I need to be using LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're producing so much better than HPS
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of, as a caveat,
just remind you that there were two LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights that were tossed out of the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably because they were not
producing anywhere near, um, as
[SPEAKER_00]: competitive as the HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really what needs to be taken
into consideration, um, by growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers still producing very high
quality end products, uh, grown completely
[SPEAKER_00]: under, uh, flowering time to end,
to harvest with HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you need to throw them
all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all the old technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, LED lights are of course the new and
upcoming idea, but not necessarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, a direct kind of throw the old one
out, go all with the new one and go all in
[SPEAKER_00]: on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers really need to be a little bit
more, uh, choosy with their LED lights and
[SPEAKER_00]: really do their research, looking at the
spectrums that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of a little bit of a saying is
good LED lights right now are not cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: and cheap LED lights are not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, what is cheap?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is, you know, you're looking at LED
lights costing well over a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, uh, for one light when you can
buy them for a hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can buy 10 to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're probably getting less than
10% of the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Production standpoint, they'll be bright.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll burn your retinas out,
but they, um, will not necessarily be,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as advantageous to your plants as you
may think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are the formulas of lighting out
there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the ones that people are
still using very frequently is CMH grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CMH and that stands for,
uh, ceramic metal halide on the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think growers need to really start
considering them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are gaining popularity, uh,
for those that may have been growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of years ago, metal halides were
the old school version.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the improvement of, uh,
the metal halides, MH lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's great about the CMH is,
is if anyone's growing currently with
[SPEAKER_00]: fluorescence, particularly for the
seedling clone early stages, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: CMH lights are in much easier replacement
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about,
you know, 10 bulbs, eight bulbs,
[SPEAKER_00]: one bulb will cover that same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the CMH is the ceramic of the CMH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really adds a very long, uh, bulb life
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the downfall of CMHs is that they're
not really great for the flowering phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, as a standalone light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, however, they are being used to kind
of intermix with some spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they do produce a fair amount of heat,
so they are not, you know, completely,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no heat, but no real light is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, because of the metal halide
in the bulb disposal, while a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: away is of course worth, um, consideration
as far as which are actually going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, having said that we're looking at
the, um, sometimes they're called LEC
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, just their light emitting
ceramics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CMH is going to be the term that's
going to carry on, but sometimes they use
[SPEAKER_00]: LECs and CMH interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are pretty much talking about the
same thing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else that's great about CMH is
for anyone that has used them is they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a great, uh, what's called a CRI,
which is a color rendering index.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something we talk about in LEDs
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CRIs for most CMHs are up there in
the, you know, high nineties itch area,
[SPEAKER_00]: which basically means the colors that
you're going to look at your plants under
[SPEAKER_00]: that light are going to be very true to
type versus HPS lights are going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: very much that heavy yellowish,
orangish kind of tones to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes back to the LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm talking about LED lights,
I'm talking about full spectrum LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think when they see LED
lights, think of those purple high PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those really wreak havoc on the eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to wear special glasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it very difficult to be able to
go through and view your plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: disease diagnosis, for scouting purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is one great advantage of the CMH
lights is they have that high CRI index.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they do come up very much in a 315 and
a 630 watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of growers might be thinking,
well, I have an HPS light at a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why am I going to consider these
lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on PAR readings, they do produce
very high on PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, a 315 wattage CMH light,
that's going to cover about a three by
[SPEAKER_00]: three flower area or four by four veg
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a 630 is going to be about a five by
five veg or four by four flower there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't let those smaller wattages worry
about the small footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still can cover quite a bit of square
footage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to just CMHs, there's a lot of
bulb options.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, most are lasting 20,000 hours and
still producing over 80% of their initial
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliance, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally a fan of the Phillips
master color one, but there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: coming on scene to be a little bit more
competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a lot that are producing,
particularly spectrums, getting into more
[SPEAKER_00]: of a flowering light, more of a daytime
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pop a bulb out, pop a new one right
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really allows you to keep the same
fixtures, but also have the ability,
[SPEAKER_00]: even in flower, to produce some of that UV
light and some of that far red spectrums
[SPEAKER_00]: that are very important for their full
secondary compounds, productions of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They allow the production of that,
which is why they're being interested to
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed in with some HBS lights or some LED
lights used throughout the entire growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, but use kind of alone or singly in
the veg cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using as that spectrum mix
because they're able to produce some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those wavelengths that other brands of
other classifications of lights tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are some studies out there
with people who are using lighting and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing its effects on trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the plants that have trichomes,
cannabinoids, terpenes, they're taking a
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what lighting can do for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids, they get a bunch of
acknowledgement.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people talk about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes, not as many people really talk
about them or really focus on them or
[SPEAKER_01]: really test them as much as they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to get a little bit deeper into
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of the common ones,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are terpenes in the basic sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call them terpenoids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to use terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people I find these terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the largest, most diverse group of
naturally occurring compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a very broad category and we're
covering all spectrums here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are chemical compounds, but everyone
freaks out when they hear the term
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical, but they are naturally derived
in the plant, naturally found in plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and in some animals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're really responsible for is the
aromas, the flavors, sometimes even
[SPEAKER_00]: colorations associated with various types
of irrigation in plants can be based on
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why plants produce them is
they're the plant's response to like harsh
[SPEAKER_00]: weather conditions that could be stresses
such as high light or temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations and also predators,
herbivores in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what they do in humans, how they
impact when humans consume them is
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still currently doing research on
that because there are quote just so many
[SPEAKER_00]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we kind of go about classifying
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this might get a little bit more into
the science of things, but they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: initially classified from a scientific
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the number of carbon
atoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how big is the molecule?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a mono terpene and a lot of
people think mono terpene, they think,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's got one little carbon atom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really those mono terpenes really have
a 10 carbon atoms and then di terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: have 20 and tri terpenes have 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like, think about it as
little packages of 10 carbon atoms and
[SPEAKER_00]: those mono terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times for medicinal purposes,
you're looking at fragrances or repellent
[SPEAKER_00]: type of properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your di terpenes can get into some
advantages on humans for might use them
[SPEAKER_00]: for medicinal waste, such as
anti-inflammatory issues or cardiovascular
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some indications that
classification can help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then tri terpenes is like wound
healing can help increase circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: help speed up the recovery time of a
potential wound or laceration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dermal layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and because this is so diverse,
you can't just say, Oh, this terpene has
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this and only this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a lot of also
interactions with these.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do we get them about these
interactions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we need these studies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they do impact the brain and
neurological pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some can have potential psychoactive
effects, but they really don't produce
[SPEAKER_00]: like intoxicating effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some cannabinoids have a little bit
stronger binding to receptors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early research is being done on these
because they are produced in a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's warranting the greater
investigation is that they potentially for
[SPEAKER_00]: some help with mental health or anxiety,
depression, bipolar disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some early research indicating
that it might be worth studying these or
[SPEAKER_00]: it might be worth going on this
classification because there could really
[SPEAKER_00]: be something there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now terpenes as we're, you know,
tossing out the general term, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the tea tree is an example that
contains active ingredients to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: potential infections there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citrus fruits, you know, that's a very
commonly associated, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma or smell on that you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those like, for example,
lemon grass, you know, has that nice
[SPEAKER_00]: lemony kind of odor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is actually, well, it smells,
you know, nice and lemony to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually the plant's response to
repelling insects from feeding on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have certain anti-microbial
properties, you know, anti-fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot there within the vast
amount of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you, you know, search up any,
you know, terpene poster or profile or
[SPEAKER_00]: list, you know, a lemony and just for one
that I mentioned there, one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: common found terpenes, distinct citrus
notes there, potentially, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-anxiety properties, but the plant's
producing it to like repel insects per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a reason why these plants are
producing these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quote for our benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just simply taking advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another common one, like the pine names,
you know, it comes from the carnivorous
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever walked into a pine tree,
the carnivorous, you know, tree aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is kind of that key scent there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those may have antidepressant
properties as well, as well as a host of
[SPEAKER_00]: others there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really comes down to, you know,
doing that science there and doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: research, doing those studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what's going to be
important taking these forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a consumer standpoint, if you're
looking at purchasing products for
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, as you mentioned, the
cannabinoids get all the quote attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you're purchasing anything,
plant-based should be looking for a COA,
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate of authenticity or a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times that will have lab test
results that people may just flip over,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they will often, or reputable
companies will test for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should also be looking as a side note for
heavy metals, microbiology, and
[SPEAKER_00]: aflatoxins, and making sure there's no
pesticides and all those boxes are
[SPEAKER_00]: checked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes there will be terpenes as
well tested for, and that leads us to like
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles where you're looking at,
okay, what produces high of one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how may that interact with another
terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that interacting with this profile
of like, it's not just one terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a mixture of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be some advantages of some
synergistic effects, which is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: great aspect where I always say one plus
one doesn't always equal two.
[SPEAKER_00]: One plus one could have an additive
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could equal three, where you're getting
additional benefits that if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed just one terpene and then just
another terpene, well, adding them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, how does this synergistic effect
kind of like a cal mag?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, you don't just find
calcium products or magnesium products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You find a calcium magnesium product,
and that's another example of a nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: having a synergistic effect to increase
its uptake in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those concerned, certain terpenes
heat, they are unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not unstable to mean that they're
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unstable to mean in really high heat
situations, the molecules, these carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules basically fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking at adding a lot of
heat to your method of consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: that could really negatively impact the
amount of terpenes you might be getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep the heat on the lower
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not basically vaporizing or
dissociating those valuable terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as everyone should be keeping,
I know for those who are growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also using a log, you know,
just a little diary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound a little old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may sound a little basic, but just
having an idea of, you know, what profile
[SPEAKER_00]: did you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What effects did you feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you like it, not like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can start to find some
commonalities and kind of go that route as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as what you might be investigating or
going further to help make something that
[SPEAKER_00]: matches your condition the best way
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned a key point there that I
think a lot of people aren't aware of is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the temperature as it's increasing,
these terpenes are volatizing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're disappearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people walk into the garden,
they'll open up their grow tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and they'll get a huge whiff
and they're like, smells wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's going great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it really going great?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you losing all those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause your heat is too high, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you mentioned, lowering the
temperature, you know, certainly towards
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of flowering can help conserve
some of those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding, different terpenes
will volatize at different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish there was a chart where it broke
down the terpene and then what temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: it volatizes at.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're aware of that or
not, but if you can find one and send it
[SPEAKER_01]: to me, I would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because I think that's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the general knowledge is to keep
it under, I think it was like under 75
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees Fahrenheit in order.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can, you're conserving most of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've seen 80 Fahrenheit,
I should say is kind of the friction point
[SPEAKER_00]: where you start going above 80 degrees and
it's kind of exponential decay at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just more and more, uh, breaking it
down for those that, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: might be, you know, hearing this and
going, well, well, that's much lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you might want to try that lower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you might be surprised at whatever
you, you know, the same batch,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got one effect where you lower that
temperature and you're like, wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I've been missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been looking for when really it's
been there the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just self degrading it,
um, with, um, excessive heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a good kind of, uh, word of
caution there that, you know, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with chemicals, uh, they do
dissociate, they do fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so there is a, you know, a method of,
you know, regulating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just vaporizing them until
oblivion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to run the low 80 degree Fahrenheit
all the way through, all the way up until
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I started dropping it in
late flowering to the high seventies
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit, I definitely, I can clearly
notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, definitely for those folks that
are tuning in that are maybe running it at
[SPEAKER_01]: low eighties all the way up until harvest,
maybe try the next round in the high
[SPEAKER_01]: seventies and see if there's a difference
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I certainly had noticed one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Myself now, is there anything that can be
done in guard while gardening in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase terpenes or cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much, um, you know, a lot of
growers want the quote, the quick fix and
[SPEAKER_00]: how can I maximize this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, a lot of it is genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the genes aren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you do the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to really, you know,
help anything, but kind of going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: the previous point that we had mentioned
is, you know, the lighting, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is some great information coming out
that, you know, the importance of lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: is, uh, um, important for those plants to
be able to maximize their, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: final output of, uh, you know,
total products there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is looking at not to say just a
bright light, um, but the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity of that light does play into it
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the spectrum of light also plays into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I just wanted to spy the,
the numerical light that's going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, solve all of your problems
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's where we're getting into more
experimentation with different,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, light levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spectrums of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mentioned PAR earlier, which is
referring to that, mainly that
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetically active kind of portion
of the light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we're, you know, doing more
research and looking at more things,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's, you know, wavelengths beyond
that, just that simple, that PAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, reading, uh, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes what we're finding is
potentially intensifying, um, wavelengths
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of just that PAR might be
advantageous there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ultraviolet light, which is kind of
under the, under that 400 nanometers or
[SPEAKER_00]: so, or that far red, pretty much talking
about that 700 or so nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we think of UV light,
when I think of purple, um, coloration and
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that is true on that's touching the,
um, UV light spectrum, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: important wavelengths that are basically
out of the visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We simply can't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is some bees can
actually see those wavelengths and flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: can look very different under a UV light
to a bee than we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but there are wavelengths that plants
are able to receive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are receptors for these,
um, wavelengths outside of that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean you go down to,
you know, 200 nanometers or up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand nanometers and your cell phone or
radio waves are new, something to a plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily, but really that 300 to
800 or so nanometers when PAR is only 400
[SPEAKER_00]: to 700, um, do play a role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what they're doing is there
are some, uh, CMH lights, uh, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: basically a high UV light spectrum and
they are recommending you only use those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights in your last 10 days or seven to 10
days of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what it's doing that UV light is
actually stressing the plant out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why you only want to use
it for the last week or so is it's
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing the plant out in the sense it's
not going to grow a whole lot more,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's going to signal the plant to
produce those terpenes, to produce those
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, to produce those secondary
components, um, quite, quite a bit as a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress response, because as I mentioned,
you know, the lemon scent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and lemongrass that's really to repel
insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of forcing the plant,
uh, stressing out a little bit to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce the necessary compounds that
you're looking to produce there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead that UV and far red light
probably are the ones that are the ones to
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of, or some companies are
coming out with lights with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: dials on it and they say, you can choose
your spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can choose whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I increased the reds and the blues and
everything in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I think this is a case where the
lighting technology the physical products
[SPEAKER_00]: are getting ahead of the plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing the best lighting spectrum
recipe, some growers may call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would argue and say it's still being
researched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're seeing definitely UV light
is showing an indication, but how much UV
[SPEAKER_00]: light, what spectrums of UV light and for
what duration I would argue, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: is still not well, um, understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, definitely it does have an impact as
well as far red, but what is the correct
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would suggest experimenting and
there is continued to be experiments going
[SPEAKER_00]: on with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's great that you, some,
in some cases you can adjust everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't think we're at that stage yet
where at this many days in, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to turn this dial at this many days and
you're going to flip this other dial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think we're at that level yet,
despite the technology being there and it
[SPEAKER_00]: might make you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can change all these spectrums,
but as far as increasing in what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best spectrum, I would say still be
debated in science really is still looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that to be honest, I've heard about
precision stress as far as triggering the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you already mentioned with lighting
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard about, uh, these baby
falls, but everything from adding more
[SPEAKER_01]: wind to parts of the plant in order to,
uh, stress it out that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard about, uh, depriving it of
nutrients or, or even overfeeding
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in order to stress the plant
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those precision stress techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will that actually trigger more terpenes
and cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any things that people should
avoid any techniques that they should
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's many ways to stress the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at stressing a plant to
produce the compounds we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you also say overwater
the plant, that's going to definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: stress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to stress it to the point that
produces more, you know, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to stress it in ways that
are going to cause it to kind of like go
[SPEAKER_00]: into shut down mode, um, and not stress it
in a quote good way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you're right with wind, uh,
that can be utilized, um, to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stress plants, but probably not increase
those, uh, terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that lighting, the way,
why is that, why is lighting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a main focus there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what it's doing is that UV light,
a lot of the times the parts of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: we want are the ones exposed to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're exposed to that harsh UV
light, they're going to produce those
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary compounds and those secondary
compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They produce in response to that are
typically in those flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, cannabinoids, um, kind of
classification.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at some early plants,
uh, poison ivy is a major one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone always says, um, you know,
three leaves shine, three shiny leaves of
[SPEAKER_00]: green stay away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well, early on when poison ivy first
comes out, it actually is very heavy red
[SPEAKER_00]: tones to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way of those very early
leaves, self protecting themselves from
[SPEAKER_00]: the harsh UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see that with a blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might see that with berries,
for example, or certain fruits that change
[SPEAKER_00]: color or peppers or something you wait for
a different color to turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's kind of that same compounds
in there that are changing coloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times it does come with,
you know, lighting, um, and you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at producing those phyto compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those, if you're making a
very broad stroke, those cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: those terpenes are basically kind of those
phyto, which is light kind of base
[SPEAKER_00]: components there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, as a result, changing the lighting is
really what's going to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other things, as you mentioned there,
well, you know, different pruning methods
[SPEAKER_00]: can also stress the plants, but are those
going to stress the plants in a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce more cannabinoids, more terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, to the greatest degree we would want,
uh, some point city growers, some
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse growers will actually,
to keep their plants shorter, to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants stunted, but not in a
negative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually take what looks like,
I don't know what word this kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: a, if you go to a car wash, you know,
they've got the big, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of the brushes that you kind of
drive through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they actually take fine pieces of
plastic and they go over the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a big giant brush down the whole row,
and they just touch the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tickle the plants, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sense there, because they're in a
controlled environment, not a lot of wind,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it the sense of them being outside and
helps reduce that internode spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a stress to the plant,
but is that sure internode spacing going
[SPEAKER_00]: to produce more terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a little comparison there of
stressing the plant is one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing to produce, uh, terpenes,
cannabinoids, a little specific stress
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you mentioned about keeping the plant
short brings us into our next subject,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people using plant growth
regulators to alter the way the plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are naturally occurring, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what you know
about them and how they impact plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the time is when we're selling
an end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are a lot of times there are
tests for, uh, PGRs, plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators, and pretty much across the
board, not really permitted to be used and
[SPEAKER_00]: often tested for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but there can be a substantial impact
on the plant morphology, meaning how the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant actually looks, which is why they're
kind of being used there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they can help increase density,
um, of plant, and it can be a very night
[SPEAKER_00]: and day difference, um, there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that can really improve the return
on investment, which is a lot why a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growers start to seek, seek them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, as you mentioned,
there are naturally occurring,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's go with regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll broaden that to hormones there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's taking like a regular,
um, you know, high school biology or
[SPEAKER_00]: botany class, uh, auxins, gibberellins,
um, uh, abscisic acid, ethylene,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these should come to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably the one most growers are
utilizing and is often allowed,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in pretty much all production,
again, depending on different regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: but auxin as a, um, rooting compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it does other things, but,
um, it's found in a lot of rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're making clones or cuttings,
um, or air grafting, or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, auxin might be something you might
want to be utilizing, uh, to help increase
[SPEAKER_00]: that root formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gibberellins has kind of helped the plants
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to keep a plant,
you know, more dwarf, tighter internet
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing, well, there's, you know,
you want to kind of like block or reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: the gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to like stretch out like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Abscisic acid is involved a lot in usually
seed dormancy, keeping the seed dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want an apple tree to fall,
an apple fall off the tree and immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: grow into another apple tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's abscisic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're to delay it from germinating
because the offspring don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: directly compete with the mother or stock
plant there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ethylene, most people, not even
growers are probably most familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually the ripening hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get that hard piece of fruit
and you throw it in a paper bag and you
[SPEAKER_00]: wait a couple of days and you pull it out,
it's nice and soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what you've done is you've basically
condensed the ethylene, speeding up that
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, it was a big problem because
ethylene is actually in very small
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product of internal combustion engines,
very small amounts, but they were shipping
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes from the West Coast to the East
Coast and having an issue with them speed
[SPEAKER_00]: ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally the slight exhaust from
the truck causing those tomatoes to ripen
[SPEAKER_00]: much, much quicker than they originally
anticipated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something else to just consider there
when we're talking about these impacts of
[SPEAKER_00]: these plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can they be dangerous?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, why are they testing for these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's often still debated on how
dangerous or which ones are maybe more
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a medical perspective,
it's really best to avoid them,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the synthetic ones whenever
possible, simply because we don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess is the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some indication that there could
be some dangerous ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the European Union as well as the
United States do have some regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: there as far as what might be approved,
what might be approved, which ones they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be scanning for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not approved for certain use in food
products in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus Canada and other regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is some early indications that we
would definitely want to proceed with
[SPEAKER_00]: caution when using PGRs and know where
your end product might be going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is regulated, if it is tested for,
try to find other means for obtaining the
[SPEAKER_00]: same plant morphology without utilizing
those particular compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned ethylene gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring it back to that real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these medicinal varieties that
folks grow, some may have, they might be
[SPEAKER_01]: on a time line and it may not be finished
at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've heard a little trick is to place
that plant next to tomato plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, which are releasing ethylene
gas to help with the ripening process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also hear about don't put your
tomatoes next to your bananas because
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll impact the bananas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll turn them a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it true what I mentioned before about
the putting the tomatoes next to the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal varieties and to help with
ripening?
[SPEAKER_00]: It will help speed up the ripening
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you necessarily get the full profile
of cannabinoids and terpenes when you
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe not necessarily, but you will
improve it in a shorter duration of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another key example, which is flowers in
general, there we had a flower display of
[SPEAKER_00]: cut flowers for sale and it was the only
refrigerator in the area and people would
[SPEAKER_00]: put their lunch in there and they put
their apples and bananas and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely frowned upon because as you
mentioned that ethylene is a gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does speed ripen anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you reduce the temperature and cut
flowers to try to slow down the ripening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you add ethylene, that's going to
cause an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for the medicinal plants, adding a
banana there or spraying with ethylene,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, it could help with the
overall ripening process, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking at timing it with that
plant to also produce those compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because you're speeding up that
peach or that nectarine in the paper bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really didn't change anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of started to break down a
little bit quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendation for those that want
to speed up that process and still return
[SPEAKER_00]: an investment to be relatively high,
if they are not adding it, I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend keeping your light par very high
and then also adding carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: enrichment there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That definitely will help speed along that
process with still kind of getting all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the goodies that the plant will naturally
produce without just kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: producing an artificially quick end
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to humic and fulvic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think these are very underrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know chelation comes to mind when you
talk about humic and fulvic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about humic and fulvic
acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically humic fulvic, I'm kind of
going to talk about them kind of one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are slightly different, but they
basically, they're a breakdown of
[SPEAKER_00]: prehistoric deposits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've ever used a true humic or
fulvic acid, I know some come in liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: form, but the powdered form is kind of
like a coal, a very, very fine coal,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you haven't used it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of sedimentation layers,
and they are ground to a very fine
[SPEAKER_00]: granular type fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is basically really old organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, you know, true coal,
but kind of gives you that same coal-like
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency and kind of look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in my channel, I've got a little
bit of a research article looking at some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the production of utilizing some of
that because they are typically used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of in combination with other things
with nutrient treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humic acids can enhance phosphorus
fertilization or actually enhance just
[SPEAKER_00]: regular NPK, your nitrogen, phosphorus,
and potassium fertilizers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can, you know, also potentially have
a negative impact on some cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where you've kind of got to
look at and balance certain things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help make nutrients more
available, which of course is a great
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but there can be, they can shift
metabolisms in plants and potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: cause kind of an impact on these
cannabinoids that we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while phosphorus can be, you know,
enhanced treatment, it may not have effect
[SPEAKER_00]: on the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't think that just necessarily,
oh, more nutrients to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, more of everything, not necessarily
the case there.
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK supplementation may have an increased
in the flowers, but can, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: impact other things, can impact,
you know, some of your other cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where I say, you know,
scientific studies are what's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I try to do, again, in my channel
is try to take some of these complex
[SPEAKER_00]: studies because I know they're not
everyone's great bedtime read and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: break them down to the simplicities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you may not understand all the
specific plant signaling interactions in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but just what are some of the
bigger pictures?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think it really makes some
people think about is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some practices that they just hear people
do and just assume they're making,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, potentially incorrect
connections, as I said, with that great
[SPEAKER_00]: more nutrients plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's going to be exactly what
the plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use less fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything in moderation on there,
because you can also have an impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not be, you know, what you
necessarily may have thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can get a reduction in some
of those final end products there because
[SPEAKER_00]: quote, you're not stressing the plant out,
you know, to go back to our previous
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation where if you make it too easy
for the plant, well, the plant's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow just fine, you know, and perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to think, I don't need to
produce those secondary compounds because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a perfect environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those levels of stress, you know,
are key there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't mind using humic and
folic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are used a lot in fertilizers and
great for, you know, high stress nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: applications, but just watch the amount
that you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: More is not necessarily better,
even though they'll often say you can add
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, humic acid isn't going to
completely, you know, growing in a pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: two or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is just something worth
consideration that yes, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate a lot of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You come with it incorporated,
but just watch the amount that you add
[SPEAKER_00]: because more is not necessarily better.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have several videos on flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your overall stance on it and
what's the best way to go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the most important part with
flushing in general, and if you type,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, properly how to properly flush
on my channel, I found a great thesis
[SPEAKER_00]: related to irrigation events and doctoral
dissertation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it goes through and it
really provides a great kind of breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: here of some options that they chose and
why you would flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I guess flushing in general,
you know, kind of what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically done at the end of a
flowering cycle to kind of flush away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it gets its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root zone of a nutrients, because if
you overpack the root zone with nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and salts that can have a negative impact
on, you know, flavors and aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can reduce those, you know,
aromatic compounds by salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of growers will tell me,
well, you know, I'd stay away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look, make sure there's not a lot of
salt in, you know, in the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from a plant standpoint,
a botanical standpoint, a chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, every nutrient is basically a
salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how they're plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're not fertilizing with pure
iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't take, you know, an iron nail and
go through and file it down and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, add iron filings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really not going to be plant
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a lot of these compounds,
you know, not just straight nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: that's in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all breathing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do they need nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it needs to be in, you know,
our nitrates, our ammonia, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that are plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those fall into classification of
salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because it's not sodium chloride
doesn't mean necessarily that it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they went through and they had
controlled treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did mild stress, they did moderate
stress, and they just started to look at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, dry matter, you know,
what, just a nice comparison there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in any graph you're looking at,
be mindful that you might see letters
[SPEAKER_00]: above these different bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the statisticians that,
you know, they can get into the details,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the lay person, just understand
that if the letter is the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if one bar is higher than the other
bar, if the letters are the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're basically the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: The variability means that they're
basically the same thing or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically the same, I guess I should
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see all these bars of high and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at all these differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the p-value, the letters are the
same, then it's basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the, you know, what the general
kind of summary really is that there
[SPEAKER_00]: really is not any one method of flushing a
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not just that one way that this is
how you flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing it this way,
then you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of what, why, like why all this
variability?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hear about everyone doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it also comes down to what media
you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing in a soilless media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing in a rock wall media?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing in an aeroponic media
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's really where a lot of
this variability does come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How old are your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are you fertilizing with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you fertilizing more organic
fertilizers with, or more chemically
[SPEAKER_00]: based?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the organic growers, organic-based
nutrients, you might have to flush for
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those organic nutrients take longer to
break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those chemical-based nutrients,
which chemical is not bad, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people think chemical bad, organic good,
not necessarily always the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those chemical fertilizers, they're going
to flush much closer to their harvest time
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to be able to rid of
those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's really studied the exact,
like, you know, chemistry behind all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different flushings based on all the
medias, or to get into some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details, the CEC or cation exchange
capacity that plays into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember just that goal is to reduce those
nutrients in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of want that plant as a stress to
pull any last availability, break down
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients, produce those high
aromas, produce those high aromatic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, and avoid some of the salt
contamination which can cause that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another variable to the aspect,
you know, to make people think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never going to flush again because
there's just too much variables,
[SPEAKER_00]: but consider the water you're flushing
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consider the pH, the EC, or parts per
million of that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the purer and more pH neutral,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you have a well water that has
a lot of just natural calcium or magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: deposits in there, a lot of lime in that
water, you think you're flushing,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I'm flushing with just pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just because you didn't add
nutrients, is it really pure water?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to consider that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're flushing, am I flushing
too early, too much, too little?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that if you're starting to see
yellowing of the lower portion of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, nitrogen typically is that first
nutrient that's flushed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your lower leaves are starting to
turn yellow when you're flushing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably just flushing just a
little bit too much because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing that nitrogen, you're flushing
that out, and that'll be the first
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of like a grower's warning
sign that, hey, my lower leaves are
[SPEAKER_00]: turning a little lighter green,
a little yellowish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a sign you're a little
aggressive on your flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And timing is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why keeping notes,
keeping logs, very important in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: of depends what media you're growing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing a soil base,
if you're an outdoor grower, you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing for a lot longer than someone
who's hydroponic to kind of give you both
[SPEAKER_00]: ends or extremes of the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lose that nutrient, the plant's
going to be devoid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very quick turnaround time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, high buffering capacity,
going to take a lot longer to kind of go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and flush those nutrients free
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what comes down to
knowing your substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using clay pebbles, also very short
duration of time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So key part is for any grower looking at
trying this, if they hopefully haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: scared them away, you take a reading of
the water going in, take a parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million or an EC or TDS, whatever unit
you're using, and then you flush that till
[SPEAKER_00]: the water comes out of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you capture that water and you test
that water and you see what nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are at initially and then what
they're at after five minutes of flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you reduce that part per million?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you reduce that EC levels down?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good sign that you are removing
those nutrients from that root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's again, goes to your indoor and
outdoor people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just you're going to have to flush for a
different duration and also based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: substrate that you are utilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't flush, I know there's a
lot of folks that don't flush,
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't believe in flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feed all the way up until the end,
or they will just simply stop feeding like
[SPEAKER_01]: a week before, two weeks before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call that leaching as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you feed up all the way till the
end, this is an annual plant, at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants that most of the people
are growing that are listening to this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be a natural
senescence that happens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the leaves are going to fade no matter
if you feed all the way up until the end
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it could be genetic variability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will stay green for longer than
others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually if you push that plant long
enough, it's going to senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves will fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are green all the way to the
end, you're probably over fertilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a side note, I can usually tell a corn
field, of course you can always tell in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're driving down in the area,
see a corn field, and right before they
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest, if that plant is entirely green,
they over fertilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bottom leaves, as you're saying,
should be starting to senesce,
[SPEAKER_00]: should be starting to yellow, should be
starting to lose their vibrance of green
[SPEAKER_00]: because most growers I know aren't selling
the leaves, they're selling the other
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you want those nutrients
to ultimately go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little senescence at the end is a
sign with the nutrients just right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you harvest the plant,
next up is the drying process,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I want to get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of the best
practices for the drying process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, it's really after you
harvest, you're kind of looking at those
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions you're putting
that final product in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, 60% humidity, 60 degrees
Fahrenheit, that's kind of like the target
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity to go for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other factors to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air circulation is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining good air circulation in any
dry cure room is definitely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixing the air vertically as well as
horizontally, and that doesn't mean a fan
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing right on all the leaves for 100%
of the time, just moving that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be mindful of the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you walk in there, a little breeze is
okay to feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like speed drying, but just movement
of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really important through the
whole process, but especially early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants are going to wick a lot of
moisture early on, you want to be mindful
[SPEAKER_00]: of ensuring that you have control over
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're getting that moisture in
there, that's also potentially going to
[SPEAKER_00]: impact your temperature or your means of
controlling temperature, I guess I should
[SPEAKER_00]: say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general range is 60 to 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely don't want to be going much
over 70, as we said, those terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to break them down in the
drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some groceries lowest 58 to 62 Fahrenheit
being ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say to make it easy,
60 to 60, 60% humidity, 60 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, good target.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're plus or minus a couple of
degrees, don't actually freak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That general range is a key for
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That humidity, some growers target a
little lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That 55 to 65 is again, that general range
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to maintain that
particularly early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants are going to be wicking a lot
of that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In humidity, that is humidity that we're
talking here about that end process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're early on on the clone or
seedling, you know, you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity levels 80, 90, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a moisture content or
humidity level you want to maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire growth cycle of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're specifically talking that end part
because growers are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only concerned about the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that 60 to 60% is my target,
I want that plant to be a peak performance
[SPEAKER_00]: of 60% the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to reduce that humidity ideally as
the plant grows because there are
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages to having some moisture in the
air earlier in the plant cycle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lighting is another important
consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be dried in a dark environment,
but this doesn't mean like absolutely no
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, yes, no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have to go into the room or do
something, you don't need like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: candlelight to be kind of like going
through the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn a light on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not recommend any of your grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want super bright
lights, but your regular, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: shop lights are perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to stumble through the dark
to go get whatever you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try to keep it as minimal as possible
in intensity and as minimal as possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: duration as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all these conditions that I've
talked about here, you know, the even air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, the 60 degrees Fahrenheit
temperature, the moisture content around
[SPEAKER_00]: 60%, the minimum light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep those consistent through
the entire dry process and cure process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at one or two weeks for
this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times a growers environmental
control systems will struggle early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, they first cut everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They throw it all in the room and they
can't control humidity because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just so much initial moisture released.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely want to be making sure
that you're oversizing your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're checking your equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dehumidifier, you are empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're checking that because usually when
they fill up with water, they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically shut down through an air
that's really dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be adding humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the fun part of seeing growers
be experts in one area and then hired by a
[SPEAKER_00]: firm somewhere else in a different
geographic area and really struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sadly, that was the case from some growers
that came from a very dry environment to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Northeast in particular, where there's
a lot of humidity in the Northeast and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's not a lot in kind of the Rocky
Mountain region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those growers that were experts where
they were growing them, that's why they
[SPEAKER_00]: were hired, really looked like newbies
because of the change or shift in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing, do you need a dehumidifier or
do you need a humidifier?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain that 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the focus of that dry and
cure temperature and humidity to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether you need to add or subtract,
that's based on your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do you maintain this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as we talked about earlier,
we're trying to maintain all that work we
[SPEAKER_00]: did for those cannabinoids and those
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really trying to maintain those at
the highest level within the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dry them improperly and cure them
improperly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're further breaking down those
components that you put all that effort
[SPEAKER_00]: into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're adding high heat,
well, you're destroying them there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're trying to just maximize every
portion of the process, starting with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to maximize the production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you cut that off the plant,
there's your 100% you can only go down
[SPEAKER_00]: from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your goal as a professional grower
drying and curing is really to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of percentage that you might be
losing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as always, you should be sending
a sample out to get tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have something to show potential
consumers there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really a great way to kind of,
you know, prove what's in what the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: actually took up and good for the grower
to know, Hey, what, what is, what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, what, you know, what is this
kind of producing as far as terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: To know good for potential consumers to
know as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, after the drying process comes
curing, can you talk to us about some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best practices there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you know, there's no,
again, no one, you know, kind of proper
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the environmental controls,
that kind of end process will be very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people grow for that,
you know, 62% humidity is kind of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers growing in some form of,
I'll call it a sealed container type for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that final curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you hear container, a lot of
growers are thinking, well, I want to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a big five gallon pail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger is not always better in this case
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on, you know, if you're large
scale, sure, five gallon containers would
[SPEAKER_00]: be fine, but really those smaller,
more controlled environments might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chosen container, you know,
just as, you know, the gold standard
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at usually wide mouthed mason
jars, usually about 32 ounce jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the standard because you're
not packing the jar, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave about 25, about a
quarter percent airspace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that breathing process to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to like pack everything in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always stress the wide mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with the smaller,
but just easier to kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you put your hand in there,
that wide mouth does just make it so much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why you leave that airspace
is you can kind of like move things
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean you kind of go up to it
and like, like the, I always say like the
[SPEAKER_00]: power ball where you're kind of like
shaking everything up and bouncing
[SPEAKER_00]: everything around like crazy, but just,
you know, once the end process develops,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, flat spots, you kind of want to
keep that area appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get two things close
together because what that's going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is trap potential humidity in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just move them around a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that curing process I mentioned
before, dark place is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what a lot of growers take this to
mean is that I need a light block
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an option for that,
all the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by simply putting them in a dark room
with minimal amount of lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: that accomplishes the exact same thing and
still allows you to go through and inspect
[SPEAKER_00]: the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that inspection is important,
you don't want to set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, it was 62%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sealed them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in the room and see in two
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do want to kind of just be checking
that, make sure that the room is
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining the conditions, make sure
there is no mold developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure there is kind of nothing is
quote changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of checking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have that kind of routine just to
check on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of growers do an interesting
process, particularly early on we'll call
[SPEAKER_00]: it what's called burping the containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like opening the lid,
cracking the lid, just kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: just allow any buildup of anything to kind
of be released there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow some moisture potentially to escape,
allow oxygen to kind of replenish in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any follow orders that you're noticing
during this stage is a sign mold might be
[SPEAKER_00]: developing even if you don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to put those in a separate
location there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this burping will be done more
frequently early on as those plants kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of settle in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be done less and less and less
frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maintain that humidity, a lot of people
are throwing humidity control packs in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that target 60 to 65% is really
that target.
[SPEAKER_00]: That first week, some people might burp
twice daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeks two to three and beyond,
you're kind of cutting down to once a week
[SPEAKER_00]: or every other day, every third day to
once a week, kind of so on and so forth
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to tell based on the
aromas.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of curing, two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really don't go much beyond eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're still curing after eight weeks,
you're doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that step, you're kind of at the
final storage, if you will, of that end
[SPEAKER_00]: product there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very detailed answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of your answers here were
very detailed and straight to the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned at the beginning of
the episode, that's what I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people like about your style of teaching
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distinct and to the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can say it in three words,
say it in three, don't give me 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say Debaco University on
YouTube would be a great way to review
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have different, you know,
playlists there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will say that I also teach a forensic
science course.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching some of my videos and
all of a sudden five stages of body decay
[SPEAKER_00]: come up, which is I don't know why it gets
frequently recommended.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of my videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's of interest to you, watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people wonder, like, how do we go from
plants to this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also on the channel there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage if you like it, you know,
try to you can send comments in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to respond to every comment that I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over a thousand videos on the
channel, so I'm sure you'll find something
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Encourage others to subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been very fortunate with a great
community here sharing out the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know a new grower struggling,
tell them about the channel, reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, help them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to touch on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: From basics of growing to some more
advanced level items.
[SPEAKER_00]: So new growers, old growers, everyone can
hopefully learn something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more kind of videos
planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been updating recently because I do
teach at the University of Connecticut
[SPEAKER_00]: running a course, two courses there,
New York Botanical Gardens, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida Gulf Coast University.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about different
environments, growing different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are one gets snow and one's
concerned that there's a crocodile that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to eat the, you know, the birds
outside their bird feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great little contrast there on
the eastern seaboard there of the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other ways you can more professionally,
you know, potentially take one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: courses going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, hopefully enjoy what you find
on the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, subscribe, at least subscribe and be
sure to tell others about the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much appreciated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely have a link to Matt's
channel down in the description section
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're listening on one of the
podcast platforms, just search for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find them on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button, trying to get as many
[SPEAKER_01]: thumbs up as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps with the YouTube algorithm in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend, I'm releasing a new
garden talk podcast episode, and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: love for you to tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, this has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been very insightful for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely dipped our toes into some of
the science behind the plant, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always, I'm always learning when it
comes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know my audience is right there
learning with me and you've shared quite a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of value for me and for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you and great to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad I can share some talks plant science
with some interested people.
