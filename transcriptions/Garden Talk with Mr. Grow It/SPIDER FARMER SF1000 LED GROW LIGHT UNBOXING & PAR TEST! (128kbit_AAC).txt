[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the Spider Farmer SF-1000 LED
grow light in this video on their unboxing
[SPEAKER_00]: unit and also test the power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know about the specific
features of this grow light or
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications I will provide a link to it
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I open the box and pull out the
contents first up is a Spider Farmer VIP
[SPEAKER_00]: card.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've included some plant tags,
a thank you card, I have a pretty nice
[SPEAKER_00]: user manual, and now my cat Stella is
going to join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's excited to see what else is in the
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: After moving the top you can see the LED
grow light which does have the driver and
[SPEAKER_00]: power cord attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've included wire hangers and two
ratchet hangers in this bag and then
[SPEAKER_00]: lastly they've also included measuring
tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: so if there's any light being emitted from
the grow light that's outside of this
[SPEAKER_00]: range it won't show on this PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurements are shown in PPFD and this is
just going to give you a general idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am taking measurements in a grow tent
which does have reflective walls that
[SPEAKER_00]: could increase these PAR numbers so just
keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light has a flowering
coverage area of two foot by two foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements in a two
foot by four foot grow tent so I'll keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the light to the side of the tent and keep
the meter within a two foot by two foot
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances 12 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches away, and 24 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I have provided a link to this grow
light in the description section below and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
