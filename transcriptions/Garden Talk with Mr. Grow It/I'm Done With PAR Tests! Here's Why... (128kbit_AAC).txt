[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and I'm back with another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an announcement video for you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good things come to an end,
and today I want to announce the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: part tests on this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely been a long journey,
but I think it is for the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'll explain why I got into
part tests to begin with, why I'm stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and also I'm going to refer you to
some other channels that do part tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, why did I get into part
tests to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well for me, I know when I'm looking for
grow light, one of the things I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at is PAR output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much PAR that grow light is
emitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can look on grow light listings.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them do include a PAR chart,
which it shows kind of the footprint
[SPEAKER_00]: overview, and then it shows different PPFD
numbers across that footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the problems that I found with
that is that some companies only list one
[SPEAKER_00]: light distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you move that light to other light
distances, you're kind of guessing to what
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I found that some companies inflate
their numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're actually showing on that
PAR chart is inflated, it's higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: what actually the PAR meter that I'm using
is showing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also found that some grow light
companies only list the middle dead center
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really know what that light
spread is across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So decided to start doing part test videos
where, I mean most of you have seen them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically take a PAR meter and run it
across the grow space and show you what
[SPEAKER_00]: the different PPFD measurements are across
that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that provides value because those who
have that grow light get a better idea of
[SPEAKER_00]: what the grow light distance should be at
the different stages of growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's honestly been pretty fun doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get my hands on a bunch of
different grow lights, got to talk with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different companies and build
relationships there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the past year, I've done 41 PAR
tests on this channel alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did one PAR test on my main
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 42 total PAR tests, which is kind of
crazy looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the reason why I got into them
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people out there
that want to see this information and this
[SPEAKER_00]: information wasn't out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to stop because it really,
it's very time consuming to do these PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from talking with the brands,
having them send it over to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: unboxing it, filming it, editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time I actually didn't get
paid anything for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would let me keep the grow light and
I would have to, you know, the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: really to earn money was to resell the
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a few times where I did get a
small amount of money for doing the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, but it was very, very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I maybe got paid maybe two or
three times out of those 42 videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, the money isn't something that I
really cared about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I care about more is my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that doing these PAR tests really
took up a lot of time and I didn't put out
[SPEAKER_00]: nearly as many videos on growing plants as
I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was prioritizing PAR tests, filming,
editing those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it would come time to film my
plants and edit videos for my main
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't have that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now since I'm not doing them anymore,
I will be able to spend more time filming
[SPEAKER_00]: and editing videos on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several people who do PAR
tests on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So since I don't do them anymore,
I'm going to refer you to three people who
[SPEAKER_00]: do do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second channel that I want to refer
you to is Migro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane over at Migro, he owns Migro
Lighting and he does PAR tests on his
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just for his lights, but he does do
them for several lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: His entire channel is Grow Light
Information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's definitely very knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes in depth about the PAR tests and
he gives you an honest opinion on the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of you may say, oh, he owns a
lighting company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's biased towards his own lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch his videos and you'll see that
that's really not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last channel I want to refer you to that
does PAR tests is Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just started doing PAR tests this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he probably has like, let's see,
two, four, seven different PAR tests on
[SPEAKER_00]: his channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about all the features in the
video, shows you the PAR test results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he also has a Grow Light
Calculator, which he can calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You enter in the power draw, the cost of
light, the PPF of the light, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to output what the photon efficiency
is, what the cost efficiency is,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what the harvest potential is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of good information that he is
showing to his audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, this is going to give you more
information in order to make a smarter
[SPEAKER_00]: buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many grow lights on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so easy to get caught up and not
know what's good versus bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some companies out there that
are selling lights that are three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, five years old that are nowhere near
as efficient as the grow lights that came
[SPEAKER_00]: out this year and last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to stay up to date on LED
grow lights, subscribe to these three
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to their channels down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going to be on this channel
then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to continue with the topic
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do more one-on-one discussion
videos with other growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also anything else that might not fit
on my main YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's pretty much all I wanted
to cover in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
