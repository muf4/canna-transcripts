[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the HLG100V2 LED grill light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 3000K color temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit has LM301B diodes and I'm going
to be doing a PAR test today.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this test I'm going to use the Apogee
MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures a certain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures from 389 nanometers to 692
nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurements are in PPFD and this is just
going to give you a general idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAR output is for this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not meant to be a 100% accurate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a grow tent so the reflective
walls could throw things off a bit and I
[SPEAKER_00]: have the grow tent open so one side isn't
even getting the reflective walls but
[SPEAKER_00]: again this is just to give you guys a
general idea of what the PAR measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow light has a flowering coverage
area of 2 foot by 2 foot and this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent is a 2 foot by 4 foot so I'm going to
keep the PAR meter on one side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do three different distances
12 inches away 18 inches away and then 24
[SPEAKER_00]: inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other PAR videos I will
let the measurements do the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have four potentially five more
PAR test videos coming at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be released in the upcoming
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, peace.
