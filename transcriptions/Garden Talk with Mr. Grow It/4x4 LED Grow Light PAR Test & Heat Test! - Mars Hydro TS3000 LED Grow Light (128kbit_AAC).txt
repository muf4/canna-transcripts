[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro sent me over their TS-3000 LED
grille light and in this video I am going
[SPEAKER_00]: to test the PAR output and I'm also going
to do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually already did a PAR test and heat
test and actually unboxed this unit in a
[SPEAKER_00]: previous video, however in that video I
adjusted the dimmer to go up to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro doesn't recommend adjusting the
dimmer to 100% because it decreases the
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had some requests in the comments
section for me to do a PAR test at factory
[SPEAKER_00]: settings which is 450 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm going to do in this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see the other PAR test on
this grow light I'll link it down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also provide a link to this grow
light in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Rage PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time watching my PAR
test videos I do them just to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could increase the numbers so just
keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering coverage area for this grow
light is 4 feet by 4 feet and I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in a 4 foot by 4 foot grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged this LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 3.78 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 449 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below along with that other PAR
test I did where I adjusted the dimmer to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
