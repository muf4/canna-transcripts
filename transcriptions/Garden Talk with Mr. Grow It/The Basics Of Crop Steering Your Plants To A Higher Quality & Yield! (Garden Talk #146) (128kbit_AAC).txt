[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 146.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Chris from
Crop Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for five years and
is big into crop steering, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get into in today's
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about the basics of crop
steering, everything from what crop
[SPEAKER_00]: steering is, types of crop steering,
climate, lighting, irrigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much more.

[SPEAKER_00]: We're back and I'm joined with Chris from
Crop Culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk all about crop
steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually reached out to me several
months ago and wanted to be on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk shop, and I like talking shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave me some suggestions for things
that we could get into and lots of good
[SPEAKER_00]: topics to choose from, but I really
narrowed it down to that crop steering one
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think that's becoming more and
more popular these days amongst folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get more and more questions about it and
figured we would dive into that one this
[SPEAKER_00]: time around and talk about your experience
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that I got into gardening was
actually through growing, and I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that my story and why I started
growing is very relatable, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: to most growers that are coming into the
scene nowadays and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and they are having really
poor experience after poor experience and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're overpaying for product that is
overdried and it's rushed to the shelves
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's stale and it's flavorless and it
has no effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're spending hundreds, thousands of
dollars and at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you say enough is enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, Illinois went legal back in
2020 and that was when I decided to jump
[SPEAKER_01]: on board with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did like most people and I went and
Googled best place to buy seeds and best
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment and all those things and was
ushered into the corrals that are in place
[SPEAKER_01]: with SEO to make sure that you're landing
on white labeled seed banks and the big
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that are paying the top dollar for
SEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, like many, went and bought all of those
recommendations and had really poor
[SPEAKER_01]: results actually, surprise, surprise,
with the first couple of runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really enjoyed the growing aspect of
it, the nurturing for something living.
[SPEAKER_01]: It inspired a curiosity in me to want to
get better at this and that's just in my
[SPEAKER_01]: nature to, when I pick up a hobby,
I want to be the best at it or the best
[SPEAKER_01]: that I can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through exhaustive lengths to get
more knowledgeable on this plant and start
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand it at a biological level and
it ultimately led me to living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, Bill the Soil and Jeremy
Silva, I really gravitated towards his
[SPEAKER_01]: message and it really aligned with who I
am as a person and I started digging
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper and deeper into living soil and
that's what led me to gardening because
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening in my mind is a much more,
it's a much broader term and to me there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a spiritual element to it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started growing all sorts of things
outside and my wife and I collect
[SPEAKER_01]: houseplants and we amassed this huge
collection of houseplants that we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: dwindle down to just the rare and exotic
ones because everybody can go get a snake
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or money trees and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gardening has stemmed from growing
medicinal plants indoors and I've taken
[SPEAKER_01]: the grows outdoors and it is deep in my
connection with nature, my appreciation
[SPEAKER_01]: for the balance that exists in nature and
it's really just been a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was really just a constant
dissatisfaction with the dispensary market
[SPEAKER_01]: that led me to growing my own medicinal
herbs which led to gardening many other
[SPEAKER_01]: things, fruits and vegetables and flowers,
things that bring me a lot of joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome and I know you've gone so
far to do a couple different things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that's notable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Growers Hangout.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a part of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can talk about that for a minute
and then also the Crop Culture box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you talk to us about those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started a podcast weekly every
Tuesday with my friend Aaron, Support Dope
[SPEAKER_01]: People and Pete of Heisentert Brothers and
it is a community-based platform where we
[SPEAKER_01]: try to provide value to our viewers and
we're trying to bring guests and experts
[SPEAKER_01]: on that are bringing a unique perspective
and it really does cater to newer growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and not to say that experienced growers
can't find benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had people like Miles from Weed
Should Taste Good speaking about living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and fermented plant extracts and
we've had Eric from Thrive Yahweh who came
[SPEAKER_01]: on and talked about the value of
Lactobacillus and his products and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: just an amazing deep dive into the science
of it and it's been a really fun thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, to be able to share the things that I
do in my garden, the things that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: experienced a positive benefit from with
people to see if that's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: they would like to adopt and do it
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it relates to the Crop Culture box,
so Crop Culture again was stemming from
[SPEAKER_01]: that whole dispensary thing and when I
started growing as a collector myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop Culture being a very important part
of my life, being a child of the 80s and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up through, I don't even think
it's arguably the most profound time in
[SPEAKER_01]: American history when it came to pop
culture and I incorporate a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: things into the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Crop Culture is, is a premium,
thoughtfully curated growers box that
[SPEAKER_01]: releases quarterly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're theme boxes where I partner with
the best breeders in the industry and the
[SPEAKER_01]: best brands in the industry and I do the
research to make sure that these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: best products and these are things that
get my stamp of approval and I am able to
[SPEAKER_01]: leverage wholesale pricing with my
partners and I pass those savings along to
[SPEAKER_01]: my customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These boxes are truly an unbeatable value
and the reason why I'm able to do this is
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have a really good day job that
I'm very fortunate for that it pays the
[SPEAKER_01]: bills and it affords me the opportunity to
kind of do this as a creative venture and
[SPEAKER_01]: give back to the community which I feel
has given so much to me and not being a
[SPEAKER_01]: very financially driven person,
I would rather pack more value into the
[SPEAKER_01]: box because at the end of the day,
I want something that I would be excited
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a very discerning taste and I want
every single person to open their box and
[SPEAKER_01]: be blown away by what they received and
you always are going to get much more than
[SPEAKER_01]: what I ever advertise, I always under
promise and over deliver and I work with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of up and coming breeders as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not be the featured breeder for
the box because I have to leverage
[SPEAKER_01]: recognition and things like that but they
send me packs and it's a platform to help
[SPEAKER_01]: them grow as well and share their genetics
with people and get them engaging with
[SPEAKER_01]: these breeders and helping them grow so
it's really been a beautiful way to
[SPEAKER_01]: harmoniously bring together breeders and
brands and it's not a competitive thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is just this everybody can benefit from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get on the topic before
people start complaining in the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crop steering, break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of beginners tune into my show as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is crop steering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so crop steering in a nutshell is
taking the way that we refer to it is
[SPEAKER_01]: taking your indoor garden and altering the
variables of your lighting, your climate
[SPEAKER_01]: and your irrigation to steer the outcome
of your plants and your phyrochemical
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles in your plants so your
cannabinoids, flavonoids, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: we are trying to influence yield and
flavor and potency essentially with crop
[SPEAKER_01]: steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a couple different types.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vegetative steering and then
generative steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, what is vegetative steering?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is meant by that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetative steering and the difference
between that and generative steering is
[SPEAKER_01]: generative steering is triggering the
light cycle for photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where you are in an indoor
environment, switching your light cycle to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 hours on, 12 hours off to trigger that
flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are things that you can also do with
that light cycle in terms of the light
[SPEAKER_01]: duration and intensity to also influence
the outcome of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in vegetative steering, this is where
we are going to be adjusting inputs like
[SPEAKER_01]: our humidity and our lighting and as well
as our irrigation to influence how our
[SPEAKER_01]: plant grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: How vigorously it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways to slow down growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're like me and are really bad at
planning your grows and sometimes run into
[SPEAKER_01]: a situation where you have small plants
that you don't have anywhere to put and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to wait for your tents to open
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways that you could safely and
do it with minimal impact to your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the growth of your plants and have
it pick right back up as soon as you get
[SPEAKER_01]: it transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is basically what we're going to
be talking about today are some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences that I've had adjusting those
various inputs to have dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: different results in many of the plants
that I've grown out over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned having a slow down plant
growth and it's a kind of laugh a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit because I actually released a whole
video on how to titled how to slow down
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth and I definitely raised some
eyebrows for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing was I was going on vacation,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to come back and have
the plants grown into the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, there are things that
sometimes you do need to slow down plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, but that's definitely a separate
topic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good definitions on both of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into to start what we'll break
down each individual thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about climate and then light
intensity and irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that come to
mind is the temperature, day temps versus
[SPEAKER_00]: night temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you kind of break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are you typically aiming for for
day temps?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you aiming for for night temps?
[SPEAKER_00]: What impact the difference has on plant
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this might be a little controversial,
but I kind of like high, high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I am in veg, one of my plants are,
I would say three weeks old all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: through up until week six of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am completely fine with my tents,
tents reaching 90 degrees, 92 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as you have adequate humidity for
the, for the phase of growth that your
[SPEAKER_01]: plan is in adequate air exchange and
airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have, I have a four by two living
soil bed in a four by two tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I often have troubles keeping the,
the temperatures down in that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had issues with, with heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a healthy amount of stress I
think is acceptable and actually needed in
[SPEAKER_01]: every plant's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think to bring out the best expressions,
because let's face it, we're, we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to, this is biomimicry when we're talking
about growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look outdoors in the, in the,
in the summertime, you go outside to,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're growing an outdoor plant and it
is 95 degrees outside, your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: praying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your humidity, you know, the humidity
might be 40, 40% out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we, we try, we try to attain
these, these perfect temperatures and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And VPD is obviously something a lot of
people pay a lot of attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pay attention to it, but I have a,
a very go with the flow type of approach
[SPEAKER_01]: where I just go into my, my garage and I
react to how my plants look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are, there are things that,
so, so when we talk about high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures later in flower, I want to be
very, very careful because like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have newer growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have, adequate air flow and
air exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to have higher temp,
higher humidity levels, I am fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's 90, 90 degrees and 70% humidity
week six flower, my plants are loving it
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want to, you just have to keep
in, keep in mind, you have to keep that
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio, ratio appropriate and making sure
that if you're, if you have leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: overlapping each other, you're not getting
moisture pockets and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are things that you just have to
be aware of, but you know, higher
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, you're going to get,
you're, you're, you're going to get higher
[SPEAKER_01]: yields and your plants are going to grow
more vigorously, especially in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have nice high temperatures,
nice high humidities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are going to grow very
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I tell people all the time
when they ask me questions, I say it
[SPEAKER_01]: really depends because there is no one
size fits all solution to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, or when it comes to advice,
because everybody has different growing
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters and different mediums and
inputs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I try to speak in generalities and,
and add caveats as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to do the same thing because you
know, over the years, people have
[SPEAKER_00]: complained because, uh, you know,
like, Oh, that's not the right
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do this temperature instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, yeah, you can, you can do
90 degrees Fahrenheit like Chris is doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could go down and do 75 degrees,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you're still going to get to
harvest, but yeah, I'm looking at the VPG
[SPEAKER_00]: chart right now, 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flower calls for 64 to 68% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty high, higher than a lot of
people would go in the flower stage
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't want to do that
humidity, but don't want to risk mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you could totally get away with
it, especially if you have that airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm usually running about 82 degrees
Fahrenheit, and then I try to drop it
[SPEAKER_00]: after week five, six of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to drop it down a little bit to
try to conserve some of those terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I have a really perfect
example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to work on, uh, our weakest
variable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grow in a garage and I'm at the mercy
of the outside temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes the hard, the things that
we can't control are, are, are the hardest
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's, it's not always about the,
your environment inside your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of times what you're seeing
outside is that's driving those inside
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to be very, very clear to have
90 degree temperatures in week six of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and as you drop your temperatures,
there are other things that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpene preservation is incredibly
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're going to see, uh, your
anthocyanin is going, if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's present in the genetics,
uh, your plants are going to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, burgundy and purples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you're going to get that beautiful
fall fade with the cooler temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, I actually grew out a clone,
two clones of lumpy's apple fritter,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lumpy's cut of apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I wanted to do, I do a lot of
side-by-side testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is a tremendous amount of
value in doing AB testing for a home
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, um, because it's low risk and by
failing, you observe what caused it to
[SPEAKER_01]: fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel you learn from those failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is an important part of the,
the growing process is that failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then also sometimes you have
happy, uh, accidents and, and really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting things happen, uh,
when you least expect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew out this, uh, this apple
fritter, uh, earth boxes for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I grew one under about 600 par,
which is typically the range that I prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: for my flowering plants, 600 to 900,
uh, is kind of, I don't push my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: very hard because I don't supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so at the lower intensities,
I observed, uh, the plant's morphology was
[SPEAKER_01]: very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the flowers were larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, um, they were firm,
but they were not dense and they had a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more trichome coverage versus the ones
that I grew in another tent at around 1100
[SPEAKER_01]: par and, uh, all the same inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but the buds were smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were much more dense, um,
less trichomes and the flavor was
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different, completely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I even grew it out a third time
with even less light in a, in a two by two
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got where I got gassed the first
time I got grape.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the, the next time just wildly
different, all from the same clone,
[SPEAKER_01]: just by altering light intensities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can look at, let's experiment
with UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, there's been studies showing
that there's significant terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: production increase with, uh, with UVB in
small amounts, uh, in the day or using red
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when you're, when you put your plants
to sleep to help ease them into,
[SPEAKER_01]: into sleep, uh, there are all sorts of
really cool things that we could do with,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, light intensity and, and, uh,
and color frequencies and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: to impact, um, our, our end result as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really good example of how different
climates will yield different results,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the two different clones you
had and different environments and two
[SPEAKER_00]: completely different outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great example of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about day length?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's something that people talk
about when it comes to crop steering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a few things when we're talking
about, um, indoor controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I, I do have, uh,
AC infinity lights that have the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the daylight, uh, the sunrise sunset
feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experimented with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone and done any like true
side-by-side comparisons with that by any
[SPEAKER_01]: means, but, um, what I did notice on the
few times that I have kind of stepped my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants down versus, uh, so going from 18,
six to 14 hours on versus going straight
[SPEAKER_01]: to 12, 12, um, I have found a gentler
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make the argument that the plant
doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you flip it to 12, it's going to
adjust and you're just going to have more
[SPEAKER_01]: time where it's going to be able to
produce at, uh, at, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: our generative phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, like I said, I've, I've tried,
I've tried it numerous times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I think there's,
we may never be able to quantify it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the very least you'll save energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we're, when we're talking about
light duration, we have to talk about DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for anybody who is listening that,
um, hasn't, measured their, their light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity, um, not saying you have to go
buy an expensive meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very effective meters,
um, as apps on your phone and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: little attachments you can get on your
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get really, really close to some
of the higher quality, um, light meters
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, but it is super important to,
um, have your baseline to know where your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are and how much light they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you drop your, your lights
from 18 hours to sit, uh, of light to 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours of light, your plants, uh,
think of it as a battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your battery is not going to fully charge
if you keep your light, uh, intensity at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, uh, at the same rate,
um, at that, at that lower duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you have to scale it
appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, definitely start measuring PAR,
uh, PPFD if you, if you are not,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, because I think that is one of the
evolutions of the home grower is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like the next step to, to really,
um, honing in your grow and having full
[SPEAKER_01]: control or better control, I should say
of, of your outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I would say, uh,
those are probably the things that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've, I've personally experimented
with and, and I'm currently doing is just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stepping down the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I don't know if it's something
I can necessarily say definitively like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, this is making a positive or a
negative impact one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned the PAR range that you
typically aim for 600 to 900 PPFD and
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do the same range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good general range,
but like you mentioned, DLI needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: factored into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a DLI calculator up right now and
it is pretty easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you Google it, I'm not sure if folks in
listening in have done this before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is to put in your PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put 900 and then time hours that
would be how long the lights are on for 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 38.88 DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on average, what I've heard a lot of
people aim for about 40, but with the CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: and other things, people are going up to
60.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's coming from Dr. Bruce Buggy is
one who mentioned that is people are going
[SPEAKER_00]: up as high as 60, which is, uh,
which is pretty crazy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CO2 can have a huge impact on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing that we kind of get
skipped over a little bit when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking with climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_00]: About CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are you supplementing CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there certain PPMs that you're aiming
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that factor into crop steering?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that is actually one area that I
haven't, uh, that I haven't gotten into
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have, I've taken into account
the opinions of growers that I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: have supplemented CO2, um, and measured
it, uh, as well as people that I really
[SPEAKER_01]: respect in the industry that, uh,
that supplements CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for my style, of growing it
is, I, I determined it to be an
[SPEAKER_01]: unnecessary expense because like I said,
I am not pushing my, my lights very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm leaving yield on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I definitely know that, but as a home
grower, I'm okay with that because I
[SPEAKER_01]: really am prioritizing the flavor,
um, over, over, uh, the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I like to have both,
you know, love to have it all,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, you know, that that's just kind
of, uh, really depends on what your
[SPEAKER_01]: priorities are as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need to monetize your medicinal
herbs, then, you know, and prioritize
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, then, you know, that's,
uh, your prerogative and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably financially beneficial to
them and probably pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, it's just, it's just not
something that, um, really fits with my
[SPEAKER_01]: growing style yet, but it's not something
I am against testing in the, in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the opportunity presents itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've experimented a little bit with CO2 in
the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those mushroom bags and the canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of controversy about those and
whether or not they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a monitor, so I was able to see it
was elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm no longer using them, you know,
just like you, I'm a small home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I exhale CO2 and that's enough for the,
the home I live in, the plants where I am,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is certainly worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a study out of Utah State
University where they did PPM levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 up to 1400.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they saw a 30% increase in yield due
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely worth it to increase
CO2, supplement CO2 if you are looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield, but not everybody's looking for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not too sure how that if adjusting
the CO2 up and down would affect the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in some way, like if people use that in
crop steering in order to try to control
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess that's something that,
uh, I have to do some more research and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting because,
um, I mean, essentially what you could be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing is, um, you're stressing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, if there's, there's going to be a
stress response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not too dissimilar to the way
other plants are, um, are steered where
[SPEAKER_01]: they will flip the light cycle between,
uh, generative and vegetative and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, use that to actually increase yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't do that obviously with,
with medicinal herbs because they would,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would freak out and re-veg and you
would have all sorts of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, theoretically it's,
it's not too dissimilar to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we already dove into light intensity a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you touched upon sunrise and sunset,
but there is one thing I wanted to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a study from Dr. Bruce Bugby,
again, coming out of Houston University
[SPEAKER_00]: where he tested sunrise, sunset,
that feature of gradually giving the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants light up to full power versus just
blasting the plants full power when the
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they found was that there was
actually faster growth when you just
[SPEAKER_00]: blasting that light to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I had mentioned that,
in videos in the past, the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes in the past, you get people in
the comments are like, okay, so the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: rate is better when you're blasting light
individually versus the sunrise,
[SPEAKER_00]: sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there other triggers within the
plant that is happening during that
[SPEAKER_00]: sunrise, sunset?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a question that isn't
answered yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure I'd throw that out there for
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's one thing that when it comes to
cultivation, we don't know everything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scientists are still uncovering things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some beginners might be listening this
and be like, oh, it seems to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicting information.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, it's loaded with conflicting
information in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the fun part is kind of diving
through and figure out what works and what
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experimentation on your own and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the discussion should still kind of go
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I figure I'd mention that even
though we don't have a clear cut answer
[SPEAKER_00]: on, uh, on that study.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experimentation, man, like don't be afraid
to just, just try something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like what's the worst that can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you might lose a plant, you know,
like, but you might gain invaluable
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge from that, from that failure
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you, when you could see
something go, go bad, you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can learn a lot from that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, like just the troubleshooting
aspect of it and researching why things
[SPEAKER_01]: are, are starting to, you know,
have a certain reaction one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all very interesting, but experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dive into irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a key thing that is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: While crop steering, like you mentioned in
the beginning of this episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got irrigation volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got frequency and timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll kind of just give you the microphone
here and drop some knowledge on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a grower, um, new or experience
watering is, I think the hardest part to
[SPEAKER_01]: get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's especially important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I will speak to a lot of these
things through the lens of living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is what I have the most
experience with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's, there's also wider
applicability with this as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, um, there are,
there are things that we could do when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to how much we are watering and how
frequently we are watering to drive,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, growth of our plants or
stunted, um, more, more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people suffer from, um,
I think there is a, a common
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstanding of when we're watering,
what is, what is overwatering?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a thorough saturation of your
soil that is causing the overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the thorough saturation and the
constant saturation is the frequency that
[SPEAKER_01]: is becoming the issue and your plants
don't have a way to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, dry backs are incredibly
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why in living soil,
when we, as living soil growers have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can't let things get too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we have to maintain this,
this perfect balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for us, it's very important to
have, uh, some sort of a, a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting some sort of a meter to,
to, to measure your moisture is I think
[SPEAKER_01]: very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whether you're measuring your moisture
at the bottom or the top, uh, doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really matter as much because the way that
I see it, if you're able to learn the
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns of when your water, your plant
needs water and when you, uh, when your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs to dry back, you'll,
you'll be able to, you know, those
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages, you know, the ebb and flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can, I mean, we could talk hours
on, on watering practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the dry back in flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, biomimicry, latent flower,
if you're outdoors growing less,
[SPEAKER_01]: less rain, you go, you're, you're the,
the, the dog days of summer is drought
[SPEAKER_01]: like conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants are, um, they're, they're
going into a preservation mode where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to grow as rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when you are in an indoor
environment, you want to do this,
[SPEAKER_01]: a similar type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be drinking as much
later in flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watering less and less frequently,
um, again, late in the late stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower is what you're going to want
because I think you'll see, if you,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look in a lot of growers gardens
and you see a lot of the leaves that are
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, you, they got the curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking that happened from
overwatering and a lot of times it happens
[SPEAKER_01]: late in flower because you're pumping it
with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to give it all those good
nutrients that you're giving all those,
[SPEAKER_01]: those supplementation with your ferments
and, and, and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to start backing that stuff off
starting in around week, week six or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it all depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a sativa, that's a 22
weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to back off just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if, you know, if you're growing a
hybrid Indica, something that's like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, eight or nine weaker,
I would say week six is around the time
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to start pulling that
stuff back because your plants going to
[SPEAKER_01]: drink less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you, you're, you don't want to
get to a point where you drown your plan
[SPEAKER_01]: and you do stunt your, uh, your flower
growth, uh, because I have, I have found
[SPEAKER_01]: that numerous times I'm, I'm constantly
struggling with finding the, the right
[SPEAKER_01]: balance for watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, because I grow in a bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in a living soil bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have earth boxes and I have auto pots
and they all have nuances to their
[SPEAKER_01]: watering practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, the amount and frequency,
very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I have found very
satisfying of late having a friend that's
[SPEAKER_01]: local that, um, has been a, uh,
that miles from fermented plant extracts
[SPEAKER_01]: was a mentor to he's, uh, he has his own
ferment company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have access to a lot of different
types of ferments and I have tried so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I have found is that there are a
couple in particular that do an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: job of being like an all purpose ferment
because, um, the, the typical,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I guess process with fermentation is
you're trying to encapsulate a moment of
[SPEAKER_01]: time of whatever you're fermenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that, if it's, um,
hemp leaves, for instance, that's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from the vegetative phase of a plant,
you're fermenting that you are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting more of the nutrition and things
that are prevalent in that phase of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of that material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, life cycle when it was
harvested, conversely with flowers or
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are going to have higher,
uh, you know, potentially like geared more
[SPEAKER_01]: towards your flowering phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they may have trade, you know,
smaller amounts of nutrition like
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, although we don't use ferments really
for, for nutrition, it's just kind of an
[SPEAKER_01]: unintended benefit of being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but peach and Willow, um, I've tried,
like comfrey is, is amazing for,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for veg and pumpkin is awesome for
flower, but I find peach has given the
[SPEAKER_01]: most robust flavor in all of the different
varieties that I have tried it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I think Willow is kind of a,
kind of a sleeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think, um, I don't know that I could
speak to why it performs so well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, um, there were, there were visual
differences in my plants health when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: using the Willow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, I, I, I do it when I,
when I compare clones, I run clones so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can do a true AB test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so when I, when I say these things,
it's not me testing these theories on
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple cultivars or even multiple
phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're usually, you know,
they're, they're from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's, you can, you can definitely
see a market difference between,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the different types of fermentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people that haven't experimented
with ferments, I highly recommend ferments
[SPEAKER_01]: as, uh, as something that you could start
incorporating into your watering regimen
[SPEAKER_01]: very safely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you will see a visual
difference in your plants in a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, ferments are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to check out your
buddy's website there and probably pick
[SPEAKER_00]: something up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to irrigation real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things you touched upon was
moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a game changer for a lot of
folks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the struggles of
beginner growers is dialing and watering
[SPEAKER_00]: medium being too wet or too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes it's good with the dry
backs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help the plant, but if it's
unintentional, well, then it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm waiting for AC infinity to release
the moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening to AC infinity release
one, because that's going to be a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: send me 12 because I'll take them and I
will use them at a lot of people are using
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's the eco wet one blue mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a blue mat one right now,
the blue and moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very expensive though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 85 bucks for just one meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it's more affordable options
on the future, but it'd be really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool to be able to just look at
your cell phone and see what the different
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture levels are and then get alerts
when you need to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be really cool in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on my, my hopeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple on my short list for AC
infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing I want to dive a little bit
deeper into, cause we have folks who are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this using synthetic bottled
nutrients and that's a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_00]: than doing with organics organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of run into issues if you are
doing these dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's commonly known now that with
organics, we were using organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're relying on the microbes to actually
break down those inputs and turn them into
[SPEAKER_00]: usable nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's no moisture in the medium
or if it's too dry, those microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: actually kind of die either die off or go
dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you need to obviously resaturate
the medium in order to kind of get that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing going again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing crop steering and using
organic inputs, how would you go about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing dry backs?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually going to use the autopots
as an example, because the autopot is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually this could be applicable to
basically any sub irrigated system,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to, I'm going to speak
specifically to the autopots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a living soil setup, I'm running the
XXLs, which are 13 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very tall pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wick very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you will not be able to wick all
the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are top dressing your
amendments, then you are going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: alternate top watering when, when you were
to make sure that we're breaking down
[SPEAKER_01]: those amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perfect example was today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went in and shut off my
reservoir yesterday to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was starting to dry back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the water started to, to,
you know, go down, I have an opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: then to top dress and water from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will do this alternating probably
every, every week or so just to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the top never gets too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also making sure that, you know,
I'm able to start breaking down the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm adding in, because just by me
throwing it in there, even working into
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, it is not going to be efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, or inadequate rather,
it really does need to, to have that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that top watering part as, as part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say the dry backs are,
are immensely important because you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to have half of your,
your pot highly saturated because you had
[SPEAKER_01]: your reservoir going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start top watering as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants will, will hate you for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will take a while for it to
recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on how far along you are in
flower, it may not fully recover,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it might impact your,
your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think just being ultra aware of you
know, how much water you're putting in and
[SPEAKER_01]: the frequency and make sure that,
you know, you do have that, that dry back,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're doing a sub irrigated
system, it's really an important part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about climate light intensity
and irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some other things that people do
when they do crop steering, which kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't really fall in the categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this next one probably could,
which is EC or PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some folks will actually adjust the
EC or PPM, specifically when using like
[SPEAKER_00]: bottled synthetic nutrients, talking
organics with the inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aren't even looking at the
EC or the PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have anything to kind of talk to us
about when it comes to EC or PPM and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: steering?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have an expensive EC meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stopped using it about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I actually, I did start in soil,
regular organic soil was not organic and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and did go to cocoa for a while and,
and did the synthetic nutrients for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely what I was spending far too
much time in my garage mixing water and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was away from my family for far too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I learned of living soil and one
of the highlights being, Hey, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to measure things as much and you
don't need to pH your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to pay attention to your
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially if you're adding things
like highly acidic things or highly
[SPEAKER_01]: alkaline things, you definitely want to be
aware of it, but I don't measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, when you're working with
organic inputs, I found at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: products that I have worked with,
they don't really spike your EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though I'm adding scoops of green
aminos and build a bloom and maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: coconut and other things, my EC is staying
relatively low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am also using an RO water system out of,
out of necessity, which, which really does
[SPEAKER_01]: help in my situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have well water on my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that there are many people that
have this situation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: My PPM of my water and my, my pH naturally
is like a nine pH and was like a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was crazy high, crazy high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's unusable because as soon as I
started adding stuff, it would,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would put me over 2000 and it was,
you know, it was the danger zone at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got an RO system, just not a whole
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just under my sink in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fill up five gallon buckets,
you know, or the five gallon jugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say from the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have three of those and I have them
sitting out in my, in my garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of get to room temperature
because water temperature is also
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to put super cold water in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets to room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more tepid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also any, any types,
it also levels the pH as it sits out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of stabilizes right in around
seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, for me personally,
EC is just not much of a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's lumped into crop
stirring, but isn't talked about as often
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say is defoliation and plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defoliation, we're really talking about
like pruning, for example, pruning the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or plant training, you know,
the topping, femming, low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are resulting in the plant
having internal changes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stress response, redistribution of
hormones, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about those things,
pruning and training and crop stirring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it all really depends on what
your goals are.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me personally, as a photographer,
my, my primary objective for the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: that I run is to maintain a beautiful main
cola.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can have something that is the most
photogenic thing as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have, again, I can't necessarily
back this up because I haven't done side
[SPEAKER_01]: by side tests yet, like expansive
experimentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the limited experiments that I've
done when it came to plants that I have
[SPEAKER_01]: topped versus ones that I haven't,
I've actually found my yield to be better
[SPEAKER_01]: on the plants that I don't top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when people see my plants,
they are actually surprised when they find
[SPEAKER_01]: out that I don't top because they have I'm
able to achieve a very even canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do that by sometimes I'll bend over
the the top cola if I am right if I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that a strain is going or cultivar is
going to stretch on me or if I'm already
[SPEAKER_01]: in a situation where I know height is
going to be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will very gently train over that that
your apical meristem and your other
[SPEAKER_01]: branches are going to grow up and you're
going to have a nice even canopy that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to accomplish the same thing
that you would with with topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do believe that the yield is
better when you don't top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that my buds are bigger and more
full when I don't top when I top I get and
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect example was the trop cherry
number eight from relentless genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a this was their cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what the cut looks like when when
it is not topped.
[SPEAKER_01]: I topped it and got a bunch of smaller
beautiful buds but they were dramatically
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't fill in quite as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were spaced out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again I can't say definitively it was
because I didn't top or did top but I have
[SPEAKER_01]: found in you know my limited experience
that not topping definitely does help with
[SPEAKER_01]: with with the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will also use monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love going in or super cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty aggressive with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know depending if it's early on in
flower even if I crack off one and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know only the strong survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can also you can tape them too and
they'll be perfectly fine as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get when you do the super
cropping when you're taking and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: bending an aggressive 45 degree angle your
plant is going to readjust to that over
[SPEAKER_01]: time and grow up into the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to form this really fat
knuckle right at that point where you bent
[SPEAKER_01]: it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to improve your nutrient
like your your highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically things are going to be uptake
uptaken quicker from again from my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a that's another great way to
not just manage manage your canopies
[SPEAKER_01]: height in an emergency but to also improve
your yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also I think there are things
that we could do to to strengthen our
[SPEAKER_01]: stems because early on in veg being a home
a house plant grower I know the importance
[SPEAKER_01]: of having wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have like climbing climbing
house plants they need support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are not too dissimilar in that
where you are going to have to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: gentle breeze on them when they're young
so that your stems start to grow more
[SPEAKER_01]: rigid and stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the plant gets older and those
those stems have developed you know
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they're much stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're preparing for larger fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our buds that's that's what we're
trying to get those those bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making sure that we if we're if we're
not adding poles or some sort of a support
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know early on make sure that you have
have a gentle gentle breeze on your on
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants at all times and make sure
that they're they're going to grow up
[SPEAKER_01]: strong to support those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting deeper into wind or airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good transition here is
some people are actually using that and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to stress the plants to get a
better result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll tell you one quick story is I had
a tent full of plants and the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: was right next to the fan was much
frostier than some of the plants that were
[SPEAKER_00]: away from the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think of potential wind stress was
helping to trigger some of that secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolite production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't find a whole lot of info
online about kind of wind stress or
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow and how that can actually benefit
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any background any information
on that that kind of fills in on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experienced the exact same thing
Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually experiencing it right now
with a Pure Michigan that I'm running.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just because I'm in a in a very small
tent I've you know three plants running in
[SPEAKER_01]: a four by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan is right up against it and those
buds are the frostiest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will actually I'll upload a video later
just to show it because I think that there
[SPEAKER_01]: is something again we may not be able to
quantify it just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may never be able to but we know right
we we see it ourselves and I know that we
[SPEAKER_01]: are all trying to have like this image of
perfection like we want to have all the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves are beautiful they're all colorful
and all praying all the time and the
[SPEAKER_01]: reality is is by the end of our grow they
look haggard and beaten and weathered and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like good God put me to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have to keep in mind we are not
growing leaves we are growing flowers and
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves are are there to be an
indicator of plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be something that can show you
that there there might be an issue that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to address.
[SPEAKER_01]: There obviously are solar panels and and
they provide transpiration and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these but we are not growing leaves we're
growing flowers so don't be too
[SPEAKER_01]: discouraged if if your leaves aren't
perfect if you get the wind burn or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you get some curling from over
watering or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know learn from what may have caused
it but also know that you may have had an
[SPEAKER_01]: unintended benefit from that with that
stress response and we may never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point well we are coming up to the
hour mark here let's wrap things up now
[SPEAKER_00]: can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so you could the easiest way to find
me is on instagram at crop underscore
[SPEAKER_01]: culture underscore box do be careful there
is a a known scammer out there who is
[SPEAKER_01]: using my exact profile and everything with
a second underscore under between culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and box so you'll see a little elongated
line do be careful of that the big tip I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use telegram so if anybody tries to
tell you to tap into the telegram it ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody has any questions for me
about the box about growing I am very
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible always willing to help people
so please feel free to reach out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: also you could visit the website
cropculture.net and see the things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have available there I have a new box that
I'm going to be launching October 1st I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be announcing that on on or around
September 1st got the new breeder aligned
[SPEAKER_01]: to and got some amazing products in this
box that I'm super excited about and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think people are going to be really pumped
about as well so yeah those are those are
[SPEAKER_01]: the two main places and I appreciate you
letting me come on and and speak with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah thanks for coming on I'll definitely
have link to Chris's Instagram down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below so you
can easily navigate to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a big shout out to our
patreon supporters patreon.com mrgroat
[SPEAKER_00]: thank you so much for your support your
support keeps the lights on here in the
[SPEAKER_00]: studio I'm gonna put it on the screen
right now the folks that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: producer tier thank you so much for your
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we miss?
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can be added to the
conversation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do when you crop steer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know down in the comment section
below I love to read through the comments
[SPEAKER_00]: and see what you guys got growing on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris thanks so much for coming on to the
podcast once again this is a great talk if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to see Chris come back for a part
two let us know put part two in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comment section if we get enough votes
there we'll have him back on and we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: crank back into grow talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds great I appreciate it Chris thank
you.
