[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka MrGrowit and today I got a Q&A
[SPEAKER_00]: video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time tuning into one
of my Q&A videos, I record them live on
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitch every single month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have questions, head on over to
twitch.tv slash MrGrowit, hit the follow
[SPEAKER_00]: button, make sure notifications are on,
and the next time I go live, tune into it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can ask questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do tune into one of the live
streams and ask questions, they may be
[SPEAKER_00]: featured in a future video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's get into the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants would you recommend in a
three by three grow tent and what setup
[SPEAKER_00]: like pot size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Three by three, I would do four smaller
plants, maybe two medium sized plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: one big plant in a three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as pot size, probably three gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're keeping it with the
smaller plants, four smaller plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallons or maybe even shove a seven
gallon in that three by three and just do
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to do, you can
definitely have some flexibility there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you pH your water, does it matter if
you use a glass or plastic cup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I fully understand your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I pH my water, what I'm doing,
I use a five gallon bucket, put the water
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm taking the pH up or pH down and
then dropping it directly into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a plastic bucket is
what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're asking if it's a nutrient
solution inside that five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I'll do in order, what they say
is dilute the pH up and pH down first in
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then pour it in the nutrient
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have precipitance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, yeah, just put it into a
little, little glass of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH up, pH down, mix it in there and then
put it into the bucket of nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grote asks, what is a good bagged soil
besides the one you use in your videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, shout out to our sponsor,
Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell so hum living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Omri certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what a lot of people consider as a
super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, it's going to depend on
the size of container that you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of people are actually planting
into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil and then growing their entire plant
all the way up to harvest without adding
[SPEAKER_00]: any other nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy from them, it's a one to three
day shipping on their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can get to you pretty quickly,
depending on where you are in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely have a link to a Happy Hydro
down in the YouTube description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take you to dial in your
organic growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started using organic
inputs, I was using earth dust nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: by the green sunshine company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace that that brand is no longer
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: They closed the door and the end of 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you guys knew about that
or not, but that's a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't know that you should be
keeping the medium moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those amendments to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've been talking about
for so much over the years since I've
[SPEAKER_00]: learned that and been doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people still make that mistake is
they'll top just those nutrients in water
[SPEAKER_00]: them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll go right to what they
were doing with synthetics where they have
[SPEAKER_00]: dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the way for the medium to dry
out before watering again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, with organics, unfortunately,
the microbes go dormant and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not breaking down nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that medium moist, keeping
those amendments moist, it took me a few
[SPEAKER_00]: grows to really realize that and dial
things in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get my hands on a moisture
meter, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should make things a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Mat actually has a wax in their
company name is Sustainable Village.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a nice digital moisture media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get my hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like 85 bucks or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can get one of those,
I can dial in waterings a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, adding in the Blue
Mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps dial in the moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was the main thing in
regards to dialing in organic growing was
[SPEAKER_00]: just dialing in that moisture of the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: No till or super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: So super soil is generally just a soil
that has all the nutrients needed in it
[SPEAKER_00]: for the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like I just mentioned, so hum living
soil, they consider it a super soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: basically you just take that whole bag,
put it into, I believe, a seven gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: container for like a one point five cubic
foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bag and then plant the seed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you do a 30 day veg or
so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you flip over the flower,
there should be enough nutrients to last
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No till is just basically not disturbing
the soil at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're basically just adding on amendments
up to that top of the soil and you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: like disturbing it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two different things there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, no till is a very common
practice these days with particularly with
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, because you've got the microbes
in there that are working for you to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're disturbing the soil at all,
you're killing off microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people are going towards no
till.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could go back and give beginner
Chris one tip, what would it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: It would probably be learn what nitrogen
toxicity is because beginner Chris overfed
[SPEAKER_00]: and had nitrogen toxicity and wiped out a
grow, wiped out five plants that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: terrible because of nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beginner Chris, learn what nitrogen
toxicity is if you have very dark leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're shiny and they're curling,
then that's most likely nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And always check the PPM or EC so that way
you're not overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zaza Genetics asks, how are things going
with your Chillout OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going pretty good on the F3s right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from you, Zaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing the inbreeding, so I'm on F3s
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be planting the F3s and
seeing how they turn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for kind of the smaller
structure plant bud structure of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brisker OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a brisker OG crossed with
the Pakistan Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Pakistan Valley is a land race train
actually by World of Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the smaller structure Indica
side of things of the Pakistan Valley,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud structure of the brisker OG and
kind of a mixture of the turf profile is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so far it's going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long process, long process for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's tons of people been
asking me for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be ready this year, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fingers crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your go to dry amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: In most recent years, I've just been using
the build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked about this on my channel a
handful of times, large handful of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this actually has everything you need
in order to get through the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just one mix, one blend for the
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a separate one for veg and a
separate one for flour is what I'm getting
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll do an initial amending.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using a 7 gallon container,
one cup of build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ending it in to begin letting it cook
for a week, two weeks, planting into
[SPEAKER_00]: letting the plant grow 30 days after the
plant sprouted from the medium 20 to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding in another cup per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really every 30 days,
just a cup per plant onto the medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: top dressing it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been my go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as other amendments, alfalfa meal,
kelp meal used once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that for breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that putting that in my compost
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My worm bin, insect frass, another
amendment I like to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I can think of off top my head
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all that stuff is really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking forward to growing
the most in 2023?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually about to start a new run
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a cherry atomic sledgehammer by
welcome to the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a vanilla cola F1 by Kenobiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also doing really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be harvested within two
to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited about both of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next run I have right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole list of things,
a whole list of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just go over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Romberry by Freedom of Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know too much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up being a freebie from Attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: My old roommate had it, never grew it,
gifted it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might as well plant it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Runts by Homegrown Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amnesia Fass by Seedsman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sour Grape Rock Candy by Welcome to the
Grow Tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those four that I just mentioned are
fems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guaranteed females as long as they
sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they don't have a good male
female ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to throw some fems in there to
make sure I get some.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of these are going to be regular
so they could be even male or females.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might plant them, grow them and have to
kill them off because they end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Chiloto G by Mr. Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peyote Purple with a cross of Isoate by
Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isoate by Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Curbstomper by Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rubik's by Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Cello by Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Icarus Wings by Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me their whole line a while ago
and I've been trying to get a female out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the Rubik's Orange Cello and Icarus
Wings, but I haven't had any luck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown out the Curbstomper and Isoate
and those have been freaking fire and huge
[SPEAKER_00]: shout out to Chronic420 Inc.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a well-known breeder formerly of
North Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now he's on Prism Labs doing his own thing
and just everything I've had from him has
[SPEAKER_00]: been fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least Dead Ops OG
crossed with Persian Prince.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown out the Dead Ops OG before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still have some in the can control right
there.
