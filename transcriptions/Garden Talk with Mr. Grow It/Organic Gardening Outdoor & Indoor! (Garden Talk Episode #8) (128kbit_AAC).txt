[SPEAKER_02]: If you have your environment dialed and
you also are dialing in your feed,
[SPEAKER_02]: PH, DC, temperature, all that stuff is
dialed, you can come out with a very nice
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't matter what the line, they all
have the same kind of stuff in them,
[SPEAKER_02]: just different ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they can put a different
name on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make a serum of lactic acid
bacteria and that's inoculant you can use
[SPEAKER_02]: in water and give to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could spray lab on your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll prevent mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you water it into the soil,
it breaks down things down readily.
[SPEAKER_02]: The aeration, I like to use pumice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second best I like to use is
a hydrogen clay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I have to, I use perlite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it to the point where you just
take like the size of your pinky,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just put it in a 55 gallon drum and
you just inoculated the whole drum with
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus, beneficial fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that fungus was captured indigenous in
your area right outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Garden Talk, episode eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode's guest goes by the name
Beast Coast Farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been growing for over 15 years and
does both indoor gardening as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows a lot of vegetables, house
plants, and of course, that medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that we've all grown to love.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he reveals his gardening
methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mostly does the no till living organics
method, but he also talks about some
[SPEAKER_00]: things when it comes to growing with
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he does have experience using
those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the techniques that he talks about
in this episode are a bit more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that this podcast is for
growers of all types, beginners,
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate and advanced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are a beginner tuned into this
episode, there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: information for you in here as well.

please click that thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on one of the podcast platforms,
please leave a rating or review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think on Apple podcasts, I believe we
have two ratings so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe after this episode, we'll have
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope before we get into the video,
I would like to give a quick shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: our sponsor for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sponsor for today is Organic Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: The team at Rev sent me a sample of their
organic growth stimulant and so far my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certified organic and consists of a
naturally occurring source of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also consists of humates and microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can safely be used during all stages of
growth from seed all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase germination rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can increase root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can reduce transplant shock and it can
make nutrients more available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit organicrev.com to learn more about
organic growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also leave a link down in the
description section below so you can
[SPEAKER_00]: easily click on it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, let's get into the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Beast Coast Farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, my friend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a while since we last talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had a conversation a few years
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just reposted the conversation
we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was me, you, and then Chris from Happy
Hydro reposted out on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually, a lot of people know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually filmed that like two years ago
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know it's been a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good time though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to definitely follow up,
you know, even though it's been a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I reposted that, I got a lot of
positive feedback of people in the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: section know that they got a lot of value
out of that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people had reached out to me too,
you know, on Instagram, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just, you know, just tell me that they
got, you know, good information,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they also just wanted to go a little
deeper into like, you know, figure out
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what I'm using with my soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not, you know, not just five people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like maybe about 30 people that hit
me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so you're definitely reaching a
lot of people, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I hope to accomplish in
this episode is kind of digging down to
[SPEAKER_00]: that next level of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, exactly what you do in your
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, we all grow a little bit
differently, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some methods that I do differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the people that are listening,
they all have their individual methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: goals and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I kind of try to accomplish
in the show or a podcast is just really,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, talking one-on-one with growers,
finding out what they do in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can listen in and potentially implement
some of those best practices in their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been helpful so far and definitely
glad that you're back for a second,
[SPEAKER_00]: second time around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I appreciate it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, isn't that what we all do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we see other people doing
things, you know, um, right, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then we, we take all different people
to make it our own way, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that are just seeing you for
the first time, maybe once you tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about yourself and how you got
into growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, from, uh, from a young age,
I was always in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I would, I would be, you know,
inspecting, inspecting them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: checking out their flowers, uh,
real close.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you know, my dad,
he would, he would have a vegetable garden
[SPEAKER_02]: every year as far back as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'd admire, you know, the way you
would have everything lined up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, everything would be healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I, I would just want to
figure out how to do it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my, my grandmother to my Nana,
uh, she would have house plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had lived for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wondered how she would do that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I got older, I was starting to
get my own, um, skills, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in doing that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my grandmother actually grows
vegetables too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think that's one thing
that's kind of strengthened the bond
[SPEAKER_00]: between me and her is that we have
something to talk about, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the vegetables growing and
just growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, you can take it a step
further.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can enjoy them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can throw them at the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not just, you get it from a
supermarket.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys can enjoy something grew
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, but how I got into growing
though, you know, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just from growing other things,
uh, you know, and then I started growing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis at an early age, you know,
um, I just was hooked to growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I just wanted to figure out
how to make the best flower for myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: primarily, you know, um, cause I,
I didn't want to have to rely on other
[SPEAKER_02]: people to get it simple as that,
you know, so, um, you know, later on,
[SPEAKER_02]: I just honed my skills in that,
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so last time we talked, you were
growing a hundred percent organically,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, primarily growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had mentioned that you've grown
indoors in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still growing, uh, organic no-till
living soil outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, everything I do outdoor,
um, is all organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't, I like to be conscious of,
you know, uh, the ecosystem and what's
[SPEAKER_02]: going into the river or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I have a lot of runoff, you know,
so I like to not use synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to just use, uh, soil and water
and, and, you know, keeping it simple,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, just like, you know, just like nature
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but indoors, um, you know,
I will, I will use the synthetic indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I checked your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are growing indoors now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some plants in there, uh,
before we hop deep into the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: organic side, which will primarily be this
episode, um, just talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just, uh, maybe briefly talk
about, you know, what size grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in indoors, how many plants you're
running, what you're using for lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it varies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have, uh, I don't know,
about an 11 by 11 flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, my veg space is 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I, with that veg space,
it does a lot more than just, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: power my, my flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it, you know, I got out, you know,
my outdoor locations, um, all veg plants
[SPEAKER_02]: up, you know, um, as big as I can get them
coming into season and then put them into,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, large volumes of organic
soil and just let them go crazy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to get what I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like, um, lighting, um,
in that 11 by 11 flower room, I'm using an
[SPEAKER_02]: LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: Using the fluent spider two eyes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I just recently bought some,
um, of the specter pros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm just really liking the LEDs,
you know, what they're giving me,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, structure, you know, flower structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then my veg space, um,
I'm using T five in the cloner T five out
[SPEAKER_02]: of the cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any T five, and then I move them onto,
uh, under like a three 15 CMH,
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple of those to, uh, ready them for
the, uh, for the flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, for plants, like how many,
how many plants I put into them,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, into that flower room, it'll vary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, since, um, you know,
legal plant counts 12, I like to stay at
[SPEAKER_02]: 12, you know, nothing over 12 and flower,
even though you could fill a canopy with
[SPEAKER_02]: however many, you know, small plants to
fill a canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like to just keep it at that legal
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we will plan counts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for my four lights,
like a six to nine plant is where I keep
[SPEAKER_02]: it at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not too, not too big a pot either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep them at most, you know,
six gallons, the biggest pot I go up to
[SPEAKER_02]: for indoor, uh, with, with synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What line are you using for synthetics?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now I'm using house and gardens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, you know, you can literally
use general hydro A and D, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you have your environment dialed
and you also are dialing in your feed,
[SPEAKER_02]: pH, you see temperature, everything,
all that stuff is dialed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can come out with a very nice product.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter what the line,
they all have the same kind of stuff in
[SPEAKER_02]: them, just different ratios.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they can put a different
name on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though you primarily grow organic,
uh, and you know, you're all about
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, passionate about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you still do utilize synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do see a use for it indoors,
you know, like when you're, you,
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're in small volumes of soil and,
um, you know, you still want the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: be fed and progress and get bigger,
um, say for mother or, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever production say, like I was saying
with my, my, my, uh, bed space,
[SPEAKER_02]: how it, it does more than just power.
[SPEAKER_02]: That power, that one four by four flower
room, you know, um, with synthetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm able to achieve that, you know,
I can clone hundreds of clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: however many I take off, I can have them
all rooted, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then I put them in and then
outdoor, I can put that into, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: an organic medium and then it's organic
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, you know, I'm, I'm just giving
it an organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's flip back to the organic side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, um, let's start from the kind of
the very beginning with grill pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can talk about what grill pot size
you use and what type of grill pot to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use all, all types of pots for indoor
and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indoor in particularly, um, for
synthetics, I like to use plastic just
[SPEAKER_02]: because you can just pop them out real
easily for transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's clean up is real easily,
uh, easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like how, like, if you're going to
use a smart pot cloth, uh, with
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetics, you're going to have to,
um, wash the, the synthetic out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cloth, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if I'm with living soil,
um, I like to, I like to use a breatheable
[SPEAKER_02]: pot, um, like a smart pot, um,
grassroots fabric pots, uh, those rain
[SPEAKER_02]: science, you know, a lot of different
kinds of breathable pots, but I just like
[SPEAKER_02]: when the air, uh, the roots can air prune
to the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then also, um, it's able to,
you know, breathe more, um, and dry out,
[SPEAKER_02]: not stay too wet, but for indoors for
living soil, uh, like if you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: do for, for the pot size for its last pot
for it to flower in, I don't go anything
[SPEAKER_02]: less than 30 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, anything less than 15 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so you should do 15 or nothing
less than that basically, because if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to, if you're going to do
that, you're going to have to give it a
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic or supplement with something
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I'll use, um, one to 45
gallons, a hundred to 200 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like to build trenches and fill them
up, you know, uh, um, and do braids beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know, maybe you're
watching my channel for the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going for 11 years now,
and I think eight years, my first eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years was just all synthetic nutrients,
three gallons, five gallon grow pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, indoors, basically my entire time I've
grown a couple outdoor plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't call myself an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I've slowly ventured over to the,
um, organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to wean my way off those
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, a method that I'm trying is,
um, and I've been recommended,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've been told is seven gallons at
the minimum for, um, for organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I keep my plants very small,
so that might have to do with it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the technique that I'm going to try
this time around is, uh, vegging out in
[SPEAKER_00]: one gallon containers, kind of shaping it
the way I want to shape it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shortly before flipping to
flower, go into that seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, heavily amended with the
organic nutrients that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it makes it through most of
flower, if not the entire flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of giving it that last super soil,
um, right before flipping to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to see if that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I probably will after listening to you
and, and some other people, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 gallons, 30 gallons is probably my next
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's when, you know, your timing may
be better than mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my timing isn't, isn't always on
point, you know, so my roots are
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely bigger than the pot,
you know, um, you know, so like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I love to shape a plant before it gets
into that medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was saying, like vegging plants
indoors, I can fetch them with synthetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: get them to a big, you know, a big state,
get them into an organic medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they, you know, um, they're
Vasquez.
[SPEAKER_02]: System can, can, um, become, you know,
with organic meat nutrients instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nutrients, you know,
and there is a little bit of a transition
[SPEAKER_02]: period, you know, um, but like you were
saying though, um, when you take like a
[SPEAKER_02]: small one gallon or something,
and then right as you transplant it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you flower it and very shortly after that,
the roots are still having gotten into
[SPEAKER_02]: that seven gallon, you know, it,
there could very well be enough food for
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially if you do multiple of
those, you know, um, definitely have the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants at a manageable size, you know,
that air, good airflow can still be
[SPEAKER_02]: achieved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's all about timing and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, like I'm saying, my timing isn't
always on.
[SPEAKER_02]: My clones are only, aren't always as
healthy as I want them when I want to put
[SPEAKER_02]: them in flower, you know, or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I'm usually using a veg
plant that I have that's been veggie for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while that I put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is, uh, actually in your mix?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like to use my, uh, make my own soil
outdoor because I'm not, I don't like to
[SPEAKER_02]: buy, you know, yards and yards of some
company soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does cost a lot, you know, um,
especially when I have, the things on
[SPEAKER_02]: hand, um, that I could make myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so like I would start with like a base
soil and you need to just source,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, good quality earthworm castings
or compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get that and you combine it with deep
moss and some form of aeration and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the aeration I like to use pumice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the second best I like to use is
a hydrogen clay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if I have to, I use perlite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, the reason why I don't like using
perlite too much when you buy it in
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity, there's a lot of dust that I
kind of need to, um, clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean out, uh, you know, so I'll use the
top of the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once I get towards the bottom,
I'm, you know, I'm not like dumping the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of it on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't want to have that dust
in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, yeah, so I'll start with that
as a base soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll combine those three things together
at a certain ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, what I like to do is they,
um, third, third, third, so 33,
[SPEAKER_02]: 33, 33 mix, um, of the compost earthworm
casting, deep moss and aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I get those, um, mixed together,
I have a base soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that base soil, um, you know,
depending on the quality of your earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: castings and your compost can get you
through many weeks of edge, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: give you plenty of that, uh, vegetative
matter you require for, for flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then, so what I do with that base
soil is, is make it into super soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and I add amendments,
uh, add amendments to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that I use, um, and what I've been
using for many years now, um, is the
[SPEAKER_02]: cladness coots recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a little bit of a modified one,
um, which is super simple, which is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying you start with that base soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then per cubic foot, you do this
ratio, uh, personal per cubic foot and put
[SPEAKER_02]: a half cup of mean seed meal, a half cup
of kelp meal, a half cup of crab meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you put a fourth cup of gypsum
and then another half cup of oyster shell
[SPEAKER_02]: flour, and then two cups of basalt rock
dust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll mix that into, uh, per cubic foot
and however quantity I need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll have my super soil after I
let it sit for 60 to 90 days about,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, definitely, you know, definitely you
don't want to use it before then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say, sorry, did you say 60 to 90
days you let it sit?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, um, especially in quantity,
you know, if you have a small batch,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, in like a bin, I'm sure you
could get, get away with it being faster,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, but like when you're
controlling moisture content and you got
[SPEAKER_02]: to move, move a big pile, I mean,
60 to 90 days is just where I,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, before I put my plants until I'm
like comfortable to put plants there with
[SPEAKER_02]: no problems, you know, uh, uh,
because that mix, so that mix that I told
[SPEAKER_02]: you is, um, is a pretty, uh, hot mix too,
you know, so like it, that's, that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: no-till mix because you'll be able to get,
you know, multiple, multiple runs out of
[SPEAKER_02]: it, um, with giving just little top dress,
you know, um, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple other things I do like to add
into it, which makes it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: the modified one is, uh, insect trash,
uh, alfalfa meal and fish meal,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so I'll, I'll, I'll use those
sparingly with as much as I have,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be on the bottom of the pot
before I plant or while it's already
[SPEAKER_02]: established on top, I'll kind of capture
some of that stuff on, uh, sometimes,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, um, you know, as far as my mix goes,
you know, you could, you could use in that
[SPEAKER_02]: inside, you know, um, you know,
or, or just outside, um, but outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I would also add more organic matter,
whatever organic matter you can have
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been sitting around for a while,
whether it be rotting wood, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe at the bottom of your pot,
you know, it can just kind of retain water
[SPEAKER_02]: good and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, especially for, you know,
say a Hubel, uh, Hubel trench,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, which is utilizing rotting
wood, um, and, and culturing fungus in
[SPEAKER_02]: that wood, whether it already be in the
wood, you know, um, there, so outdoor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the mix that I would use,
it just, as much organic matter as I can
[SPEAKER_02]: get together to make the volume bigger,
um, to, to, uh, for what I need,
[SPEAKER_02]: say it'd be a large trench for Hubel,
you know, or, or a large rage bed or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I also like to get bag soil too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not afraid to use, uh,
some companies like still, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: Stonington from coast to main,
um, right out of the cloner, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, like any of my cuts, all the clones
that I have that I've been around for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So solo cup right in the stones and,
you know, water with water and just then
[SPEAKER_02]: for like six weeks, you can keep it in
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's no, with no problems,
you know, um, and that's why I like to use
[SPEAKER_02]: some bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another one, roots, organic seven Oh
seven, I won't use it inside because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: usually a has bugs, but outside I'll,
you know, if I'm short on some quality
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, I need to veg some plants in to get
them bigger early in season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll go buy some roots seven Oh seven to
get them into a bigger volume to not be
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been in for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, nectar for the gods, sunshine for
I've used another good one, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, build the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will build the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're light mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're 3.0 mix all stuff that I'll use
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all good living soil bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, before when I was, when I was
growing, um, I didn't have these types of
[SPEAKER_02]: bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there, there weren't
companies that were, that were doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which type of water do you use for your
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ro tap distilled?
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes most sense for my location and
situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'll always use our water,
um, probably for, um, with when I use
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetics, you know, I like the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of just starting with just
straight water, you know, nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then maybe, being in control of what I
put in it and then what the plants get,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so, um, you're completely scared
in the ship.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I think about synthetics,
um, when I, I use pre filtered well water,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, at locations, I'm growing organic,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so well, water's got minerals in it,
um, from where you're at that you'll,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd be adding to the adding to the soil
or the water already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just, you don't have to take it
out other, other than like when I say pre
[SPEAKER_02]: filter iron, you know, so I'll,
I have a pre filter, uh, pre iron filter
[SPEAKER_02]: before, um, I give that to my plants
because you could definitely give too much
[SPEAKER_02]: iron to your, your plants in water,
especially when you can see it and when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like brownish, brownish from a
couple, a couple, uh, spots when tap
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like say, uh, it's from a town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to use that at all just
because unless it's, um, pre filter,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, pre chlorine filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dechlorinated because I just don't like
the idea of having chlorine, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, in especially organics, um,
it could, it could, it could destroy,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so, you know, pre filtering your tap
water, uh, especially if you're in the
[SPEAKER_02]: city, you know, because they are a hundred
percent adding chlorine to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, if you, if you take some
water and res it, uh, and you have to use
[SPEAKER_02]: tap water and you don't have a filter,
you could like red, some water and a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend told me this, you could just
literally stir it with your arm and your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your skin actually takes chlorine out of
the water pretty effectively.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you don't have to do it very long.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do it for five minutes, four or five
minutes, not even, not even, and you take
[SPEAKER_02]: a large percentage, like 80% of the
chlorine out of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just mix it with your arm,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so someone that doesn't have the means
of, uh, so filter this and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but you're using tap water and
has chlorine in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a way to take it out because your
body is a better, you know, not as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, we filter as in the plant,
um, you know, especially not just the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, the organisms that are,
are working with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so how long would you dip your hand in
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, like I'm saying, you know,
like, um, say like it's a 55 gallon drum
[SPEAKER_02]: stirred around with your whole arm for
four minutes, like, and that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's even a long time, you know,
and it's obviously, you know, sitting
[SPEAKER_02]: there for four, four, four or five
minutes, just stirring with your arm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it, that literally takes out about 80
plus percent of the chlorine that would
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of your tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you think about like you go into
a pool and you come out and you smell like
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorine and that it's absorbing your skin
quite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite quickly, you know, and then the
alternative ways to dechlorinate would be
[SPEAKER_00]: just, uh, you know, let your water sit out
for 24 hours or so in light is ideal,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people have air stones in it
too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Air stones will kind of help with
dechlorinate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I may have heard that, you know,
may off gas, but I just heard,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I've heard it, you know,
if you don't have a filter and you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have a way of dechlorinating
dechlorinating before, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: just, just literally starting it with your
arm takes so much out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once my friend told me that I was
like, Sam, I'll just, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do that just to ensure that my plants,
even houseplants, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Houseplants are stirring around.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's nothing, but it's like you
do it for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually, you're actually making an
effect on the water because your body,
[SPEAKER_02]: your skin is absorbing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually tried to do a run with indoor
grow with tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my tap water comes out at 485 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think over 500 is against what EPA
guidelines or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you in like an old, are you in like
an old, old building or like a,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a city city?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be old pipes, you know,
very old pipes, maybe that must be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at the water sample
report that they release and it's like 80
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's like pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like, it just destroyed my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my plants, I've never had as
unhealthy of plants before when I used tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's even when we dechlorinated
dechlorinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been avoiding, I'd just been using
RO for now on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sodium will make your plants look
terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure, you know, and then it makes you
realize how, how, um, how important your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your water sources, you know, like your
starting water, you know, that's when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about synthetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like RO, you know, just, oh,
I test it as zero PPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like liquid gold to me when
I think about it, you know, cause you can
[SPEAKER_02]: dial, you can dial it into a T it's not
going to like, um, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have many swings PH wise up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of do you pH your water?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for synthetics, um, I always love to
dial, you know, just dialing it in,
[SPEAKER_02]: knowing what they're getting, um,
you know, whether, you know, I like to
[SPEAKER_02]: know the in and out, you know,
I'll even test my runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I do like to pH my water when I do
feed synthetics, um, outdoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, depending on your starting water,
you know, like if it's really high or low,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're saying, you know, your,
your town water, whatever the pH is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they haven't taken out quite
stable pH, but, uh, like at my farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you know, we have, uh, like a 6.2 to
6.5 well water, you know, we don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: change that at all, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, but depending on our input that we
put into that water, whether it be like a
[SPEAKER_02]: tea brew, it'll change the pH,
but I'm not worried about, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: changing the pH of a tea brew,
you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to, it's like, there's so
many buffers for organics, like in the
[SPEAKER_02]: organic medium, it's, it's a buffer zone
itself, or, um, you know, there's so many
[SPEAKER_02]: different pH ranges happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it stays in stable zone,
you know, so like, you can give it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, something that's a roundabout
and it'll become stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, so if you're giving water to
a plant and it's not a, it's not a living
[SPEAKER_02]: medium, then you're going to influence
the, that pH very heavily just by the
[SPEAKER_02]: given, you know, it's like, um,
if you water to run off, you're resetting,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, that, that pot, you know, every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, if you gave it a certain pH,
you're heavily going to influence it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, um, you know, whether it goes
up or down well water out when I make my
[SPEAKER_02]: super soil, you know, out at the,
at like a farm location while water right
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the hose, you know, right onto the,
right onto it, not having to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know that I already tested it,
that it's already in my range basically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is important for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cause, cause if you're not in
that range, you know, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: things aren't happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exchanges aren't happening with the plant
and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, yeah, you could just,
things go really awry when you're not in
[SPEAKER_02]: the right pH zone for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's good to know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about your mix, the initial
amendments that you put in there and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of how you, how you're doing your
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's talk about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've planted your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any cover crops and when do you
plant them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you plant them at the same time or
different time or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, you know, so I, I kind of just
always used, um, white Dutch clover,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, it's very, very,
really available, easy to get,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, buckwheat, um, another one easy to
get, um, uh, vetch, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: alfalfa, uh, so like a couple of different
kinds of clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use, um, red, um, crimson,
medium red, um, yellow clover,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, all good, all good ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, you know, what, you know,
what they're doing is, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: promoting mycorrhizal fungi, fungi
population, you know, and that's what you
[SPEAKER_02]: want in your, in your organic medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when I started, you know, so,
um, uh, I'll start, I'll use white Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: clover.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a solo cup, you know, um,
one gallon all the way up, because if the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant has not grown into the pot
completely and the top soil is not like
[SPEAKER_02]: root system, when you water it,
you'll, you'll have a disturbance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium, um, you know, and then when you
start to continuously water, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not going to evenly water the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a, if you have that white
Dutch clover on the top at whatever stage
[SPEAKER_02]: of growth, you have another root system
for you to just water on, um, you can
[SPEAKER_02]: water heavily and it's not going to,
it's, you know, it'll drain better because
[SPEAKER_02]: that those root systems are penetrating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you'll just have a better,
um, oxygen oxygenation of your root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just from having just a little bit of
white Dutch clover at whatever stage of
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I use a 12 seed cover crop,
um, from, from build a soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then it can, it consists of a lot
of stuff I just said, but it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's also got like, uh, cow pee.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got, um, peas, like forage peas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would eat, you know, uh, um,
the buckwheat, um, but consists of 12
[SPEAKER_02]: different kinds of seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can put, I put that in the pot prior
to planting in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, say like a couple of weeks,
get everything germinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all going, you know, and then even at
the end of the season, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, after you crop your plants,
you got your, your media, your,
[SPEAKER_02]: your beds or whatever outside,
um, primarily bed you, uh, you plant your
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop in the winter to even in the
winter time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, as soon as it comes to season,
you know, they're not going to germinate
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on how the season goes when it
thaws and stuff, but a lot of them will
[SPEAKER_02]: potentially, um, germinate as soon as the
season comes, you know, so you will also
[SPEAKER_02]: plant more as the season, um, is there,
you know, but it's like the, you already
[SPEAKER_02]: put seeds there that will germinate as
soon as they're able to outside naturally,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so at the end of the season,
when it's going to go in the winter and
[SPEAKER_02]: your beds are going to be sitting there
all winter, plant cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then in the beginning of the
season before you plant, plant your cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop, you'll have when the, when the soil
is barren, and doesn't have any other,
[SPEAKER_02]: other, uh, plants on it yet, then you,
you know, you, you plant these beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: things, and then you're going to have less
weeds kind of, you know, you don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to, um, uh, chop and dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to choose selectively
weeds, you know, you already have
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial there, um, covering,
covering the ground, which will,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, take competition away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other things that would have
germinated aren't able to germinate
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have a more developed plant
there already, you know, so the earlier
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get a cover crop on the ground
outdoors, the more is better, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as early as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the ground is really,
um, odd to plant ganja, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: then get your ganja in the ground.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cover crop, uh, what about mulch layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, common practices for,
for when growing organically is also have
[SPEAKER_00]: a mulch layer on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, uh, some people plant their
cover crops and then put the mulch layer
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately over it and have the cover
crop kind of grow through the mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what do you use for mulch layer and
how do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it's, I mean, everyone's
different methods, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I, aside from my, my living cover crop,
which acts as a, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: a mulch layer, I like to use barley,
hay, rice holes, oak leaves, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever organic matter for outdoor,
particularly, you know, whatever organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter you can just kind of chop up,
put on top of your soil just to make it so
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun isn't just hitting your top soil
directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's not, it's going to
make it dry out faster than it should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, when you can have, uh, any kind of,
any kind of cover, it could, it could even
[SPEAKER_02]: be a completely dead, you know,
say you just put like, um, like those row
[SPEAKER_02]: covers, um, cloth, I mean, you know,
just a cloth cover and it's, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to make it so just the sun isn't
hitting it directly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just staying a little more wet,
you know, more homogenous, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely the practice of having
mulch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I, I know people that don't use them,
but because their irrigation strategy is,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're monitoring their
moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they're just continuously
irrigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is primarily indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I grow outdoor, it's like,
you, you're dealing with the sun,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so it's, you, you, you gotta,
um, you gotta use like living cover crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, leaves mulch some, like I'm
saying any kind of organic matter that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can get together to put on top,
you know, just to, just to make it,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, um, more wet because of what's that
going to do is just prevent, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: promote life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you could have, uh, roots
growing right to the top layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just kind of put, pull back your,
your cover crop or your, your hay or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then roots are growing right up into
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Worms are eating things up on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned the hard way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I first switched to organics is I
lived in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the desert and, um, you know,
that top soil drying out, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes are going dormant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not actively breaking down,
uh, the organic matter at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, me not using mulch layer,
I kind of screwed myself, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: the top dressing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're applying the top dressing and
if you're not putting a mulch layer over
[SPEAKER_00]: it, well, then if that, that top layer
dries out, you're not getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: breakdown and your plants are seeing
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened with me at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, the importance of a mulch
layer, um, particularly for, for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: like me living in such a dry climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, these, you know, these types of
strategies that you can do with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with, you know, it gives you
options.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're in a desert, you know,
um, if you're growing with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, a different medium, you just keep on
irrigating, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just have to keep hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to retain water, you know,
watering it the least amount of times
[SPEAKER_02]: that's better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more sustainable, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so especially if you're growing food
outside, you know, you'd be say irrigated
[SPEAKER_02]: at night, you're in the desert,
irrigated at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, if you're irrigating during the
day, it's a lot of evaporation happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you just irrigate them all
throughout the night, potentially they can
[SPEAKER_02]: get through the whole day without being
watered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you know, it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you also mentioned in a previous
conversation that you also do like the cut
[SPEAKER_00]: method where you're kind of cutting down
the cover cup and then laying that down
[SPEAKER_00]: or, um, I don't know if you mentioned the
leaves, if you do like any defoliation and
[SPEAKER_00]: lay those down as a cover cup as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do that at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So chop and drop with no-till,
you know, and with using, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: these living soil methods, you can just
take all of your, especially no-till
[SPEAKER_02]: methods because you're utilizing worms in
a living soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just take everything that just
came off of that plant vegetatively and
[SPEAKER_02]: put it back into the pot or, you know,
or bed that you use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As like the only thing that comes out of
that pot is the actual nugs itself in the
[SPEAKER_02]: end, you know, everything else can go back
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could chop up the stems, everything
and get it back onto there and mulch it
[SPEAKER_02]: back into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis stem mulch is,
you know, best, especially if it was grown
[SPEAKER_02]: organically, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, so like what you're referring
to, um, say like your mulch, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: grows up too much, you know, it's getting,
uh, out of control, starting to grow up
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, and starting to,
uh, make airflow with strict air flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could cut it back to a, um,
manageable level, and then you could take
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that organic matter, um,
put it underneath the living, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop, and then, um, it's going to
stay wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to stay green for weeks,
literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and worms will be able to have an
opportunity to, uh, to feed on it for that
[SPEAKER_02]: time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of it, say it be on barren soil,
top soil, and say the sun's hitting it,
[SPEAKER_02]: not indoors, sun's hitting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll turn into carbon, you know,
it'll, it'll lose its moisture and become
[SPEAKER_02]: like a dry crinkled leaf so quick,
you know, instead of you just putting it
[SPEAKER_02]: under something, you can literally just
put under a rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'll take like a lot of chop and
drop, let's say like a leads.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take off the plant and I'll just take
like, uh, one of the rocks I have in the
[SPEAKER_02]: alleyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just put it underneath that,
you know, and that's just some worm food,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And within a few weeks, it's already
earthworm gases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already turned to, you know,
turned to, um, soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of worms do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nate, you know, the native worms in my
area, I like to think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I'm creating a, you know, uh,
somewhere for them to live, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like my, uh, um, my dug beds, my Hubel
mounds, uh, my raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all are like connected to the earth
and have a way of native native,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, uh, worms to come into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't even have to buy worms or add
any worms, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I have bought worms and the only
ones that I have bought are red wigglers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so, um, those are really good
living soil system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically you only have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you want to, uh, buy stuff
for a living soil, uh, for indoors,
[SPEAKER_02]: all you'd really need is just red
wigglers, but you can diversify it and go
[SPEAKER_02]: outside and go get some stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you're going to go fishing and you go
get some worms outside and then you bring
[SPEAKER_02]: them inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say you have a worm bin and then you put
them in your worm bin and now you're
[SPEAKER_02]: diversifying your, your work, you know,
your worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also what the night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the red wigglers is kind of up top soil
and then the night crawlers kind of lower
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the soil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, I forgot to say African night
crawlers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great one.
[SPEAKER_02]: They definitely are able to, um,
to get, you know, deep, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, they're fat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them look like snakes,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, yeah, African night,
well, those, you know, those two for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The red red wigglers and African night
crawlers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I'm saying any native worm that
can, that can come and live there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know you already kind of said a
little bit of advice, but do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: advice for somebody who's just trying out
worms for the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, is there a specific mount
they should use for a size real pod or
[SPEAKER_00]: what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, uh, say like you're putting a worm,
um, into a 15 gallon soil, 15,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a handful.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like a perfect amount,
you know, that, and especially if that
[SPEAKER_02]: soil is, you know, good living soil system
where they're able to proliferate and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, you know, um, and reproduce and those
eggs are, you know, they're not just
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna, you're not going to water something
on and it's going to kill everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean, if you're going to start out
new, you know, try and have a worm bin,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because then you can buy worms
and then you, you know, like I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: other than just your, your, your pots
you're growing in, you could have them
[SPEAKER_02]: reproducing and you could just take
kitchen scraps and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: have them make soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, if you're, if you're using,
if you're going to start out using worms,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to be building soil for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, yeah, I love worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip over and talk about IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you really like to talk about IPM
in our last conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked quite a bit about IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for IPM?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like to incorporate, you know,
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, like another, like, again,
you know, I like to have the beneficial
[SPEAKER_02]: insects of my area come and inhabit,
you know, my, um, my garden in,
[SPEAKER_02]: in, I invite them in, you know,
um, uh, so I don't have to order them
[SPEAKER_02]: basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like mantis, ladybugs, um, pirate
beetles, you know, lace wings,
[SPEAKER_02]: other different kinds of predromites as
far as sprays go, you know, outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use like aloe vera flakes,
neem oil, um, caranja oil, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: yucca for fighting like a pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll use the caranja oil and the neem oil
as like a, like right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll kill them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like direct, um,
I'll, I'll prune everything off the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I'll hit them with, I'll hit them
with that caranja.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but if I'm not, and I'm just kind of
doing preventative spray, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, to prevent, uh, pests and mold,
it's always like a, uh, aloe flake,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, with yucca, uh, which is just a
wetting agent, you know, just so things
[SPEAKER_02]: stay wet or longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think of it and, um, and it's
like, you're just kind of washing them
[SPEAKER_02]: down, um, periodically, whenever you want,
you know, you can put beyond your own
[SPEAKER_02]: schedule, um, your own IPM schedule for
your outdoor plants, just kind of washing
[SPEAKER_02]: down with aloe, um, indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I spray a couple of things, 203 and 209
from SNS.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'll also root drench a couple of
those whenever a problem, like if I have
[SPEAKER_02]: like fungus gnats, I'll, I'll,
I'll root drench 209 for like a whole week
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll, uh, I'll, I'll eliminate the
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're for, for synthetic, you know,
indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know Jay plants, for outdoor Jay
plant speaker, he'll spray, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: periodically, uh, EM five and build the
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, which is, keeps things very
sterile, um, and it's organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so he'll do that all throughout,
you know, his processes until he gets the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, which then he doesn't,
doesn't spray anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to spray anything in flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like your IPM is the preventative,
you know, preventative for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, proper pruning, air movement,
you know, that's crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, uh, that's all that's part of an
IPM regimen, you know, um, periodically
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure there's enough airflow,
um, and, and your air quality and your
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces are adequate for the plant's health
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's super crucial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, indoors, I'll spray plants with,
uh, citric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can make your own solution of it,
but I like to just use, uh, the big time
[SPEAKER_02]: exterminator, which is just basically
citric acid dilute, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that I've, I've, I've used that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've killed thrips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've killed, um, acid, uh, on clones,
which I took from outdoor, brought them
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and they, and then after a couple of
weeks, I see, I see thrips and stuff on
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll spray them with that, with that,
uh, citric acid, uh, every day for two
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, like I'm, like I'm power washing
the plants and I'm, and, and I get them
[SPEAKER_02]: good, you know, that's, uh, you know,
so that's another good, uh, another good
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to use that the plants aren't going
to be negatively, uh, affected by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can douse them with, uh,
with a dilute citric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely don't want to be,
you know, used too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I use, uh, the big time
exterminator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're doing the dilution for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to put any, uh, you know,
I don't have to dilute it myself and then
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck up, you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you, are you rotating these
sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing like a different spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, um, yeah, all those ones I listed,
you know, I'll, I'll, uh, I'll switch it
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, and, uh, you know, when I switch
it up, I, I'm not running into problems,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the only problem I run into
indoor is just a couple like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, or, or something like that,
which a lot of growers can have problems
[SPEAKER_02]: with, but I use nematodes and,
uh, and, uh, a couple of sprays to get rid
[SPEAKER_02]: of them quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um, one other thing I use for an
IPM is that Captain Jack dead bug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to have things that I can just
spray all over the plant and it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to negatively affect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, um, even though I,
I did list, uh, that Neem and Karanja,
[SPEAKER_02]: you a hundred percent can use too much,
you know, you want to use these sparrings.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to just think about it as you're,
um, you're, you're kind of putting a
[SPEAKER_02]: sunscreen on your, your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the, and, and then, uh,
an insect or something won't enjoy it if
[SPEAKER_02]: they come and try and eat it, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't want to put too much
because if you use too much oil,
[SPEAKER_02]: sun is hitting it and you put too much
oil, you could burn your plan just from
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun magnifying against it,
you know, and especially when it's in
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water and oil, and then the sun,
you'd literally just magnifying it on,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the leaf, it'll burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about how you, you,
you have that initial mix and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding the amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and, uh, you, you're trying to
get through the entire grow, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: with just that super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you do any type of top dressings
throughout the grow at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, when do you apply them and what do
they consist of?
[SPEAKER_02]: I apply worm castings to plants at all
stages, you know, uh, quality earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just put it right on the top soil and
water them in real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like I was saying at any stage,
all the way to end to flower if I want,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, top, you know, earth to earth,
earthworm castings are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, top dress, I top dress compost and
I'll water that in real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I use bio live.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, down to earth fertilizers,
you know, that's, uh, that's super simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, top dress that on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I transplant, like maybe after
like three weeks in the flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll, you know, I'll, uh,
I'll put some bio live on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it just consists of like it's fish
bone meal, um, fish meal, alfalfa meal,
[SPEAKER_02]: crab meal, shrimp meal, langbenite and
kelp, you know, so just a bunch of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, whatever you have laying around.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start buying, you know,
uh, a lot of bags, uh, of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: amendments, make your super soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have a lot of extra stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, whatever's laying around
at a time, you can, you can kind of give
[SPEAKER_02]: them a little boost and top dress that on
when, when it's needed, when they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: when they're kind of asking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just kind of look at the plant,
kind of read the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you see it fades a little bit and
then, and then you apply it at that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on the stage, you know,
just depending where they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be, you know, where, um, what I know where
they're supposed to be, um, at certain
[SPEAKER_02]: stages of flower or veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, and like I'm saying,
like I'll pop dress one night,
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I trans, when I freshly
transplant or say if something has been
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting in a pot for a long time and it's
roots have taken it up, I definitely have
[SPEAKER_02]: to get something on top, um, for it to
start feeding again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause, uh, the ganja plants root system,
uh, it's like a, it's like a upside down,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, iceberg.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's feeder roots are all on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you have it in a pot, it's like,
it's, it'll like take up the pot,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if it was on the ground, it would just
spread out, like spread right out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll go, it'll penetrate pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, all right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A clone will penetrate the ground 14
inches and a seed will penetrate into the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because of the tap root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, so you think of a,
uh, like, Oh, well I have a pot that's
[SPEAKER_02]: long, you know, bigger than 36 inches and
went all the way to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's those are feeder roots that would
have been on the top and they literally
[SPEAKER_02]: just go down, you know, they're in a pot,
they're in a pot and they're restricted
[SPEAKER_02]: being restricted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all, all, you know, all directions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to compensate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you incorporate any sugars into
your garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, I mean, I use molasses sometimes,
but you know, someone said to me like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's like putting tar all over your
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I understand when you use too
much of it, but I know people that use it
[SPEAKER_02]: sparingly and have good results,
you know, so sometimes I will use it when
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see a fattening in flower,
you know, to give a boost to the
[SPEAKER_02]: population of microbes, you know,
cause those are what's going to work for
[SPEAKER_02]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the, that's the reason for using
a sugar, you know, as a food source,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, um, but it's like, there's other
food sources other than, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I just, I haven't dived into using
others, other kinds of sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one thing I do use is brown sugar,
but I use it to, um, to, uh, make Korean
[SPEAKER_02]: natural farming inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So KNF, uh, like FPJ, um, from it,
fermented plant juice or making,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, uh, fish amino acid FAA.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you know, you could just take
fish, you know, or plant and you weigh
[SPEAKER_02]: them out and then you add brown sugar and,
uh, the brown sugar is taking out the
[SPEAKER_02]: water out of that, you know, so,
you know, I'm, I'm using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm utilizing the osmotic pressure of that
sugar, but then I also use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll act as a food source, you know,
for microbes when I water that in as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not primarily straight brown sugar,
you know, I won't just put brown sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: into water and that water that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, molasses and the brown sugar
from my, uh, KNF inputs are the only two
[SPEAKER_02]: sugars I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use any of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like root wise organics,
um, in for indoors, great white mammoth
[SPEAKER_02]: microbe at, you know, as Oh, um,
EM one, EM one is, uh, is lactic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not just like the gas bacteria,
but, um, you know, that's another thing
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll add.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll make my own lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can take, you can take,
uh, unpasteurized milk, right,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, right out of the cow and you mix
it with, uh, water that you had,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you take rice, you, you wash the rice
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You watch this, wash the starch start off
the rice and you take that rice,
[SPEAKER_02]: wash water and you mix it with,
uh, the unpasteurized milk and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you can, you can make a serum of a
lactic acid bacteria and that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, inoculant you can use in water and
give to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could spray lab on your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll prevent mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you water it into the soil,
it breaks things down readily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, think about it as like
utilizing the stomach of the, of the cow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has like five stomachs and it has these
lactic acid bacteria, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in its stomachs is the same thing as us,
but, you know, we have our lactic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they also have, they have five
stomachs of it, you know, so you're
[SPEAKER_02]: utilizing what that does in its stomach in
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you put over on your soil,
and it helps break things, helps break
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter down into a soluble form
for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other K and F inputs I'll do,
you know, um, which I learned from online,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, Chris, uh, through Chris Trump,
uh, are, uh, IMO one through five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll take indigenous microorganisms,
um, which is fungus, uh, bacteria living,
[SPEAKER_02]: living in your, you know, outside in
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you'll, you'll capture it and
you'll get that into a state that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: then, um, put into water, which then,
you know, makes the spores go into
[SPEAKER_02]: solution and then you water that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that those methods are,
are, are, um, something I'm very new to
[SPEAKER_02]: the IMO one through five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't dived into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way I even know a lot about them,
I just literally go on YouTube and go to
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Trump's, uh, YouTube and I'm taking
notes on it, you know, um, until I get my
[SPEAKER_02]: own experience, you know, I'm getting good
at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but you can get it to the point where
you just take like the size of your pinky,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just put it in a 55 gallon drum and
you just inoculated the whole drum with,
[SPEAKER_02]: with fungus, beneficial fungus,
you know, and that fungus was captured
[SPEAKER_02]: indigenous in your area, right outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have like a field or something,
um, and underneath the tree that,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you go and you look under some
leaves, it's nice white mycelium growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the stuff, you know, you could get
that in your own grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not just outside, cause that's the
best types of microbes you can use is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is what's in your area that grows best in
your climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, another, another kind of inoculant
though, you know, I'll take freshly picked
[SPEAKER_02]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got like beach mushrooms that are
growing, um, kind of in a low,
[SPEAKER_02]: low area on my property.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'll just take those fresh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll put them in a tea bag that I'll like,
I would brew a compost tea in and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: just soak those 24 hours, very heavily
aerated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then just water that all over,
all over the bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll take what's in the bag and
I'll just mulch that on the top layer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'll take that all those chopped
up, uh, mushrooms I harvested a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: days, you know, yesterday, and then just
mulch that all over the top soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've seen, uh, you know, big blooms
of, of mycelium come after I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aerated compost teas, let's talk a
little bit more about more about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What aerated compost teas do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any like nutrient teas,
seed spotted teas, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do compost tea, um, in
particular, um, I'll take earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: casting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll take nice quality compost and just,
uh, make a nice aerated tea with just
[SPEAKER_02]: those things, you know, because that's,
that's a real benefit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, whenever, um, you can brew it
up, say you want to do it two to three
[SPEAKER_02]: times a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you can, you don't have to do the
same key every time you could do just
[SPEAKER_02]: compost that you do another tea,
tea brew of, um, of, uh, you throw some,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, mineral in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you put salt, you put oyster
shell flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could, you could put some caliper,
whatever, like I'm saying, whatever you
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to put, um, in small
amounts and brew it up into solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but another thing where we're brewing
is, uh, the time you do it, because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want it to go anaerobic and it can
go anaerobic really quick on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you brew it for say over 24 hours
and I don't like to do brews more than 24
[SPEAKER_02]: hours now, now that I learned that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, you brew it and then you stop the
aeration, you don't feed it and you let it
[SPEAKER_02]: sit there for not even a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very heavily anaerobic, um,
you know, and, and, uh, you can make,
[SPEAKER_02]: things go awry in your soil system with,
with giving them large volumes of
[SPEAKER_02]: anaerobic teas, you know, um, or if it's
too concentrated and you don't dilute it,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely make a tea and then dilute
that and then give it to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as sprouted seed teas, um,
I haven't, I haven't used sprouted seed
[SPEAKER_02]: teas much, um, at if, you know,
if not at all, I've taken some corn and
[SPEAKER_02]: sprout and, uh, and done some stuff with
corn, but, um, I've just heard that it
[SPEAKER_02]: can, um, negatively affect, uh,
fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's definitely, um, going to have to
help the root system because it's sending,
[SPEAKER_02]: sending signals, um, with enzymes that
those, those, those seeds had,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you could, with the, with the
possibility of it negatively affecting,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, what I'm trying, a population of
fungus that I'm trying to promote and have
[SPEAKER_02]: live, you know, I just don't try it,
you know, um, I may try it on small
[SPEAKER_02]: volumes of soil, like 30 gallons and I'll,
I'll brew some seed and I still haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: done it in all my experience, you know,
I, um, I just know you could, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: pop seed, you know, sprout a bunch of corn
or sprout seeds, blend them up and then
[SPEAKER_02]: give them the plants and it helps them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I have friends that do it and tell me
it gives them bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, but then I have people
that tell me it negatively affects their
[SPEAKER_02]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just why I'm hesitant to do that,
sprouted seed teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as other oxygenated,
uh, compost teas, fungal, fungal teas,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want that type of stuff to as often as
you can do it, like two to three times a
[SPEAKER_02]: week is a good time, is a good amount,
a lot, you know, um, um, and, and
[SPEAKER_02]: sparingly, you don't have to root drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just give a little bit to them
just to keep the soil moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more thing about the cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I was looking, you know,
I'm building a tea brewer right now and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I see a lot of people on the market
inflating the called the volcano,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, style, which is like you just,
it's a big bubble tech tech, and it just
[SPEAKER_02]: sends a big, you know, um, amount of air
from the bottom up instead of,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, doing, you know, which is another,
another kind is the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cyclone, you know, um, there's more
moving parts to that cyclone, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: tea brewer, um, that you'd have to clean
or, or, or whatever, but, um, the volcano
[SPEAKER_02]: one, uh, less moving parts, um,
and it, and it brings you to dissolve
[SPEAKER_02]: oxygen levels faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those, that's what I'm looking into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just retrofitting a V bottom I already
have, um, with a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, so I went to synergy ag pro.com,
uh, which took me a little bit of time to
[SPEAKER_02]: find this and they have a stainless steel
manifold, uh, that goes, um, with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, with clamps on the bottom of your,
uh, your V bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, and then you can hook up,
you know, a, a diaphragm pump to that as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as a air pump.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, uh, in particularly you want to
use diaphragm pump because if you use
[SPEAKER_02]: another pump with a propeller,
you can, you can, um, negatively affect
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbes you just brewed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so you could negatively affect
them while you're pumping them to your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not using a diaphragm pump and
you're using a pump with a propeller,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it'll just chop the little guys
up real good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just recently, I just recently learned
that too, which is pretty intriguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, diaphragm pump, diaphragm pump
when you're feeding your, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding a compost, you know, or you,
uh, um, you know, do something by gravity
[SPEAKER_02]: or hand feed it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a viewer question from the last
episode that we, um, we filmed,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you were talking about a geodesic dome
that you were just purchasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, first off, if you can just explain
to the viewers what a geodesic dome is and
[SPEAKER_00]: then also how you utilized it,
how it turned out for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The geodesic dome, you know, it's a dome
made from triangles and, uh, that
[SPEAKER_02]: structure itself is super strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, very, very, you know, it can take a
snow load, a snow load.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's why people like using for
greenhouses, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so say mine is rated for a hundred
feet of snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rated for the, an Alaskan snow load
where the snow would fall and not melt and
[SPEAKER_02]: then continue to snow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the geodesic dome is just super,
very nice, strong structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have the polycarbonate plates
on the outside of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's rated for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, when they have their
polyethylene soup houses, you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: replace it sometimes every season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you can get by maybe three years,
two to three years, and then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: replacing your plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of it being, you know,
me buying the extra investment and putting
[SPEAKER_02]: down for polycarbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, um, I don't have to replace
that for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just clean the panels off on the outside
and inside and keep them, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been posting much about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The town that I, that we're growing in,
um, just kind of gave us a hard time when
[SPEAKER_02]: we were first starting out, you know,
they saw a lot of plants, um, and they
[SPEAKER_02]: came, they came knocking basically,
you know, and they're all hemp plants
[SPEAKER_02]: though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but, uh, I just haven't been posting
for, for that reason, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're kind of keeping it on the GL.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I will be posting about it in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, once, once we're more comfortable,
we're doing a lot of retrofitting soon
[SPEAKER_02]: with that, with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we're, we're going to be installing
the Agnetics light with, um, either
[SPEAKER_02]: radiant and heated beds or, um,
benches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, which are really cool because,
um, those, those, that will help,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, keep the environment as well,
you know, so, um, we're, we're excited for
[SPEAKER_02]: those retrofits, um, soon, but,
uh, yeah, hopefully down the road,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I'll be able to post more about it,
um, on my Instagram, but also I'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: having a YouTube that I'll be,
uh, I'll be doing that I'll be primarily
[SPEAKER_02]: about the hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so people can look forward to that
about the geodome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few more questions and then I'll let you
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what advice do you have for growers who
are just getting started with organics?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely the, the laid back form,
you know, of growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, you have more, more of a
buffer zone, you know, you could kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mess something up and it's not as
detrimental as growing with, with,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, salts, you know, so that's a good,
a good thing about, you know, going down
[SPEAKER_02]: this, this rabbit hole kind of,
um, but you don't want to, you don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: to go into it thinking, you know,
everything, um, you know, things could be
[SPEAKER_02]: going well, but then you're presented with
something that's foreign and you just not
[SPEAKER_02]: ready, you know, so, um, you definitely
want to kind of wrap your head around
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that could, um, what's going
on, what could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause, uh, scaling it is tough,
you know, doing it on a small scale is,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, the way really doable, but doing
organics on a large scale, you need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: on your toes for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it could be the very laid back,
you know, for, for growing in on a small
[SPEAKER_02]: scale and be the style that people want,
you know, to get it on cruise control
[SPEAKER_02]: though, it's like, yeah, like you need to
wrap your head around it because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what it can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it can be, you just,
you're just watering it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to be doing much pH and of
anything, and it can give you more time to
[SPEAKER_02]: do other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and maybe check out Chris
Trump, you know, on, on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_02]: because, uh, he's, he's one of like a
mentor and someone that, that,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, even me, you know, with all my
experience, I'm just learning so much from
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I take so many notes and I still need to,
uh, get into, um, that, um, K and F,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, techniques more, you know,
cause they can be so beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and also maybe follow build a soil on
Instagram, um, check their website out so
[SPEAKER_02]: much free information, everything you
could want to start out as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a home grower, uh, you can just get
shipped right to your house, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and, um, which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that never was an option in the
past, um, to be to do this organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have to really look into it and
figure things out yourself, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so checking those dudes out,
it would, would give you a real,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, one up for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, how can listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, uh, you can, you know, uh,
reach out to me on, on my Instagram,
[SPEAKER_02]: East coast farmers, um, at the East coast
farmers on Instagram, DM me anytime,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, you could, uh, I'm going to have a
website up pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be selling, uh, apparel, um,
you know, grinders, you know, these kinds
[SPEAKER_02]: of sweatshirts on it, East coast farmers
.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, so yeah, you know,
and then another thing, the YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel, which I'll have a little bit down
the road, hopefully this year about the,
[SPEAKER_02]: about the hemp and the geodesic dome,
um, that'll, you know, you could just look
[SPEAKER_02]: up East coast farmers on YouTube,
you know, we'll, we'll have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and thanks to you, you just type in
because farmers, your ears is the first
[SPEAKER_02]: one that pops up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alrighty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, beast coast farmers,
thank you so much for coming on to my show
[SPEAKER_00]: for, um, well, actually this is the first
time we coming onto this show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we had a conversation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on whole
walls of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered a lot this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who's watching, I will leave a
link to his Instagram down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So head on over there, give them a follow
and, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any final words?
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to thank you, you know,
having me on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the idea of reaching so many people
and getting, you know, good information
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got it from others,
individuals that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to give free information out there
like myself too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so, um, we just keep passing
that along and, uh, hopefully we see a
[SPEAKER_02]: change happen, you know, um, in our
community for the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it just, you know, I appreciate you
having me on here, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're doing, you know, good things
with your YouTube and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
