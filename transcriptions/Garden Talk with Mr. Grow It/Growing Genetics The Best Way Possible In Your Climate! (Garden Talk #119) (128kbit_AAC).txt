[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 119.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Steven
Reisner, but many of you know him as
[SPEAKER_01]: Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been on the podcast once before,
episode 64, where he talked all about
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I got him back on the podcast,
this time he talks about growing genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way possible in your climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Steven has grown in several states across
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: and several countries around the world,
so he has a lot of experience growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: different climates, and he reveals a lot
of great information that relates to this
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.

[SPEAKER_01]: We're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Stephen Reisner.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did one episode in the past,
so some of you might remember that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes by Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last episode, we talked all about
aquaponics, which isn't a very popular
[SPEAKER_01]: growing method, but you can definitely
grow some really good plants that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, we're going to switch things
around, really going to talk a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic diversity and growing genetics the
best way possible for your climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's so many differences that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have so much experience growing around
the world, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been growing in different
countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a really good
conversation with you to reveal some
[SPEAKER_01]: information, tips, tricks, and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too deep into the episode,
can you introduce yourself for the
[SPEAKER_01]: audience members who don't know you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Steve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a company called Potent Ponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a podcast called Growing with
Fishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been around now for eight years,
so we've been making a lot of awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: content similar to yourself with a lot of
similar type structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main work is doing consulting for all
different types of living soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics systems and farms all around
the world with a variety of crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: the majority of it being medicinal plants
or essential oil producing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the rest of it being food
production crops, mainly organic certified
[SPEAKER_00]: for the aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a lot of people that can come
in and set up those types of facilities or
[SPEAKER_00]: troubleshoot them when they run into
auditing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of internal audits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, the last five years or so,
going to different countries and setting
[SPEAKER_00]: up large facilities, specing out the
equipment, specing out the systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pumps, the filtration, setting up the
different SOPs and all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: protocols, and then coming up with
different solutions, especially in oddball
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we'll get into some of them in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning different things in different
cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like every part of the world has
a different piece of the puzzle really
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out to the unteenth degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fun to learn from these
different indigenous cultures and combine
[SPEAKER_00]: all that knowledge into a working system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What countries have you grown in or areas
have you grown in?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be quite a long list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just spitball off a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in Canada, all across the US,
Puerto Rico, Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimbabwe, South Africa, Thailand,
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm forgetting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, St. Vincent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been to Gros in Swaziland or East
Swatini now, as well as... Sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm forgetting somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Laos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some Gros in Laos as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt, all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's first get into genetic diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is meant by genetic diversity?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetic diversity is what is the different
phenotypic expressions of the different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in a given region, but also
mutations as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have things like freak show,
ABC, and crows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of other ones as well that
can be genetic variation, but mainly what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to talk about today is the
differences between the different land
[SPEAKER_00]: races and the different stuff that was in
different regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamaica, for instance, had very few land
races.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was almost no land race left by the
time I was there in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of it had been cross-bred with
western polyhybrid stuff that really...
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one time that I see anything that
was even pretty natural looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really surprised me because Jamaica was
always known as being this really wild
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cool genetics there,
but it's almost all contaminated with
[SPEAKER_00]: western stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, when I was in Africa,
especially in remote parts of Zimbabwe,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of that stuff has seen any kind of
outside genetics because of the wars and
[SPEAKER_00]: the isolation and the sanctions and all
the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't a big export culture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not bringing in different genetics
in order to cross-breed for export.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just growing what they like and
what's been growing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always interesting the different
motivations of the different places.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it this way,
too, why is it that the biggest places in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world for the different genetic
diversities that are known for being these
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenters are Jamaica, which was a huge
trade hub in the Caribbean, Durban,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a huge trade hub in southern
Africa, especially anywhere really where
[SPEAKER_00]: you had the... What was the name of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The East Indies Trading Company or West
Indies Trading Company or whatever it was
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere in the 1700s, 1800s where you had
a lot of this heavy trade, that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of the meccas for these
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Morocco being another one that was a big
trade hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these different places that we think
of as being the best places to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: source out genetics, most of them were
huge trade hubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, from 1100 through the
1800s, you would keep hemp on your boat as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of your sail production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In case you have a shipwreck, you can grow
your own ropes and sails and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other plants as well, medicinally,
that they would grow to keep as medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: on the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have a lot of these
different really cool land races in the
[SPEAKER_00]: specific regions that you have is because
it was part of your boat, standard boat
[SPEAKER_00]: repair kit for the better part of a
thousand years.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did any kind of long sea travel,
you brought pine trees, which is why you
[SPEAKER_00]: have pine trees everywhere and also why
they call everything that you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: into a mast a pine tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of non-pine trees that are
called pine trees is the common name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another reason for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all these different stuff,
but that's the reason why you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: epicenters of genetics for medicinal
plants that we all enjoy is because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that boat repair kit type stuff and then
people growing large volumes of that and
[SPEAKER_00]: finding through phenohunting those better
cultivars in those regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the medicinal plants have been
transferred all around the world at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some genetics, they might grow really
well in one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't grow well at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually can grow bad in other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A great example of this would be leaf
width.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came back from living in Thailand
for almost a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: The really narrow leaf varieties of plants
grow much, much better in Thailand or
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freak Show would be another one that does
extremely well because of the reduced leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hot sun, they don't get heated up
as much and they don't have to sweat as
[SPEAKER_00]: much and drink as much water, not sweat,
but respirate through the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not losing as much water per day
because they have a reduced surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can grow much easier and have a lot
less heat stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you take a broad leaf,
like a plant that came from a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: northern climate, you're going to have
instant leaf burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get sunburn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those plants are going to have to work a
lot harder to bring up more water because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're losing more water per day through
the leaf structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really can make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest reason why you would
choose one or the other or the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: things to look for when you're growing in
the tropics versus growing in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: In northern climates, it doesn't matter if
it's narrow leaf or broad leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere near as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in the tropics,
if I take a broad leaf variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not going to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even saw that in a lot of the genetics
we were testing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that was super, super broad leaf,
a lot of blueberry and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: just fried in the sun because it just
couldn't handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freak Show really is one of the best ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow in full sun in a
really, really brutally hot climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really, really is one of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Durban would be another one that grows
extremely well, does not care if it's 105
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do just fine in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, can these genetics adapt to different
climates?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, could you take a broad leaf
from the northern climate, bring it down
[SPEAKER_01]: to the tropics, and then have it grow
naturally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say it's out in the wild outside,
and over 20 years, let's say 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: later, will that genetic adapt or will you
just see poor growth for that 20-year
[SPEAKER_01]: period?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you definitely could have some
level of adaptation if you could get them
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish off.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of cases, the plants don't make
it all the way to harvest because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and the stress and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pest pressure, that's another one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, when I was in Thailand,
if you're in the marshy areas or the rice
[SPEAKER_00]: fields, like where I was growing
initially, those are all almost limonene
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant completely in terms of chemover
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That limonene really does help get rid of
those bugs that like that environment
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in the mountains, you get more of
the chocolates and the mangoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the other funkier sandalwood type
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really is more adapted to the
whitefly and the other different pests
[SPEAKER_00]: that are up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the plants that are surviving and
not getting eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plays a huge role in that terpene
expression as well, as well as what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to survive and not survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other component to it,
aside from just the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one too, I was at two different
facilities and I've seen thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically feeding on pineapple flavored
varieties, eating all of the pestles off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They eat just the pestles off,
which is really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good if you don't want pollination,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just crawl up to the top,
eat all the pestles and then go back off
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the weirdest thing, but I've seen
that on two separate occasions,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically with pineapple flavored
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you even just get a pest that
really queues in on one or two cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just can't grow those particular
cultivars because the pests are like
[SPEAKER_00]: magnets to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times too, hey, if those particular
couple of plants are going to take all my
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs off of the rest of the plants,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll sacrifice those and we'll just
sacrifice those to the Lord of Light at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do our ticks that we find on ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sacrificial plants can be handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people grow plants
specifically for that, to try to attract
[SPEAKER_01]: pests to those so the other plants can
grow well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get deeper into the different
areas you've personally grown in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried to transfer genetics from
one area to another and just seen a poor
[SPEAKER_01]: result or had a good result?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere I've go, we've found ways to
get the genetics there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the first legal person to import
seeds to Zimbabwe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went to go pick up the seeds at the
airport and I don't know if I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: this story or not, but we went to go pick
up the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all my paperwork from the health
department and they're like, you're here
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick up the seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're going to get arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us your paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he checked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the right seals on it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he goes up to his boss, comes back down
and he puts the box out with all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes to test their dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because they're having fun with it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once everything's on the up and up and
then they put take it out and they search
[SPEAKER_00]: around, the dogs don't hit on the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went from being really chummy to
like really pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a pretty scary few minutes
until we could get the box and get out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the airport.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've grown a lot of different places
and I would say that the only time we
[SPEAKER_00]: really had a lot of negative issues was,
well, partially was trying to get CBD and
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG cultivars to grow in the tropics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those in particular were very difficult
because the heat and the natural higher
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese in Zimbabwe in particular has a
really high base level of manganese in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have high manganese,
that tends to really increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: expression of other particular compounds
that you don't want if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow for EU compliant cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of pushes that outside of the
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between that and the heat, it kind of
causes you to always test hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big problem that was really
hard to kind of deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, we really ended
up selecting through phenotypic and
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar selection, finding the right ones
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did take, we got to get rid of
about 40% of them because they just were
[SPEAKER_00]: always testing hot for the compliance that
we had to grow for that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the only time we really had a
ton of problems with the cultivar
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you always have a percentage of
what you're going to try to grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to hate that climate and
just do crappy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the game, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what you're trying to do,
there's always going to be a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of genetics that are just going
to not like your particular grow method no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also too, just making sure that
you can kind of get the biosecurity that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need in a lot of these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're used to growing traditionally,
and that can be a big difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was kind of the biggest problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Jamaica, nothing really gets that
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very few of the genetics I've seen that
were really growing in the hills,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get much above three or four
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting that much yield per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was definitely another issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go with much more denser
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some videos and stuff on my YouTube
of what that looks like in the hills above
[SPEAKER_00]: out in Westmoreland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of good friends down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love going down to the island and
hanging out and seeing a bunch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lots of good homies down there and
spend a lot of time down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe was really weird
because we had a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional Rastafarian growers that just
were growing gigantic trees and they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't care if it was taking six or eight
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the best pining cultivars I've
ever had were, and I still have,
[SPEAKER_00]: are from the hills in Nyanga, up kind of
on the Mozambique-Zimbabwe border.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of incredible genetics there
that are totally uncontaminated still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that kind of sub-Saharan
Africa is kind of the last place on earth
[SPEAKER_00]: that, aside from maybe the Himalayas,
that has a lot of untapped genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been contaminated yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only place I've seen a lot of
genetics was in Zimbabwe and on the border
[SPEAKER_00]: with Mozambique there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down, I don't think I saw anything
that had any kind of Western structure to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very, very nice, gigantic
candelabras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was interesting there is they
brag about how many snakes you get on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, if you have a lot of snakes on
your plants, the snakes will rub
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves on the resin glands to get rid
of ticks and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it makes them, they don't like the
resin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a bragging rights if you have
like lots of snakes in your grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I thought was a bit insane
considering the species there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, you have to deal with green
mambas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not down for finding snakes in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never heard that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned like a percent of genetic
genetics kind of not working out for the
[SPEAKER_01]: average home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say, like if they're
ordering seeds online from a different
[SPEAKER_01]: country or whatever, and they get it and
they try to grow them within their home
[SPEAKER_01]: grow indoor setup, what percentage of
genetics would you say won't work out?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say, you know, avoid stuff
that's from the tropics that gets large.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the number one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we recently had the temple tie that I
did a collab with with Jordan on Growcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we released a bunch of those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest issue with those,
they get, you know, 10 feet tall by week
[SPEAKER_00]: nine from germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to grow that in a
tent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hack the crap out of it to
grow some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So avoid those types of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of your traditional
equatorial land-raised stuff, not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: really do well indoors or, you know,
maybe start it indoors and then finish it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do that, that's going
to be your biggest, you know, challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, otherwise, just if you do decide
to take them on, just prune the living
[SPEAKER_00]: crap out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure, you know, every four to eight
days you are doing some type of light trim
[SPEAKER_00]: on it to keep them manageable in size or
train them or, you know, super crop them
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is you need to do to keep
them inside your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also to remember, like most cultivars,
with a few exceptions, kind of stop
[SPEAKER_00]: growing after about 24 to 30 days in terms
of stretching once you flip their life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, keep in mind that that plant
might grow another, you know, two feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: three feet on some of these more
equatorial strains that don't queue in
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as hard as some of the northern
strains that are a little more used to
[SPEAKER_00]: queuing in on that indoor 12-12.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes it can take them a
little longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have, you know, you don't want
that thing to be growing up into the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and not having even flipped yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen people do that too and
just have to totally make like baskets out
[SPEAKER_00]: of their room, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And correct me if I'm wrong, but the
genetics that are down in the tropics are
[SPEAKER_01]: more longer flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowering strains, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So look at 11, 12, 13 plus weekers
sometimes down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even longer, you know, there's
definitely some cultivars I've seen both
[SPEAKER_00]: in Africa, especially in Africa and to a
lesser extent in Thailand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can take you, you know, four or five
months of flower and a real, real long
[SPEAKER_00]: time to actually finish off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also as interesting as a lot of the
equatorial varieties have a minimum time
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have like, they're going to veg
for two months or three months,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter if you start them in 12-12 or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the temple tie that I have absolutely
like, it's going to get to 10 feet tall no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter what, unless you are hacking the
crap out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's under 12-12 or even 11-11,
you know, or 11-13 rather, it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to grow like, you know, absolute
gangbusters and just ignore the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know, 50-50 because it's strain
grew up the whole time in the equator,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to, it's used to that 12
hours and 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has kind of a minimum flowering
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's cool about it is some of them,
once you're past that time, you can take
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts of them and they'll finish in,
you know, nine to 12 weeks, which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: that much far off from a lot of your
typical cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of stuff now is eight
weeks, but most stuff is really nine or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them can still fall into that
range, but you're going to have to veg it
[SPEAKER_00]: for like, you know, four or five months
before, you know, that mom before you
[SPEAKER_00]: could really do anything with it in terms
of quick fruit flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing to take into
account too with the equatorials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't hear people talk about it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one that I've noticed too is
with the equatorial stuff and to a lesser
[SPEAKER_00]: extent with the CBD lines as well,
if you keep them under 24 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: it causes herming and a lot of like
hormonal problems where I'll get nanners
[SPEAKER_00]: on them if I have them under 24 hours of
light for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I flip them and just do a 12-12 or
even 16 and eight, I don't have any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the nanners stop and they never come
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any flowering problems with
them throwing nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that like, stress of not
sleeping I've noticed particularly in land
[SPEAKER_00]: race as well as CBD in particular seem to
really, you know, heavily fall into that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that range where it's going to be a huge
problem for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't heard that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten myself into a little bit of
hot water, I guess, just to say to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: ignore, I don't say ignoring flowering
time, but like I grow a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different cultivars in the same tent and
you know, I didn't really look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time too deeply on one of the
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually Hades thrown by Zaza
genetics, shout out to Zaza.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one went for like 12 weeks,
everything else finished at eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this one was just lagging beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew something was up once I flipped
to flowering and it was stretching and
[SPEAKER_01]: stretching and stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then four weeks into it, it's like
still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That at that point I knew it was a longer
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, I thought it was a really
good tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you mentioned is like, yeah,
be aware of this stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like plan around it because you could get
your hands on some genetics and they may
[SPEAKER_01]: sound good, but if you're not looking at
the flowering time, that could really
[SPEAKER_01]: throw your girl a little sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're someone like me, it was growing
a whole bunch of different plants in one
[SPEAKER_01]: grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could have a whole bunch of
plants finished first, then have this one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant lagging could throw off your whole
growth cycle.
Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I would mention too is
like, if you have Zamaal, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: reunion Island ram land race, which very
few people actually have, but I'm one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that managed to get my hands on
some, um, shout out the woman who gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: those, you know, so she, who it was,
um, uh, the other one that I've seen with
[SPEAKER_00]: the same trade is freak show in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a friend of mine, uh, Canada,
um, he has a really good, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar of freak show that does the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, those two strains I've seen or
heard of them in the case of the Zamaal,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the reunion Island land race,
um, or actually can continue to grow post
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll just revedge and then flower
again, revedge and flower again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep going back and forth between
those two states so you can grow them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of perennially without
having to harvest the whole plant back,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few plants in the whole gene
pool that have that mutation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've only seen in person the freak show
do it, but I also know that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people claim that Zamaal does it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that's kind of something where,
Hey, if you're going to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you have a big structured plant
and you're growing it indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the tropics and you can just
let it grow in your yard all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's not a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually a benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kind of dialing in exactly what
it is you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want from the plant and the size
of the plants that you want for your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular indoor grow is going to be a
big factor into what your selection is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to circle back to pest control
challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: What pest control challenges have you
faced growing in different areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have any tips for just general,
I guess, IPM or pest control that dome
[SPEAKER_01]: grows can take away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, there's quite a bit to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, when I was in Jamaica,
for instance, in May and Puerto Rico is
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way anywhere in the Caribbean,
anyone that's grown there knows this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you have butterfly season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the butterflies, basically not all
of them, but it feels like all of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: like 60% of the butterfly species all have
like lay eggs at once in April.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all hatch out and you have the
swarm of butterflies that are all looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to lay eggs all over everything in May in
particular and anywhere in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but if you know that that's coming,
you can make get ready in March and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of keep VT on your plants in March and
April and kind of head that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that the soon as they're on the
plants, there's something already working
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of thing where once
you've been through a place through a full
[SPEAKER_00]: year or even talking to local farmers,
Hey, what do I need to worry about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next three months?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I need to worry about next four
months?
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of learning from the locals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's oftentimes in the most of the
world, it's the women that know all that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the men, the men are the ones off
running, you know, fixing the tractors,
[SPEAKER_00]: driving, doing all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the women in Africa and the Caribbean
and many of these other places that are
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones actually working with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're always the, you know,
finding the old wise woman in town is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one you need to talk to 90% of the time in
a lot of these different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially more far away places if you
really want to get the good agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had 80% women working in Zimbabwe with
us and they were teaching us all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool stuff in terms of identification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another great trick for identifying,
especially in a large scale for
[SPEAKER_00]: caterpillars is go out at night with a
black light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The caterpillars and a lot of other
insects will glow like little Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: ornaments on your plants and they're
really easy to spot and scout.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why, especially in the summertime,
I'll switch my work crews to in June
[SPEAKER_00]: through August to work at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will start off at one or two AM and
then finish up by like 11 or noon so that
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's going to be a hundred and you
know, whatever in the middle of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're finishing up right as it's getting
hot, you know, same thing anywhere where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the work schedule you have to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's cool is it makes it super easy
to start the day by scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with black lights and,
you know, looking around and seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: the heck is going on in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a great way to kind of deal
with a lot of those issues in Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Zimbabwe, we ran into some new issues
that I hadn't run into before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had large locusts and grasshoppers
that would come in and eat the center
[SPEAKER_00]: Cambrian layer of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go up about a foot and a half,
two feet high, eat all the bark off and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the plants would just flop over,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what do you do against
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, you know, we're getting
overrun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this all happened right when COVID hit
the South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they immediately sealed all the borders
with South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And South Africa is where the only place
we could import bio controls from,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we could use for reselling the
Western markets because that was the goal
[SPEAKER_00]: was to export all of the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically got cut off from all of
our supply and I'm getting overrun by
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call up Chris Trump and I was like,
Hey man, I'm kind of panicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to do right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give you some ideas on like
something I can make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I am like cut off from the outside
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't import anything now because they
have like, you know, all the borders are
[SPEAKER_00]: shut now for bringing in anything because
of COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me about a method where he
had, he did an IMO three to four and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bran, he had a bunch of weevils that
had gotten into the bran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he inoculated it with this weevil
bran, infected bran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened is the weevils got,
or flea beetles or whatever it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: in there got infected with the fungi from
the IMO that like to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the wild equivalent of a
Baryobaciana or Aceria fumiciraceae that,
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is, Cordyceps fumiciraceae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think they just changed the name of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always changing the name of the
bio controls just to confuse the crap out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pest control people, I swear to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, that they look like little
popcorn kernels because they were covered
[SPEAKER_00]: in fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was like, Hey, this works really
good on the macadamia nut trees for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting rid of the weevils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had kind of been screwing
around with it, but I haven't had anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: to really test it on like a bigger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went ahead and we paid a bunch of
the kids like a nickel for every 10 or 20
[SPEAKER_00]: grasshoppers they could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had all the little village kids
running around getting all the
[SPEAKER_00]: grasshoppers they could into buckets for
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took that and we did a bunch of IMO
collections with IPMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the recipe for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something I think anybody doing
gardening should really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: adopt this practice because it's really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works on a really wide range of
insects, grasshoppers, blister beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: Japanese beetles, leafhoppers,
stink bugs, like a lot of stuff that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard to treat normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Caterpillars and butterflies works really
good on these guys too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will kill your bees though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you spray them directly with it,
it will infect them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't take out your hive,
but if you spray them and directly apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it onto the bees, it will kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure that maybe you apply
them in the evening when the bees have
[SPEAKER_00]: already roosted, if you are keeping bees
at home just to be on the safe side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a precaution on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're familiar with IMO and we'll
go through it and assume that you aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you're gonna weigh about 700 grams
of rice and put that into a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, you're gonna take 300 grams of your
locally collected insects or purchased
[SPEAKER_00]: insect frass or go to your local pet shop
or farm store and buy mealworms or
[SPEAKER_00]: crickets or some other local insect dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or take a light bulb and put it above a
bucket outside and just let all the local
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs fall into it, strain that and just
try to get about 300 grams of insect frass
[SPEAKER_00]: or bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alternatively, you can use crab meal or
lobster meal if you have to, if you're in
[SPEAKER_00]: a pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, you're gonna mix those two together
until you have a nice insect infused rice
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna cook that together
combined in a pot until it's about 80 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 85% finished with the rice, till it's a
little bit stiff still but not totally
[SPEAKER_00]: soft yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna take that finished
cooked mix and you're gonna put it into an
[SPEAKER_00]: open weave basket that has a lot of holes
in it and air can flow through it really
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna put a good four or five
inches layer in the bottom of that basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna take a piece of open
screen and it doesn't matter any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: screen will work or you can even just take
a piece of string and weave it across the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to make a cover for it that
air can pass through but you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: let the local dogs or cats or squirrels or
whatever else forest creatures into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now you have your basket that has
a little screen on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're gonna take your basket full of
your starter and you're gonna put that out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the forest or a part of your property
that has a lot of duff or leaf litter or
[SPEAKER_00]: an area where it's kind of naturally
composting like you would in a forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older the area, the healthier the
area, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a good 10 to 20 collections
at a time when I do this because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: combine all of them and kind of get the
different microbial colonies from around
[SPEAKER_00]: the different area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna set that basket out into your
forested area and then you're gonna put a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not directly on top of the basket but a
good foot and a half, two feet above it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna put a plastic bag or an old
dog food bag or a trash bag, whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps the rain from falling onto
the rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rice doesn't get any more wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just wanna have it kind of like damp
but not soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're gonna look around the forest
and see if you can find any pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: branches or anything that have a little
mycorrhizae on it and just drop two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three of those or four or five if you want
to into the top of your basket just
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath the screen so that you do have
a little bit of an inoculant going on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what's gonna happen is you're gonna
leave it out there for five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe six if it's a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's really hot, you can sometimes get
away with four days but usually five to
[SPEAKER_00]: six days is what it takes to do the
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what happens is you're collecting the
natural fungi that feed on the rice but
[SPEAKER_00]: also that feed on the insect corpses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the chitin-feeding fungi that
feed on the insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of capturing all the local
equivalents of Bavaria bastiana and Ciceri
[SPEAKER_00]: fiume ciraceae and all these other
biocontrols that you're making at home but
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gathering whatever the local
species is from your particular property
[SPEAKER_00]: or your particular region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that when you apply this in your
garden, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminating the ground or worry about
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're worried about if your kid's running
through the garden while you're spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: or if your dog runs by you or if it drinks
from the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can drink this stuff which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now your basket's been out there for
five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your nice solid block of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be white, maybe a little
yellow, maybe a little bit of green in
[SPEAKER_00]: there but for the most part it should be
white or 80% plus white.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna take the basket back and then
you're gonna take all of your different
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal blocks that you have, check them,
make sure they're not all green.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's all green, it's gone to
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now trichoderma is good in some cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a fungal outbreak or
whatever, you can culture that trichoderma
[SPEAKER_00]: and absolutely use that if you have root
rot or some other powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that if you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not trying to collect the
trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichoderma can be a little too aggressive
and it can wipe out a lot of your other
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials if you use too much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's too much green, throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not all green, it's all nice and
white or white and yellow, take that and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna weigh it all and put all the
good collections into a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put out 20 of them, you should get
at least seven or eight of them that are
[SPEAKER_00]: keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get more than that, then great but
don't feel bad if you only get one or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're gonna weigh all of that
collectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just say that we had three
kilograms of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have 3,000 grams that we had saved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're gonna weigh 3,000 grams of brown
sugar and we're gonna combine that and mix
[SPEAKER_00]: it all together and it's gonna stabilize
it by locking out the oxygen with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna basically cause all of
those microbes to go to like a spore form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have a shelf stabilized version
that we can keep indefinitely for use as
[SPEAKER_00]: our store basically shelf stabilized
pesticide that we've just made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we're ready to brew that,
we're gonna take a big scoop full.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're doing a smaller batch,
you can do it a tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a grow tent size, if you're gonna do a
larger grow, we were doing a four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: cups of it to do about 8,000 square feet
of greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put that into a big paint strainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put an air stone or two in there and
you brew it up in your bucket or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: trash can and brew that up for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the IPMO should smell freakishly like
wintergreen when it finishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has this amazing pine wintergreen
smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's the phenols that are in it,
but it comes out this incredible like
[SPEAKER_00]: wintergreen smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if that's universal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been universal with all the different
places I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have a version with your local
biology that doesn't make it happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but every time I've done it, that's what
it smells like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have this all good brew mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically the rewoken up microbes
that you went and collected that feed on
[SPEAKER_00]: chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now when you apply that, you can go
either directly to the root system through
[SPEAKER_00]: your fertigation, just strain it and apply
it right to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also foliar spray it onto the
plants and it works to kill a huge wide
[SPEAKER_00]: range of insects, but also instantly
provides chitinase directly to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because that fungi broke down that chitin
from those insects inside of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're also increasing the SAR response
of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's now boosting its immune system
and its own defenses and you're directly
[SPEAKER_00]: infecting the insects that are on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like a double mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're boosting the plant's ability to
fight the insects and boosting its
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient uptake of calcium at the same
time, which also helps with insect
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also directly infecting the pest
insects, you know, by applying spores
[SPEAKER_00]: directly to their body, which then infect
them and kill them and turns them into
[SPEAKER_00]: little white mummies, which is really,
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it really is the best pesticide that
I've seen or the best innovation I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: in the organic world in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that everybody should be
sharing this recipe with anybody they can
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a completely safe way to make
a pesticide that really kicks the crap out
[SPEAKER_00]: of just a huge range of different insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's completely safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can drink the stuff and it might give
you a stomach ache, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: kill you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to go to the
hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no kind of danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate you sharing that recipe with
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have quite a few folks that take notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got their pen and pad ready and
they're taking notes on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really with this IMO recipe,
natural farming technique, and there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many different natural farming techniques
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, again, thanks for sharing that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you've probably saved quite a few
gardens now in the future here,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you mentioned, that sounds
like it's very strong and very valuable
[SPEAKER_01]: for folks growing in different areas to
kind of prevent pests or tackle pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even had people use it on broad mites
and have success as well, which surprised
[SPEAKER_00]: me because typically things with six legs
or eight legs do not work with fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: biocontrols.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I haven't had that response,
but I've had reports of two different
[SPEAKER_00]: people in Thailand using it to treat
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never know what you're going to
collect and what it's going to work for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it is amazing for
mostly your larger insects across the
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about storage tips and shelf life on
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The oldest one I've had is about a year
and a half old and it was still pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't kept it longer than that just
because it's kind of a newer tech that's
[SPEAKER_00]: only been around really since 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the places we're at,
we've either blown through the whole batch
[SPEAKER_00]: that we made or some other thing where we
just combined it with the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can combine multiple months too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do a collection every month
and then I'll combine this month,
[SPEAKER_00]: last month, and the next month from the
previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I collect it in February,
I'm going to put January and March's
[SPEAKER_00]: collections in the following year's
application and just combine those three
[SPEAKER_00]: when you make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a scoop of this, a scoop of this,
and a scoop of this and that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you the best biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's not that much different
from, you know, who used to do this first
[SPEAKER_00]: was the Vikings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would take the best soil from the end
of the growth season or the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: right before harvest, put it into empty
ram's horns and seal them with wax and
[SPEAKER_00]: then bury them below the frost line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the spring would come and
the ground would thaw, they would dig
[SPEAKER_00]: those up and spread them back out on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they thought they were like putting
the garden spirits back onto the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, what they were doing is just
inoculating it with microbes that were
[SPEAKER_00]: kept below the frost line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now they're kind of just
re-inoculating the garden with the best
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes from the previous year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had the same kind of idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a little bit different
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this stuff is really much
older than people realize, or we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing similar practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just kind of refine them, you know,
significantly since their inception.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting into different areas,
I want to get into garden setup and
[SPEAKER_01]: design.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of challenges that can be
faced going from setup area in different
[SPEAKER_01]: countries or even just different areas
across the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: What design challenges have you faced and
kind of pivots that you've had to do
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in some areas versus others?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the biggest one hands down across
the board was power.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Zimbabwe, we had power from Zesa from
11 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: till about 530 to 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the time, the power goes to
the industrial zones and you don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have power, you know,
a generator or solar or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some other way to power up whatever it is
you need to power up that day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a huge part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting up all that infrastructure,
usually solar or generators just to get by
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning and then setting up solar
pumps for long term irrigation is really
[SPEAKER_00]: just almost required once you get into
most of the remote areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, setting them up to drip lines
and then also on a rotation schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like this field gets flooded on
Mondays, this field gets flooded on
[SPEAKER_00]: Tuesdays, this field gets flooded on
Wednesdays and then repeat again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is really, you know, indexing valves would
be another one where we're able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: large volumes of stuff with one or two
pieces of equipment because it's switching
[SPEAKER_00]: between four separate large zones or eight
separate large zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I would say with indexing
valves is that make sure you're checking
[SPEAKER_00]: them daily or almost daily because if one
of those fails, you know, you're losing
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of plants if that breaks and we
had that happen at one facility in Jamaica
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was working with University of
Technology Kingston.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had one that failed and it wiped out,
you know, three of the four rows of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they weren't checking it regularly
on the maintenance once it was set up,
[SPEAKER_00]: the guy just signed off that he checked it
and wasn't actually checking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing is making sure
people are actually doing and finding out
[SPEAKER_00]: like who in your local area is actually
reliable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you can count on, you know,
is another big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the biggest thing too is just drip
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drip lines are the best way to do large
scale, you know, outdoor on any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not going to get any of
that evaporative water loss and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty easy to set up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world you can find the drip line
irrigation kits, you know, doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're as far away as Zimbabwe or some
of the other areas that maybe don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: quite as much income in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find drip line kits at an
industrial scale pretty cheaply anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next thing would be properly
sourcing fertilizers and pesticides in
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the rest of the world is a lesson
in insanity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to hunt and pack and often
just import them from local countries
[SPEAKER_00]: nearby, you know, in the case of Zimbabwe
we had to import everything from Kenya or
[SPEAKER_00]: Zimbabwe or South Africa because they're
the only two places that have bio controls
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can get either beneficial insects
or, you know, all your standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things like Bavaria baciana and
so on and so forth aren't really that much
[SPEAKER_00]: into the rest of the world yet with the
exception of Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand was an exception where Thailand
actually has a bunch of bio controls that
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't even have here yet that I wish we
I wish I had we have a 10 in one which is
[SPEAKER_00]: like our five in one that's female a
terrace and very bossy on a seraphimus
[SPEAKER_00]: trace a metarysium and another one all
combined into one and one application not
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff kicks but like that's like you're
especially for thrips that like nukes the
[SPEAKER_00]: crap out of your thrips and it just wipes
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really a good saving grace
for us for thrips.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's another thing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do combined bio controls,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't they can't legally sell a
product that has the very bossy on a and
[SPEAKER_00]: metarysium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a combined application,
they have to all be individual active
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients because of the pest control
laws in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in Thailand, you can have two,
three, four, five bio controls and one
[SPEAKER_00]: separate powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in the water and mix it up and
run with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be another big thing that's
different is that sometimes at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southeast Asia, it's a little easier for
the pesticide stuff to find what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, in Zimbabwe, you could buy
paraquat at the hardware store and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting right next to the ammonium nitrate
and the barrels of peroxide, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is not a very good place to
store all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not in the open where people are
smoking cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, you know, you see some stuff
where you're like, oh, my brain hurts and
[SPEAKER_00]: I shouldn't be anywhere near this place
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that that's honestly the
probably the biggest challenge power and
[SPEAKER_00]: then sourcing stuff can be just if you
aren't used to and the hardest part of
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing is just finding whatever the
local thing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in Zimbabwe, it's Shopee and Lazada
and Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of whatever ag website that you
can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that a lot of it is just spending hours
searching for all your list of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have your list of equipment as
far as sourcing and finding someone that
[SPEAKER_00]: can deliver it within a reasonable time to
that could be another big problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get deeper into genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit more here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about modern techniques,
genetic engineering, selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What role does that play in shaping the
genetic diversity of plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as far as selective breeding,
I mean, I think that's one of the reasons
[SPEAKER_00]: why the United States is kind of the king
of the medical plant world is because we,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fought the man one closet at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we had at any one point,
you know, 60 to 80,000 different breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: programs going in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: that anyone or more right to supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always was comical to me when you
hear some of these big MSO and corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: guys going, well, there's not enough small
producers around to supply the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you think supplied the country?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last 80 years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's a comical thing to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think but that's why you have,
you know, the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is the leader on that genetically is
because we did have so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: unique programs and every single breeder
had a different thing in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one was chasing something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some had a medical problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were chasing hype stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some were chasing stuff that looked good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some just happened to get lucky and find a
gem in the rough and ran with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's plenty of stories with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Gorilla Glue was was an accident
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's plenty of others out
there that, you know, were just something
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally got pollinated and ended up
producing a gem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's even lots of stuff
that was accidental and people didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really the biggest thing
that's driving now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, you have a lot of this genetic
marker assisted stuff and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's definitely some
companies not that long ago that were
[SPEAKER_00]: screaming about was it new outrageous new
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny how the company that said that
the CEO got fired and we've yet to see any
[SPEAKER_00]: of those outrageous new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that GW Pharma has a few
genetically patented strains that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: never released to the public that they're
internal that I've heard from talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan Russo.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's not a lot of people doing the
GMO stuff yet, at least not publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, too,
a lot of the market does not want GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 80 percent of the campus market are
people that already don't like GMOs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a why would you make
something for a for a market that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want that thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly some on a large scale
commercial side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think things like triploids or GMO stuff
that's not going to be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated is cool when you just want to
grow a field for biomass and not have any
[SPEAKER_00]: males or have your neighbor be able to do
his own breeding program and not screw up
[SPEAKER_00]: your stuff or have hemp growing,
seed hemp or fiber hemp where they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling mails and then you don't have to
worry about it for your home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's not home grow, but like for
your other nearby commercial grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is viability for that type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But personally, I'm not I'm not for GMOs
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also think that there's a potential to
with auto flowers being kind of used in
[SPEAKER_00]: that way with and I've talked about this a
long time ago with autos being used to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of control the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have triploids and autos being like the
vast majority of what's available to home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to buy each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have federal legalization,
it means the feds can get their tax money
[SPEAKER_00]: each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could see them doing some kind of law
where and again, this is being doomsday
[SPEAKER_00]: ish, but where the feds require those to
be the only seed sold so that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: control the market, which you know,
that would piss a lot of people off,
[SPEAKER_00]: including me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that is scummy enough I
could see them trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I didn't give them any ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The triploids generally are kind of
against that, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I know a lot of great strains of
triploids, but I mean, at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, if you're selling seeds and people
can't breed with them, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of ending the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're a lot of us that are in
the community happen to and a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders, what are breeders supposed to
work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're a new breeder,
just getting into the game, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not somebody that's been around for
a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have 2000 plus different
cultivars in your selection like I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a lot of other people do that have been
doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how are you supposed to build a
pool of genetics to start working with to
[SPEAKER_00]: have the colors you need to paint your
picture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to have some different stuff
that you can go, oh, I like the trade from
[SPEAKER_00]: this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the trade in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bet they'd be even better if I combine
them this way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's what all of us have
experienced when we're doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by closing that door, it takes away a
lot of the fun of actually just growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, again, it's great for commercial
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it definitely has a place in the
market, but I wouldn't buy a 10 pack,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hands on the Donuts Triploid by
Humboldt and I haven't planted them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to plant them and try them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what happens there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, from what I'm hearing,
it seems like there's more, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: if I should even say this, but it seems
like more cons than pros.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's never going to kind of
overrun the whole market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like FEMs are always going to be
the most popular, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, the traditional homegrown is
just going to want FEM and they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to want to be able to create their own
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't really do that with
Triploid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't foresee Triploid's kind of
overrunning everything and then like regs
[SPEAKER_01]: and FEMs kind of being outdated or
obsolete.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of coming onto the scene here
and it's becoming pretty popular out of
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: My other question is, is that what are the
negative impacts of that Triploid genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like does it make it weaker to PM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make it weaker to some
environmental factor or insect that
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly, you know, because of that
mutation, it's not able to express
[SPEAKER_00]: something that it needs to defend itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's another thing I always think
about with this is you might make a great
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but if, you know, you breathe on it
wrong and it gets botrytis, it's not that
[SPEAKER_00]: great of a plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the other stuff I worry about
is, you know, a lot of this polyhyrid
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, the moment I take it and put it
outside, just gets wrecked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of the super, super polyhybrid
stuff did not do well in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just got mulled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when we're growing in the rice
paddies, it needs to have some level of
[SPEAKER_00]: mold resistance or it's just going to not
do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you can solve a lot of that
with things like IMO applications and
[SPEAKER_00]: boosting the plants, but that only works
so far where before, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just nature is going to take its course
too, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's not really surprising in a
way, because yeah, I mean, this whole
[SPEAKER_01]: episode has really been about growing
plants in different areas and that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good example of a plant that doesn't grow
well, grows well in one area, but doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: grow well in another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, think of it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why do you have different genetic
cultivars in different regions?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the genes are being triggered
in the plant's immune system to defend
[SPEAKER_00]: itself for those different things that
increase those different secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites that we call flavonoids and
terpenes and other compounds in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if those genes aren't being expressed
over and over again in an indoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: where they kept sterilized, especially if
it's like a rockwool grow where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all super sterilized, how are those genes
going to get activated?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see like hydro rockwool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to get above three percent
terpenes for most people unless you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing microbial inoculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take those same cultivars,
drop them in living soil or aquaponics and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have that gene activation of all
those different microbes, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to hit, you know, four, five,
six percent terpenes on those,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same exact cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because those genes are being turned on
suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the number one reason why you
need to get microbial biodiversity in your
[SPEAKER_00]: root system is to turn those genes on and
get that terpene expression on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to boost not only the plant's
immune system, but also, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your yields and the potency of your
medicinal crops or even your lettuce and
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to have good flavor in
your lettuce and tomatoes or cucumbers or
[SPEAKER_00]: eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better have a good biological
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why, for instance, a living soil
lettuce out of your backyard tastes better
[SPEAKER_00]: than the high Joe crap at the grocery
store because all those genes are being
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on inside the plant that make those
flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without that, you don't have that gene
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why if you continually breed
something in a sterile environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to lose the ability to turn
those genes on because why is it going to
[SPEAKER_00]: waste the energy to make those compounds
anymore or to even try to turn those genes
[SPEAKER_00]: on when it never has to do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither did its grandparents or its
great grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a long term evolutionary lineage
where it's not having to deal with that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of makes for weaker strains
that are especially powdery mildew seems
[SPEAKER_00]: to be like the number one thing that these
ultra poly hybrids seem to be just really
[SPEAKER_00]: weak to when you put them outdoors or,
you know, certain insect stuff there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to because again, there's no
immune system to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people kind of forget that part of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really good points there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of reminds me of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people talk about genetic drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about what genetic drift is
and how it really impacted plants these
[SPEAKER_01]: days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetic drift would be either from
super hybridizing something, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with itself or having just really old
moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, remember that the plants kind of
constantly producing new tissue and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: again, constantly turning those immune
system genes off and on like we just
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have the mom that's grown in one
kind of condition and then the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are much more different,
it's going to have a hard time with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, too, as plants age, they're
going to have some genetic mutation just
[SPEAKER_00]: from the fact that the plants just living
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing that people forget with
this has some issues, too, when you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: it too long, because it wants to save its
local genetic population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to try to hermaphrodite on
you once it hits a certain age,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's built into the genes of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same reason why like root bound plants
will trigger for the same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because in the wild, right, you have a
plant and it grows and grows and grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get pollinated, doesn't get
pollinated, doesn't get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it gets a cold snap or get some
kind of like weather condition that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to potentially kill the plant in the
near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to immediately try to produce
that female pollen so we can produce
[SPEAKER_00]: female plants so that it can die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next year, its daughters can come back
and try to be pollinated by outside
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics to preserve that local
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants evolved to do that when it
evolved in the steps of of Mongolia and
[SPEAKER_00]: Tibet, which is where it's from
originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It evolved that mechanism so that didn't
go extinct in its local region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about evolutionary,
that makes a lot of sense for it to
[SPEAKER_00]: function that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And evolutionarily, that's a big
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're trying to veg it and keep
it from flipping, that's a problem
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, there is a maximum life
on the plants, usually about a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half, two years where they're just going
to start to get real weird on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those genes for that final end
of life thing are starting to turn on
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's been alive too long or maybe
stressed it out too much or it's root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound after that or whatever the pressure
point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that something is going to eventually
trigger those genes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't restart it and take new
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you clone it, that clone is not
going to be exactly the same as that
[SPEAKER_00]: mother was.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be close, but it's going to
have a few mutations that are different or
[SPEAKER_00]: a few adaptations, phenotypic adaptations
that are going to be slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: from that mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, those start to build up and
cause issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I see a lot and really old
ones and people often attribute to genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: drift, but usually it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually viral infection is,
you know, particularly mosaic virus and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these other others where if the
plant is healthy, it's not going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of negative impact, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's getting all of its needs
and the immune system is kept healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as the plant gets older and older,
it's less able to fight that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get this gradual increase in viral
load until it hits that critical point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's expressing in the leaves
suddenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see this sometimes too with HLVD.
[SPEAKER_00]: HLVD in many cultivars will perfectly be
fine if it's only detectable in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to affect the yields of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, Kevin McKernan has a wonderful
white paper on this specific problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: whereas if the plant gets aged and that
viral load gets up and up and up,
[SPEAKER_00]: now it's going to start to cause that leaf
mutation and the upper part plant mutation
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how like, for instance,
the hop industry has slowly gotten rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: HLVD was they didn't ever got rid of HLVD
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they did was they got rid of all the
cultivars that actually have problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can remain latent in the plant,
but not have yield effects or negative
[SPEAKER_00]: yield impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the industry is going to have to stop
with this idea that they're ever going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be latent in cucumbers and tomatoes
and corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get rid of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's pollen spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have a leaf hopper go bite
the guy's corn and then re-effect your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you just spent all this lab
work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an impossible task.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hops industry would have eliminated it
a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent 200 years on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they still haven't figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beer guys have as much money as the
medicinal plant growers do in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: investment to protect their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if companies like Unibrew can't
solve this, we're not going to do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: magically different overnight that's going
to suddenly do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another big issue where I can
go into most grow rooms and find at least
[SPEAKER_00]: one or two viral infected plants where
people don't even realize it, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: mosaic virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I've seen a lot in the last couple
years on outdoor plants be leaf pro virus
[SPEAKER_00]: or beam leaf pro virus where it causes the
really cork screwing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, again, it might not show in the
beginning, but after the plants get six or
[SPEAKER_00]: eight months, suddenly it starts to rage
out because that viral load has just hit
[SPEAKER_00]: that critical point where now it's going
to express in the leaf tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another one where you don't see
as much when you have big genetic gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pool diversities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have as much problems,
whereas with the small polyhybrid stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, viruses, viroids, that's a whole
nother topic on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could do a whole episode on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I only imagine how many home grows
are impacted without the actual grower
[SPEAKER_01]: even knowing that they're impacted by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it's a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, it's actually a virus or a viroid
that's causing harm to their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just treading on water,
basically trying to keep their head above
[SPEAKER_01]: water for that grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure there's going to be a lot
more information coming out in the future
[SPEAKER_01]: in regards to that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have a follow-up question in regards
to the mother plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you touched upon how over time these
plants are going to be more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: herm, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping mother plants around,
I think you mentioned one and a half to
[SPEAKER_01]: two years to keep the mother plant around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the longest that you suggest
keeping mother plants around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, ideally if you can swap them every
six months to a year and restart them,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, the longest I would try
to keep something would be about a year
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half to two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, the likelihood of you not
having problems is pretty low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have some kind of issue at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also size.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing something that long,
even if you're hacking the crap out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: every 10 days, it's going to be a huge
structure to it at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gets unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pain to take new cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get on a ladder and it's just not
safe, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you get to bigger time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just working on that many hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have an accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's much better to just restart them
before they get too large from a safety
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint, but also from just a genetic
drift standpoint, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: those issues with the plants that are too
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're talking restart from seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not saying grow the mother plant
for two years, take a clone from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then that clone is your new mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that as long as you kept them
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the reasons why you end up having
problems, biggest ones is being root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound, heat stress or infection or insect
damage, any kind of light leaks or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you don't have those types of
things, you can kind of get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: rebooting them for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you can only do that once or twice
though before you're going to still,
[SPEAKER_00]: plants can have a maximum age before it's
just, again, going to start having
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get, as genetics, the plant's
not designed to live that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of doing a bunch of stuff
where it starts to make errors and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: copies when it's making new tissue and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same way that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why humans get cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to have errors in our system as
we get older.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why older people have more than
younger people.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, it's the same kind of
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other tips do you have for growing
genetics in different climates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one thing would just be narrow
leafs and hot climates and wider leafs and
[SPEAKER_00]: colder climates would be kind of the
baseline for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to grow anything super polyhybrid
in an outdoor environment, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you do, don't count your farm on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the first year that Runts came out,
I watched people plant and then seen them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of that in Oklahoma, and I don't know
a single person aside from us that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually harvested it because all of it
rotted.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow a really dense
flowered structured plant somewhere where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's high humidity, good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: You better put a heck of a probiotic
regimen on that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have major issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really is a huge factor when you're
choosing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow something that's more open and airy
with less of a tight structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's larger and branchier in
those more humid environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure you're using IMO and IPMO for
your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply doing the lactobacillus IMO and
IPMO from pure natural farming or any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of large scale outdoor is going to make
your life so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are going to be much more
naturally resistant to a wide range of
[SPEAKER_00]: different pests and pathogen issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is going to be your best way to
kind of make things go as smooth as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine growing anything at scale
anymore without different natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies just because of how much of
a good job it does at preventing petritis,
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew, and a lot of the other
heavier insect problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sceptoria would be another one where I've
seen people have huge fields of Sceptoria
[SPEAKER_00]: and wipe them out, but I've also saved a
lot of them too by treating the
[SPEAKER_00]: lactobacillus and then IMO inoculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a store bought product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go to treat Sceptoria easily,
especially once that plant's heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: infected, that's going to reverse that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can treat it with trichoderma or some
of the other ones if you catch it early
[SPEAKER_00]: on, but traditionally the agricultural
industry will tell you to throw that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: away even.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can treat that in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of stuff where the natural
solution actually works much better than
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start to learn some of that
stuff, your life will get a lot easier
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to especially the bigger
scale stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even at the home scale for tent growers,
it's just going to make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to go buy those expensive inputs at
the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can at least get half or two thirds of
your pest control stuff just from your own
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really, really good tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, this whole talk has really opened up
my mind quite a bit and made me realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that the amount of knowledge I have
compared to what you can learn growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas, it's pretty much endless.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're all going to be learning
about this plant for the rest of our
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always more to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's things that we haven't uncovered
yet and it makes things so exciting and so
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and is there anything upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.

Cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the board of Copy Left Cultivars as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really awesome new natural
farming AI bot that we're releasing as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check that out on any other

[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you want to listen to more of Mr.
Growett and I, he was over on my show the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day, so not too long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to check it out and listen to the
reverse where I interviewed him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, though, if you enjoyed this

so folks can easily get to your channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let us know any questions that you
have down in the comments section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to read through the questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we get enough questions, maybe we can
get another episode with you to come on
[SPEAKER_01]: here and answer some of those questions
because you have a lot of real in-depth
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just on genetic diversity,
growing plants in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, I mean, we had that episode on
aquaponics, which was just loaded with
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You grow organically, do a lot of natural
farming, so there's so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas we can go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely leave your questions down in
the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stephen, thank you so much again for
coming on.
