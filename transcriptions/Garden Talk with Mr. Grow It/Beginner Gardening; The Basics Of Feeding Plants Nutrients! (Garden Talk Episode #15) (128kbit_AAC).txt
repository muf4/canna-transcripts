[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't ever go by what the bottle says.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much every line that I have run,
I've basically started off with a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: to a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm transplanting, I basically
just do my bottom layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then where I'm going to transplant in,
I just sprinkle the azos and the micos
[SPEAKER_01]: right on top of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to even use very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just look at your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they droopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they show signs of deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they nice and green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have spots on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they yellowing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your research on what your plants look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're spotting something that doesn't
look normal, research it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel that don't on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It,
and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Painted Lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know her from the Michigan
Bros Grow Show or her Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: where she shows off her garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been gardening various plants
outdoors her entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could say her family raised her as
a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we have a beginner
friendly discussion on the basics of
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has experienced using several
different bottle lines of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and she talks about her experience using
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also gives some great tips for success
when it comes to feeding.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the episode,
I'd like to give a quick shout out to our
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor for this episode, Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro sent me over their new LED grow
light, the FCE6500.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow light is a bar style design
that's similar to the FCE6500,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: This FCE6500 has six light bars that are
detachable and movable on the light frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows you to change the light
intensity and distribution across the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 3,900 178 bridge lux chips and a
mosso driver that is dimmable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls 650 watts from the wall and
covers a five foot by five foot grow space
[SPEAKER_00]: for bloom and a six foot by six foot grow
space for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FCE6500 also pulls 650 watts and has
the same coverage area, but it comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: eight light bars that are attached to the
frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light has 2,688 Samsung
LM301 and Osram 660 nanometer chips and a
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmable Inventronics driver.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Painted lady, welcome to Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually saw your interview recently
with Photosyntec and really good
[SPEAKER_00]: interview.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about a ton of good
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get to learn more about you.
[SPEAKER_00]: After hearing that, I'm like, I got to get
her on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get her on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for checking it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really stoked to have him reach out
to me and it was a fun podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you saw it because I
followed you for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know who you are,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm born and raised in Michigan and I've
always been a gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom kind of just ingrained that in me
as a little child.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of my punishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go out and weed the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that wasn't a punishment for me
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been a gardener and I started
growing medicinal plants about five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six years ago and I just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just become my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm from Michigan and it gets
cold here in the winter and it is so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Michigan and I do have patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want to make sure that I have the
best possible product for my patients and
[SPEAKER_01]: going down there and spending time in my
garden, especially in the winter and the
[SPEAKER_01]: nice warm place to go with artificial sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my happy place and spending time down
there just makes my plants happy too and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think it shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found medicinal plants at an early age
because of chronic migraines and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: have really been a proponent of it ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just has been something that I've been
looking at doing professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit about me and I can now
be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys from Michigan Bros Grow Show
found me somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a fan and I would watch and
participate in the chats when they would
[SPEAKER_01]: have their live shows and they asked me to
join the panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm on the Michigan Bros Grow Show
on Sunday and Monday nights and asking
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and answering questions as best
I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been fun and I can't even
begin to tell you how beneficial it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The gardening and everything about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been fantastic and I can't wait to
keep doing this and hope to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: professionally sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things in that podcast that
really stuck out to me is that you've used
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of different types of
nutrients that kind of prompted this
[SPEAKER_00]: interview here or discussion, whatever,
to talk about what the topic is today,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the basics of feeding plants
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different types of
nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's synthetic and there's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might look at the title of
this video, which is the basics of feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: plants nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might say, feed the soil,
not feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually such thing as feeding
the plant and there's actually such thing
[SPEAKER_00]: as feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we talk about synthetic versus
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic nutrients, most bottle lines,
I believe, are synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're smaller molecules and basically
when you're mixing those nutrients into
[SPEAKER_00]: water, they're water soluble, they're in a
plant available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can immediately uptake those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're feeding the plant in that sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic, on the other hand, organic
inputs, organic amendments, that's not in
[SPEAKER_00]: a form that's immediately available for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What needs to happen first is the
microbial life in the soil needs to break
[SPEAKER_00]: down those inputs and put them into that
plant available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll break down or they'll eat those
amendments, crap them out, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in that plant available form that
can be uptaken by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of a delay,
I guess you can say, is the synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients are immediately available for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can uptake it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're coming across a deficiency,
there's going to be a quicker recovery off
[SPEAKER_00]: of synthetic nutrients than organics
because organics needs to be broken down
[SPEAKER_00]: by those microbes first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeding the plant versus feeding the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've grown with synthetic
nutrients in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you also grow with organic nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of bridging the gap right now of
the two because I was originally shown and
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned with synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off with Foxfarm, which I think
we've probably, if you've ever run
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic nutrients, pretty much
everybody's either heard of it or run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just learned with bottled synthetic
newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kind of run the whole gamut,
I guess you could say, between Foxfarm and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I moved to GH and Veg Bloom in
advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought all those bottles, the whole
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I had to have all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make sure that my plant was getting
everything that it needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found that you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of wanted to understand what I was
actually feeding my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in that bottle of Foxfarm Tiger
Bloom that I'm going to be giving to my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I kind of switched over to
organic and wanted to understand exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: like you were saying, feeding the soil
instead of feeding the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a completely different
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying, deficiencies you
can't just solve overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little bit difficult for me to
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing that with the synthetic line,
I can just grab that little bottle of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen or whatever if it's lacking
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within 24 hours, 48 hours, we're good to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really been enjoying learning more
about organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feeding the soil and what I need to do
to keep my plants happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say with me, I've used synthetics for,
I think I used Foxfarm Trio for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: six years of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six years of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started venturing out into other
lines and now eventually worked my way
[SPEAKER_00]: into the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of us kind of do have experience
growing a bunch of different, using a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of different bottled lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into those different bottled
lines that we've used and kind of tips on
[SPEAKER_00]: using those different bottled lines,
let's talk about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pH, PPM, and EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of water do you typically use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use tap water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use well water, RO, rainwater?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am straight tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming right out of the tap here in
my city in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run about, yes I do check pH and EC for
sure when I'm running synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely need to know what you're
giving your plant and what your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: giving back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I definitely check pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my water here is not too horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It runs usually around an eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not terrible, but it's not great
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely have to make sure I adjust
after I add my nudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you find with the bottled
nutrient lines, they kind of adjust
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're somehow regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe me, I'm not a scientist,
so I don't know how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But however it works, sometimes after you
add all of what you need to add to give
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant what it needs, it kind of
balances that pH for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But always check to make sure because you
want to make sure that your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the right amount of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way that you can do that is
by having the correct pH going in and
[SPEAKER_01]: going out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I definitely check all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just use straight tap water,
pH it, and check the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC usually I run I usually do PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's kind of, most people have a
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do PPMs and I usually do about a
three to six in early veg, three to 600
[SPEAKER_01]: PPMs early veg and a 600 to 900 mid to
late veg and then bump it up from there
[SPEAKER_01]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to stay about a 6.2 to 6.5 pH
generally when I'm running a bottled line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for watering, you know, you mentioned
you use tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of tap water comes with either
chlorine or chloramine, which can be
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful for the microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything with the tap water
before you mix your nutrients in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you like let it sit out so the chlorine
dissipates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you even have chlorine or chloramine
in your local water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ours, I have checked it and it doesn't
seem to be too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right straight out of the tap,
it's coming out at about 200 to 250 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't worry too much about adding
extra to the water or letting it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of let my plants tell me how they
feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if my plants look happy with the
system that I'm using now, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: generally not waiting or adding anything
to my tap water, then I tend to just leave
[SPEAKER_01]: it as it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my plants look happy, then I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something to keep in mind when
you're using these bottled nutrients is
[SPEAKER_00]: what your PPM is coming out of the tap,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM or EC is coming out of the tap because
the nutrients you mix up is going to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition to that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your feeding chart says 500 PPM is
this mixture, grow A, grow B, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to be on top of what is
coming out of your tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually in my local area, we have
chlorine and it actually comes out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tap at like 485 PPM, which is extremely
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think EPA guidelines is no higher than
500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if it's over 500, it's unsafe to
drink or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mine's very, very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at my local water report
and they do have a breakdown of what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was pretty surprised to see that of
the 485 PPM, 80 PPM is sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually when I used, I did a grow with
tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done several grows with tap water
over the years, but one in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a grow with tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got a soil sample from Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my sodium level was through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know, Logan Labs
does soil samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think genuinely it's recommended to do a
soil sample between grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may advise differently on that one,
but there are consultants out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can sit down and look over your soil
sample with, and they'll give you guidance
[SPEAKER_00]: on what amendments you need to add or
whatever to kind of rebalance that soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I was really surprised with 80
PPM of sodium and that there was such a
[SPEAKER_00]: buildup there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that folks should
certainly be aware of when they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I definitely did not consider that
when I first started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't even thinking about it until I
think I saw one, somebody's video,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the YouTube videos that I might've
even been you actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and I didn't even think about,
oh my gosh, I gotta add that number to the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual end result to make sure I'm getting
the right amount of PPMs into my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, definitely gotta keep an eye on
all that stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about pH, you talked about
what your ideal range is, talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM, what your ideal ranges are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about top feeding versus
bottom feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditional way to feed your plants is to
mix up nutrients, maybe put in a pitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: or spray or something and then feed on the
top, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a soil drench from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard on your, on that interview with
Photosyntec that you do bottom feeding in
[SPEAKER_00]: here, what you like to call butt check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Butt chugging.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked to us a little bit about bottom
feeding versus top feeding and some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a regular podcast, the Michigan bros
grow show and we, they kind of have shown
[SPEAKER_01]: me the way as we call it, butt chugging
with bottom watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always a top water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always just filled up a bucket,
added my nutrients and just poured it
[SPEAKER_01]: right over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like I do with my plants outside in
my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just never really, thought about
bottom watering or the benefits of why you
[SPEAKER_01]: would want a bottom water as opposed to
just pouring it right over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found there's so many benefits to
quote unquote butt chugging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that that's a term that a lot
of people in the industry either love or
[SPEAKER_01]: hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either giggle or you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just giggle at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, it's just something
that a term that we like to use and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of, just kind of gives us a
little bit extra giggle when we're down
[SPEAKER_01]: there watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally I just take the same amount
of water that I would have poured over the
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pour it in the reservoir at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that eliminates a lot of problems that
you can come across with fungus gnats and
[SPEAKER_01]: pests with, you know, having the top layer
of that soil being a little bit damp can
[SPEAKER_01]: cause a little bit of a problem if you've
ever found that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the butt chugging just really seems to
eliminate that problem altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it just, also it's just so
much, a lot of people call it the lazy
[SPEAKER_01]: man's way of watering too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever used radical
bags or fabric bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times if you pour that water
right over the top, it can run right off
[SPEAKER_01]: the sides, especially in those radical
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bottom, bottom watering,
the butt chugging sure eliminates that
[SPEAKER_01]: problem all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your nutrients aren't going right off
the side and into on the floor or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: in the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's, I just have really become
a fan of bottom watering for, for both of
[SPEAKER_01]: those reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start talking about these bottle
lines now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we actually get into each bottle
line individually, there's a question I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first started getting,
I think I was on Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was growing with that for six years,
like I mentioned, and I was just starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to venture out into new lines and I asked
growers with more experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may, you know, which line should I
try?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I try this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I try this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one looks good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the general consensus among a lot of
these growers with experience with several
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle lines, I was a little bit surprised
on this is that they're saying a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these lines are very, very similar to the
point where you should just pick one and
[SPEAKER_00]: go with it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mostly synthetic lines are going
to have base nutrients and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have additives on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So base nutrients typically consists of
two, maybe three bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, I know blue planet nutrients has
a blue max part, uh, a part B Fox farm has
[SPEAKER_00]: the Fox farm trio, three bottles of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are several lines out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have either two bottles or three
bottles of their base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have additives beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, would you agree or
disagree with these lines being very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar to ways you just kind of pick one
and go with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, I didn't find that they
were similar at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just, the, the Fox farm may be a
little similar to the GH I thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, but once I switched over to veg bloom
and having the powder new, it's as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to the bottles that we had that was
completely new for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the advanced nutrients just seemed
to separate every single thing out into a
[SPEAKER_01]: different bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, obviously for certain
purposes, but, um, yeah, I found that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that they all had a different
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they all had a different result in
my experience in my environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, that's why I chose to kind of
experiment throughout the different lines
[SPEAKER_01]: because I wanted to see the differences in
what it would bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this one would bring a different
flavor or more turps than this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I tend to think that they
all have their own advantages and
[SPEAKER_01]: disadvantages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I've really found my niche now
with, it's not really, it's not synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an organic bottled nutrient with
bloom yellow bottles, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: Australian company who I found through
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I obviously used to watch your videos
when I was first starting out religiously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one time you chose to use the bloom
yellow bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe they sent you a sample or
something and, and your girls were loving
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I paid attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I was, uh, at a local girl
store, I found that they had, they had a
[SPEAKER_01]: little expo and the guy from bloom yellow
bottles was there and sent me home with a
[SPEAKER_01]: sample of the whole line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is organic, but it is bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I just, my plants in my
environment just really, really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have stuck with them ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that you've gotten
success off of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I definitely, I like to use
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't too, too happy about the amount
of bottles that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have like 18 different
bottles total when you talk about their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their foliar sprays and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, but yeah, again, I think you can
get away with just the grow A and the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think they have one grow A,
grow B for veg, grow A and B for flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do you use just those or what other,
um, bottles do you use from bloom yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have any tips for using bloom
yellow bottles?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I do use quite a few, but I have found
that you can really narrow it down to just
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, like you said, the bases,
the A and Bs and in veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really think that the plants benefit
from, uh, the humates, humates,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they have a sea minerals line.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a seaweed, uh, sea fuel and sea
minerals that I think have really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, uh, made a difference in the
plants and their health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, those are the main ones,
aside from their other product,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a roots product, obviously,
um, you know, that, that helps,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, create your rise of fear and
make sure that everything is getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the microbes are doing their job to
make sure the plant can uptake those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that you're feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you follow their feeding schedule
that they put in place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they put out on their website?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if so, do you do the full dose
like they recommend or do you do a half
[SPEAKER_00]: dose or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any of us synthetic growers
or bottle newts growers ever actually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I always probably start with either a
quarter to a half of what they recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bottle just to make sure I don't
want to burn my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can always, oh, you can always
correct it, but you can't take away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're feeding right out of the
gate, what they're recommending,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes your plants may not be used to
it at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I generally try to get away with less
is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I do, I just generally try to take a
look at my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they showing any kind of deficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are, that's when you can correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally I take the less is more
approach and that seems to be working for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you add it to your water,
are you adjusting the P are you looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH then pH PPN?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adjusting the pH then?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you use to adjust the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do, you know, I don't tend to worry
about it too much with the organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with the bloom yellow bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally kind of leave my blue lab pens
to the side until later in flower when I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to make sure, um, everything is,
is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And towards, you know, getting towards the
end, I want to make sure that those,
[SPEAKER_01]: that plan is flush and smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that all that
nutrients are out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, for the most part, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of put the pH pen away with the
bloom yellow bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only when I'm running like a,
you know, a veg bloom or, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: GH or, or one of those lines that I tend
to use them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for the most part,
uh, the bloom yellow bottles seem to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have checked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, after adding just to see,
just to make sure that I'm not crazy out
[SPEAKER_01]: of whack and it seems to kind of settle
around an acceptable range for my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I generally just don't try to mess with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, like going back to what I
said before, less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why add that acid or, you know,
if you don't have to with the pH up or pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down, it just, you know, those blue and
orange and all this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I just would rather less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would assume.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you said you were coming into like
eight something pH to begin with your tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, I assume after adding those
nutrients, I would assume it would drop
[SPEAKER_00]: into that acceptable range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you add those in,
your microbes actually adjust the pH range
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole organic side of things as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people say that when you're
organics, you don't have to check pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have to check PPM, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool that that that's how
that works out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're doing well with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't, you know, I, I can't say
anything bad about that company or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in a blind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's just really, really worked
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in my environment, I mean,
everybody's environment is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, yeah, you know, I'm a basement
grower here in Michigan with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cement block walls and, and I do have a
pretty nice setup and then I have separate
[SPEAKER_01]: veg and flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to grow in a tent,
which, um, can be trying at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, not growing in a tent because you have
a bigger space to have to try to control
[SPEAKER_01]: that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those yellow bottles just,
I don't know what the, with my,
[SPEAKER_01]: I am an led grower too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under all those LEDs and, and,
you know, the blue and yellow bottles just
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to be really making my girls happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to Fox farm nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about your
experience using Fox farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any tips you have for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was the very first line I ever
used coming out the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mentor was the one that used Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, he showed me the way with that
three part system and I was always,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is and maybe it's
just kind of a mental thing for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't like to eat any foods with
like food color, like massive food,
[SPEAKER_01]: like blue and green and red food coloring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed with Fox farm that I had
kind of these weird colors and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, not that there's anything wrong
with it, but I just would kind of put that
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm kind of thinking, this is kind of
like miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it just really seemed unnatural
to me, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I quickly moved away from Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and all those other lines,
I really wanted to try to kind of get away
[SPEAKER_01]: from, from everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that just didn't seem natural to me,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that makes me not a synthetic
grower now, but now that I've found bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow bottles, but, um, yeah,
I really, the only experience I had with
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox farm was the initial first few runs
and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I found once I switched to the
other lines and especially with the bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow bottles, the flavor and the terpene
profile just seemed to, to explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, nothing against Fox farm or
anybody who uses it, but that was my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of was like, Hmm,
let's try something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, I grew with
first six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew with Fox farm, started with the
trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, overfed my plants at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very, very concentrated line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at their feeding chart and
their PPMs are way out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just so people are aware, maybe,
you know, there's a lot of new growers
[SPEAKER_00]: watching this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at these feeding
charts, understand that the PPMs they
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned are for a wide variety of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people jump to the
assumption that this is for the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, medicinal plants can take
less than what's recommended on the
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you often hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: People doing a half dose, people doing a
quarter dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for me with Fox farm, I would actually
do a third dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do a third, sometimes even a quarter
dose of Fox farm nutrients, their Fox farm
[SPEAKER_00]: trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three bottles that consist of,
and when I was running an HPS,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all I needed was those three
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, uh, you know, pH adjust using pH
up or pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then of course monitor the,
the R, uh, the pH and PPM of the runoff as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, and then kind of make adjustments
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but I had good success with
Fox farm nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually one thing I found is that
once I switched to LED, I started getting
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium deficiency and I was advised to
add in an additive Cal Mag, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that solved the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll talk a little bit about
additives, uh, as we're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: these lines or maybe after we go through
these lines, but Cal Mag was an additive
[SPEAKER_00]: that I added with it, particularly,
particularly when using LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one other thing was I found with
some particular cultivars or phenos was I
[SPEAKER_00]: would see phosphorus deficiency in mid
flowering and I used Beastie blooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a PK booster by Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all my problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add it week four, five,
and six only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that would completely solve my
phosphorus issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you used any other additives at all
or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, um, occasionally I will add,
I do still have a couple of those other
[SPEAKER_01]: lines that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in flower, uh, I don't really add too
many additives in veg, but in flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely add, uh, occasionally some
shine by veg, veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that really adds, uh,
density and some weight, uh, to the
[SPEAKER_01]: product to the end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also like to use new millenniums,
um, product also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm drawn a blank on what the name of
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, um, the frost booster, you know what
I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, winter frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Winter frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I like to add that in flower too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it adds a little bit of,
a little bit of frost to the girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but, and obviously you bloom
yellow bottles does have a calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: additive that I do think is essential,
uh, especially with growing with LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, definitely have to add Cal Mag and
I do add a couple of the little bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: boosters there for, for density and shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when you were using Foxfarm?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but I still use them to this day,
even with my bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, I'll add, I think it adds a little
bit of extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've kind of developed that system on
my own, as opposed to when I was running
[SPEAKER_01]: that Foxfarm system with my mentor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he would add Budswell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even remember the name of the
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it's a Foxfarm company.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would always add Budswell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple other things for the late end
stage flower, um, boost, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as any other additives too much
with the Foxfarm line, that was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to general hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually a line that I've never
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people use it with success.
[SPEAKER_00]: General hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about your
experience using that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know they're feeding chart in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have to do a half dose with
that one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, we pretty much when I, my mentor and I,
he basically told me right out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: gate, don't ever go by what the bottle
says, just do half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much every line that I have run,
I've basically started off with a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: to a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even would do a quarter sometimes cause
I'd be too afraid to burn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say with GH same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always fed them a half and that seemed
to be doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never had a problem with deficiencies
too much with GH or, or anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just didn't think that that Terp
profile was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just, I don't know, it just seemed
to be lacking a little something for me
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe it was my environment or maybe
it was me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was running it when I was
early growing and, and, uh, maybe it was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that was doing wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, as far as, uh, the GH line,
definitely half strength for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they are pretty concentrated and
like Fox farm with GH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you run any additives on top?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it three bottles with GH, the base
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God, this was so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many years ago, I run so many,
you know, advanced had like 20 some
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like, so it's hard for me to
remember, but yeah, I think they were a
[SPEAKER_01]: three parter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we used the same additives with
the Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took his additives that he used
with the Fox farm and tried them with the
[SPEAKER_01]: GH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would add that bud swell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was another one that we used to
use that I think got banned actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't remember what the name of that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was now, but you definitely have to
know what you're feeding your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I want to know what I'm feeding
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, if that stuff's getting
banned, why, why is it getting banned?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might've been a PGR plant growth
regulator, which yeah, which is highly
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, my mentor was all about yield and
I am not, I am about quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was probably was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now getting into advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a line that you had mentioned has
a ton of different bottles there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard nightmare stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have a lot of success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nightmare stories that I hear is just
that I heard that they're overpriced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that, you know, the salespeople
try to sell you all their bottles and you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually need all their bottles and,
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell me a little bit about like
advanced nutrients, you know, the base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that they have, maybe the
additives you used with them, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually loved advanced when I first
started running them as opposed to the Fox
[SPEAKER_01]: farm and, and the GH because they had that
pH perfect system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you added that three part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a, I used the micro grow
and bloom line from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, Mike added that every time
and my, my plants loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I don't have anything bad to say
about that, about them in any way other
[SPEAKER_01]: than they did seem to separate every
single bottle or every single possible
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient out into a separate bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just seemed like they had so
many different lines of the same nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they had three different roots
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was always kind of like,
I don't get it, but okay, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in the end, I kind of thought that
everything tasted the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I would run several different strains
together in the same room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end, it seemed to me that
everything tasted the same and smelled the
[SPEAKER_01]: same and had the same turf profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, maybe this is going back to,
I know the GH or whatever, maybe I did
[SPEAKER_01]: something wrong, but it just, um,
just didn't seem to do it for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I, I wanted something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that there was medicinal plants
that tasted different from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously I wanted to find out how I
could make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I ended up switching from
advanced over to blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found them and wow, what a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a huge difference, but advanced,
it's good company.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of bottles, very expensive,
but they grow good plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have anything bad to say about
them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants were happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit more about their
pH perfect that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be able to correct me if I'm
wrong here, but, uh, from my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding, it's basically once you add
in those nutrients into water,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be in the ideal range of pH
for plants so that you don't have to use
[SPEAKER_00]: pH up and pH down and go, go back and
forth potentially trying to get it into
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular range.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even did check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to use the old school,
you know, the little plastic bottles and
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, check the color with the
drops and everything before I got a blue
[SPEAKER_01]: lab pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, makes things so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, I would check it just to
make sure it just like, this can't
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly, like I just added all of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't possibly, but every time it was
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know the technology,
just the way that they have you running
[SPEAKER_01]: their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously the scientists have put that
together so that they know that this one
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to adjust it to this point so
that, you know, you're feeding the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in that correct range that they can uptake
the nutrients in the way that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it was great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it's great for beginners in
that way, because then you don't have that
[SPEAKER_01]: extra step of, Oh no, you know,
I added my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it in the right range for my plants to
be able to uptake those correctly?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's perfect for beginners in that way,
in that aspect, because you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: mess around with it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely sounds like that would be a
benefit and make things easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I wonder how it would impact like a
half dose of nutrients versus a quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: dose versus if it's still going to adjust
the pH accurately like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also different water sources,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, using tap water,
which you said has like 200 PPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: how does that impact versus all raw water
with, you know, close to zero PPM or
[SPEAKER_00]: distilled water, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that is definitely one of the
lines that I follow the instructions onto
[SPEAKER_01]: because I was concerned about that pH
perfect system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, well, I must have to use
exactly what they indicate on the
[SPEAKER_01]: directions to obtain that pH perfect
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, so I never did really experiment
outside of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have, maybe that's, maybe that
was the problem with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the everything tasting the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm not blaming any of the
companies for, you know, any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: situation that I ended up with,
the result that I ended up with in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that was what I experienced and
maybe it was something I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it wasn't, but I have had other
people say to me, um, the same about
[SPEAKER_01]: advance that they kind of found in the end
that everything kind of tasted and smelled
[SPEAKER_01]: the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my plants were happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, you know, it's all about that end
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the, uh, what is this veg bloom
nutrient you're talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a company?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you also use veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like veg plus bloom, a hydroponic
research I think is the umbrella of veg
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have like a veg bloom dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, it goes, they have their lines
specifically for your water type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have like tap water,
you want to use the dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are using RO water, you want to use
a different line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like, you know,
same thing with, um, bloom yellow bottles
[SPEAKER_01]: has like a European A and B and like it's
so everything is kind of different.
[SPEAKER_01]: With their bases.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, they, and they're
powder newts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a little different for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always used to bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, what switching over to that powder
was definitely a different for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, the plants were happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I kind of didn't like about
the powder was, um, some of it's left in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of the bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, you know, continuously mix
it or, you know, make sure you let it sit
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while and dissolve real well,
then, uh, you have a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, residue at the bottom of your,
your bucket, but, uh, great line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't think anything spectacular
came out at the end other than what I had
[SPEAKER_01]: been seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just basically have been just trying
to run everything to see what I like best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that's where I've, you know,
just settled on the bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellow bottles have been doing it for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until I find something else that,
that, uh, we'll beat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's it for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the veg bloom, I, I do still
use, um, the shine product that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it just adds a little bit of
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's in weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally use it weeks two on until
about week five or six in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just continue that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I start the winter frost
from new millennium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is so hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can anybody say that word right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Millennium.
[SPEAKER_01]: New millennium's winter frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when I add that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of the blue mellow bottles,
I just think it adds a little extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, the veg bloom, great
company, great line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, uh, moved on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: One line that I have tried, which I
believe you haven't tried is blue planet
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't tried them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, blue planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I bought like a kelp seaweed,
um, bottle from them once off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think I heard you talking about
blue planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I loved it, but I never used like
their whole line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought about it for a minute and
then I found blue mellow bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I tried them instead of ordering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the guy just loaded me up with,
you know, all the free samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ever since then I'm like,
Oh, so old on the blue mellow bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never went back and actually did the
full line of blue planet, but just that
[SPEAKER_01]: one product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did, you know, work really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used blue planet nutrients for,
for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about liquid seaweed by the
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's the name of the bottle is
liquid seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually use blue planet nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can speak about them for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my experience using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I use them for several years,
uh, had great results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started with their three part based
nutrients that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's their high yield system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a three part plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a whole bunch of different additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there was eight bottles total that
I would use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a lot of bottles there,
but they worked, they worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would start with a half dose and it,
you know, according to their feeding chart
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything went good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would just adjust based on what that
runoff PPM was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I did like about them is
that it almost kind of had that pH perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sense that advanced has every time I
mix up a half dose of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get 5.8 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what, uh, you know, no matter
which additives I used or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of convenient because I
knew exactly how much pH up I should be
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just made things a lot easier kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I'm in cocoa, I usually like
to do 5.8 in cocoa every time,
[SPEAKER_00]: just feed it in every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so mix up my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have to do any sort of pHing when
I'm growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing I did like to,
but yeah, I use their high yield system
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use their blue max.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two part that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that along with some additives as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, no complaints on that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah, I definitely was going
that route because I saw the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants were liking it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely was looking into them and
did that, did buy that liquid seaweed and
[SPEAKER_01]: liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, uh, I discovered
the bloom yellow bowels by chance at a
[SPEAKER_01]: local girl stores expo and, uh,
got sidetracked with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you add any sugars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Into your garden at all, whether it be
molasses or honey or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't only because I use a product
called recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure most, yeah, I'm sure you and
most everybody that's watching has heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of recharge before, but it's a microbary
microbial product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it has molasses in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't tend to add any extra because I
use that as my once a week treat as Scotty
[SPEAKER_01]: real says, and, uh, the girls are happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't tend to add anything extra,
but I would, if I didn't use recharge,
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably would add some sort of
sweetener cause you have to feed those
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in order for them to keep staying
alive, to do their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I do use, I'm a soil grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you were mentioning the, you like to
do the 5.8 and cocoa and, and I'm a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run, um, either coast of Maine or route
707.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally like, um, and for the first,
like two to three, four weeks of edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll, I'll switch over to my blue
mellow bottles after that and feed after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they start running out of food,
but you got to feed those microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to get, you know, them to be able to
keep doing their work, to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants to uptake those newts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would definitely use a sugar if
I was not using recharge, but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's really necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They seem to be doing their job with the
recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, uh, microbial inoculant,
which is another thing I was going to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you about is do you use any microbial
inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use recharge as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it has the molasses in there,
like you mentioned also has kelp in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it has a ton of different beneficial
microbes in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I love that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you use that throughout the entire
grow or do you just use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people only use it in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people only use it in flour,
but it is safe to use throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was curious if you've used it
throughout the entire growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a couple of products upon transplant
every time when I pot up, uh, called,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, azos and mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I use it every time I transplant up
and then I water and recharge every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use the recharge once a week until
about five weeks or week five of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll discontinue the use cause I
don't think it, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really needed too much at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it finishes off nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I use it through the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also another product from veg
bloom that I add in every now and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I mean what I have the bottle down
there and, or container, I should say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a bottle, but, um, of plus life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also another microbial product
that is, you know, from that veg bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll add that occasionally every couple
of weeks, just to give it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: different microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't, that's not in the recharge
and it seems to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the azos and mycos, uh, I've heard of
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had the chance to use them,
but I have a lot of good success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type products for both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume there's some other
beneficials in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm not going to be able to
explain exactly what's in those things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I used to follow along with you when I
was first starting growing, I used to
[SPEAKER_01]: follow a guy on YouTube called the
Grateful Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was first learning,
he was showing how to transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how you do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he always used a little bit of azos,
a little bit of mycos and then explained
[SPEAKER_01]: why.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's beneficial bacteria and
you've got to get those roots inoculated
[SPEAKER_01]: and blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, there, I am not going to be
able to spit out the scientific name of
[SPEAKER_01]: both of those products or what's in them,
but I do know that they make a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get really, really, uh, wonderful
root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I do a transplant with those two
products and then water and the recharge
[SPEAKER_01]: on top, it just seems to, um, explode the
root growth and, and the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes everything cohesive and,
uh, yeah, exactly what they need to get
[SPEAKER_01]: going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycorrhizal fungi is extremely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it actually attaches to the roots
and helps with the uptake of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people actually use it as a,
when they transplant, they'll sprinkle it
[SPEAKER_00]: onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people use it as like a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll mix it in with water and then
water their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use it, do you sprinkle it onto the
roots at all, or do you use it as soil
[SPEAKER_00]: drench or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is, uh, so when I'm
transplanting, I basically just do my
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom layer of soil and then where I'm
going to transplant in, I just sprinkle
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the Azos and the Mycos right on top
of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to even use very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the same bag for, geez,
I want to say probably a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just little small bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, you just sprinkle a tiny
bit of both of those products right in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the roots that have already grown
and been, um, substantial, they just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of make that contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you say, and once that contact is
made, it just kind of explodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, and then I water in the recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I've transplanted, that's what goes
in on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's just kind of like a double
duty hitting them from all sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar product to Azos and Mycos is Great
White Mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sprinkle it onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I use it as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people that use it in their,
um, compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll add that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's some controversy behind
it as if, uh, microbes kind of compete
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other and that you're kind of
wasting money because those microbes are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting eaten and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we won't get into all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also used, uh, Mammoth Pete,
which is a microbial inoculant that's,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, has microbes in that to focus on,
um, phosphorus breakdown helps with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with phosphorus breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many different microbial
products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as sugars, uh,
we touched on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually created a whole video on
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically use it as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually, I'll leave a link to that
video down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody wants to learn more about,
uh, molasses and how to incorporate it
[SPEAKER_00]: into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more and more places are becoming
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more growers are coming onto the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the comment sections are
flooded with beginners looking for advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What tips or advice do you have for those
who are new or are struggling to get
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding dialed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice is basically from my experience,
just look at your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they look happy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they droopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they show signs of deficiencies and,
or are they nice and green or are,
[SPEAKER_01]: do they have spots on them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they yellowing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just basically my advice is just
do your research on what your plants look
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're spotting something that doesn't
look normal, research it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many great resources now that
we have available to us between forums and
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube podcasters and everything that can
basically spell it out what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: with your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically that's the biggest advice I
can give you is just take a look at your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just automatically feed that four
tablespoons or teaspoons of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox farm to that gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or whatever that direction says,
just because it says it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just pay attention to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that will reward you in
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where can listeners find you and what
do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can find me on the Michigan bros
grow show on Sunday and Monday nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also on Instagram at painted lady
gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do have a cannabis account,
even though I'm guilty of not checking it
[SPEAKER_01]: too often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please forgive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabuzzers, uh, I can be found.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there at painted lady 13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I am excited to say that I have a,
a commercial, uh, possibility that I am
[SPEAKER_01]: working on right now, uh, here in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few partners and we're looking at
opening, um, a class C facility here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan, hopefully in the next year or
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, fingers crossed granted, you know,
timing is right and investors are willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's our next step, um, is going into
branding and, and trying to get those
[SPEAKER_01]: investors to give us the money to start
growing medicine, um, for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already do that as a caregiver here
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt, I love it so much that I just,
I just want to do it on a larger scale and
[SPEAKER_01]: do it professionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's what's on the horizon for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I would, uh, I'll be stoked
to be able to say that I'm a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Officially, uh, once that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, come check me out on the
Michigan bros grow show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link to your channel to
actually your Instagram down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also linked the Michigan bros grows
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that how you say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tongue twister there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, painted lady, thank you so much for
coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure to have you on here and,
uh, hope you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks guys.
Thank you so much for having me.
