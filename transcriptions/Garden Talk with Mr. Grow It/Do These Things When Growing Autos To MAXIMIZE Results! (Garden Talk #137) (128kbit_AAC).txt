[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 137.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Sebastian
Good from FastBuds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an expert when it comes to auto
flowers and has done many techniques over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years to help increase both quality
and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get into topics such as plant
nutrition, growing medium, container size,
[SPEAKER_01]: light cycle, environment conditions,
and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: These podcast episodes are broken up into
short clips and put on a dedicated YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channel called Garden Talk Clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we're back, and I'm joined with
Sebastian Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just coming back from Germany,
and it's like the Wild West over there now
[SPEAKER_00]: with a new legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic, because I'm German.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to my motherland and finally
having consumed the first ever legally,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is just healing, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy for everybody over in Germany
that finally got legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long time coming, but it's finally here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting into the topic today,
what we're going to talk about is
[SPEAKER_01]: maximizing yield with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are an expert when it comes to
autos, and you do techniques that are
[SPEAKER_01]: proven to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to hear all about it in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call myself Sebastian Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't ask me why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just needed another... I didn't want to
go with my real last name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still living in a somewhat prohibition
country in Spain right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we might change, we might move
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been on the road for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in contact with the plan for
like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consumed it when I was a young teenager,
and I realized this is something for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gardening this plan seriously
for a good 10 years, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In between, of course, I drew us a few
seeds, like a radio style in the woods or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really want to count that
because that's not when I really started
[SPEAKER_00]: fully emerging, trying to really get
better and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say doing it indoors, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a few years back, maybe about four,
four and a half years back, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I wanted to change in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pitched a podcast, the Fast Buds,
and talking about their... Because I love
[SPEAKER_00]: their products, I love their strains,
and I pitched it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yes, we don't want it
audio, we want it video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added a video to it, and the rest is
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's how I know you from Fast
Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met you over at the booth at MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, it was such a good time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and like, you know, meeting each
other because we all do similar things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we are full on 100% in for this
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we probably all got some
bad talks from our wives sometimes before
[SPEAKER_00]: because they were like, here, this is too
much, dude, you know, like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you have a family, this is just too
much, you know, you have to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, calm down, stress yourself even
if you're in with so much passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you meet like you or Rob or Pigeon
or, you know, Dakota from Homegrown TV,
[SPEAKER_00]: Q, Hi Again, and of course, Joe,
and all coming together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, it's like a field trip,
kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with people you kind of know,
but you don't really know in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just like, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just like, good, good times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a memorable week for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking forward to MJ BizCon this
year in 2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you start by explaining the basics of
auto flowers and why they're so popular
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst growers that are looking to
maximize yields?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, auto flowers are Ruderales.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the gene, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not, they have some indica,
they have some sativa, rarely only one or
[SPEAKER_00]: the other, you know, this, and they have
some Ruderales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this special thing about Ruderales is
that it is not photodependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, doesn't need light to flower,
it needs darkness to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have photoperiodic strands,
they need a certain darkness period,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was like their pump to go into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we shift our light cycle to
1212.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruderales doesn't need that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it basically is an escapee into,
it became feral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most likely is a descendant of
sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it grew in these very northern regions
like in Russia and in Eastern Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had very, very, very short summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to survive, it basically through
mutation, it developed this ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower without, with not caring because
they, summers, they are have very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very long sun lights, but they're
very, very, very short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and many people experimented with this
ditch, you know, this ditch plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it, and they,
a lot of people gave up on it because they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't really see that it, they didn't
really see it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, Neville Schoenmaker,
I don't know if it, if that rings a bell,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he is like a breeder of the
very, very first, like he collected
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics from all over the world and in
Amsterdam bred like stuff like the
[SPEAKER_00]: original haze and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really iconic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things, basically building stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: He already experimented with this in the
seventies, but he didn't see it going
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere because it's, it is a recessive
trade and it makes everything in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why when we go then a few steps
further, like, you know, in the two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands more or less when Sasha from
doctors choice also called the joint
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor, he came out with low rider,
which was the first commercially available
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he came out with it, he basically
bred for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a student at that time and he
wanted to have a strain, which is stay
[SPEAKER_00]: small and is quick and a stealth,
you know, but it only got like ye big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like only like a foot tall,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also was done after like eight,
nine weeks, you know, full, full circle,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people in that point
were just thinking it's like a novelty
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And didn't think it through because the
positive thing, why reading with it took
[SPEAKER_00]: off so fast and only 20 years is because
the life cycle cycle is so short,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have other varieties, I need so much
more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can maybe have two, two different,
you know, generations per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a max.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who am I talking to?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how long it takes to develop a
strain, you know, you did it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just imagine now, you have an eight week
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have, you can speed this whole
whole process up so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we are got so fast,
so far with autos, you know, because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody is just looking for that one,
one, one single trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a big enough populations,
if you like, you know, go on bigger phenol
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts and you really pick the ones,
Oh, I want the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want the ones which are yummy,
but they all still had need to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really do selective reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we are at this amazing
positions that we are have regular
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, which can compete against
photoperiodic strains, but much faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with this special trade of not needing
to change the photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know a lot about a lot of that
history that you just mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really, really cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, as far as them being real short
flowering period, I mean, you can add in a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole another cycle for that year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going just autos, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some of the autos I've grown are
like 75 days from sprout to harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and there are something even
quicker than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're looking at what 55,
60 days from sprout to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just needed to prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will come out with a video very,
very soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soon on the FastBuds YouTube, which will
be how to grow autos fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that does not include it's the exact
opposite of what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did something completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to prove that I can grow an auto
flower from seed to harvest in under eight
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 55 days, I grew our lemon cherry
cookies in my caravan right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it looks so funny here behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sitting actually in a caravan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been touring all through Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight thousand kilometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like six thousand miles, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five thousand miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew a plant in like a little grow
box touring through Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within 55 days, I grew her from seed
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, of course, you can't expect
them to have the highest yield if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have everything, you know,
but I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am happy because I can now talk with
people about even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned even more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, every time when we when
we grow, we learn more every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, we're doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit proud of myself for doing
that because I only had one single plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and I could have missed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I messed that up, you know, and I made
updates about that plant on social media
[SPEAKER_00]: every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That wasn't like not like the possibility
to have something in the background to
[SPEAKER_00]: just like, come on, let's switch that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you know, this one doesn't look so
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I'm happy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a lot of people who are
wondering growing medium certainly has a
[SPEAKER_01]: big impact on yield container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another thing that kind of goes hand
in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can certainly yield can certainly
be impacted by that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your recommendations for what
growing medium and what container size and
[SPEAKER_01]: type to use when growing autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, like, let's put myself
aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about maximizing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to have a always
maximizing yield and you want to bank on
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I mean, it doesn't matter what you
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to most likely go to DWC because
you will have bigger yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter if you have photos
or autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't matter at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like the nature kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's so let's come from the
perspective soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would always and I that's one very,
very important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autos need a very, very airy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to have when any even if you
have a light mix or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: throw some extra perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, pumice, you know,
or whatever you can get your fingers on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need that extra air on their roots
just to be able to spread and fill out the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire, entire planter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we come to the container size is
the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, container size matters and
nowhere else does it matter as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers, because if you want to have
huge autos, you will need to give her
[SPEAKER_00]: oversized pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can grow in smaller pots,
too, but it will go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as goes down, it will just,
you know, it knows it basically like
[SPEAKER_00]: figures out, oh, this is how much space I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how big I can get because that's
one of the main factors which will
[SPEAKER_00]: determine on how big it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you just put it in a tiny
container, that's by the by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the tricks how I grew it so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in a just not in a tiny container
that doesn't matter how wide it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be super wide if it is only very
short and shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be a deep, not a shallow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs a deep container so that the
taproot can go really far down,
[SPEAKER_00]: really far down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have airy soil or airy medium
and a deep container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that are the two huge factors which
you which will help you grow and maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: your yields and autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger the roots, bigger the fruits is
what a lot of people say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that definitely holds true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of folks that grow autos and
they say five gallon container or larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or some people say seven gallon
container or larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going after these larger
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're often just planting the seed
directly in there and not doing any
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting, which we're going to talk
about transplanting here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first I want to ask about nutrient
lineups.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when growing autos in particular,
what specific nutrient lineups or
[SPEAKER_01]: additives are most effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, look, I'm a living soil grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I'm trying to feed my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if my soil is healthy and happy,
then I don't have to pour so much on the
[SPEAKER_00]: top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather have everything in my amended
in my soil already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my microbes and my fungi and my,
you know, bacteria, they will help to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: my plant and my plant will just take
whatever it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people and now we're coming back
a little bit to this container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, I want to reduce them as an example,
because these are the people who I know
[SPEAKER_00]: who grew, grow some of the biggest auto
flowers I've ever seen anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is Kana Matos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have heard of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in Canada and auto grows whales,
obviously somewhere in Wales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have this system and it is,
I think they use monkey nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a mineral baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do is they have these giant
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how big they are,
like 15 gallon or something like really
[SPEAKER_00]: big, relatively deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stand on the self watering basis and
they're not auto pots, but the other one,
[SPEAKER_00]: mega pots, I think they call themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they add an additional air base
because as I said, auto flowers love this
[SPEAKER_00]: airy soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you add an extra boost of oxygen in,
it will help the plant to uptake not only
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, but also the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys have grown with this setup,
mega pots with monkey nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple times reproducible auto flowers,
which yield more than a pound one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty good deal there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually never heard of monkey
nutrients off the look into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they're, I think it might
be British.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it might be British.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure, I'm sure you can do that with a
lot of nutrient lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would always suggest is don't start
overfeeding your autos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Less is more, especially in the beginning,
because if you overfeed them, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: burn them.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a photo periodic plan,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give her two weeks extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: The auto will say no stress flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have a foot tall,
tall plant and you're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not going to maximize your
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that sense, less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, and I think we talked about
this before, and when you were on fast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but stocks for me, adding microbes,
adding fungi, adding all this to my soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you are feeding mineral based
nutrients, it certainly won't hurt your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it will certainly just help your
plants uptake more food and more food,
[SPEAKER_00]: more bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mostly used on growing autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I've only grown about two dozen auto
flower plants total.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a photo guy, but for my little bit of
experience growing autos, I've grown with
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox farm trio had some really good results
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue planet nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown them organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've grown them a wide different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: People with Athena have great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, we could, we could keep on,
keep on going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to have like the more bio kind
of line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who grow fire bud with,
with, with bio biz, you know, and for me
[SPEAKER_00]: personally, I'm not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have my nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we talked about this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's you experience with
experiment with things back and forth,
[SPEAKER_00]: back and forth, you know, and I mean,
I'm not set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really want to mess with,
mineral based nutrients so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like me because I think we didn't
talk about this in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I grew up planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my family has gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: My great grandfather was a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he was growing flowers, you know,
he had a flower shop and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of with me in my blood,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that it's, I think I understood
very early on that, like if I'm good,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I have good soil and if I, I make sure
that my soil is alive and has everything
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody needs, then I don't have to
worry so much about like force feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the organics, a lot of people swear
by the flavor as well, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: different conversation here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't get into that, but you can
certainly get some really good,
[SPEAKER_01]: good results on the organic side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into light schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you already talked about how auto
flowers can stay on the same light
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the ideal light schedule though?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do an 18 hours with lights
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do 20 hours with lights on,
four hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do a continuous 24 hours with
the lights on, zero off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that better?
[SPEAKER_01]: What light schedule do you personally
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also if you can get into types of
light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about like a full spectrum
LED light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to be better than your
traditional HPS, like the MH, HPS combo or
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's now a philosophy with auto
flowers and light cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I like back in the day,
I was, I was just because they really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't give a damn that much really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I used to have fantastic
results with having a seven one schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that funny?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were recommending my light to
be turned off every never on longer than
[SPEAKER_00]: eight hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only let it run seven hours,
had it an hour off seven hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: had an hour off seven hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm away from that, but yeah, it's hard to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autos love light, but everybody needs some
sleep sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what schedule you go,
I would give them just out of kindness,
[SPEAKER_00]: give them some rest sometimes.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but then again, I'm talking about Ken
Amato.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs 24 seven, I'm pretty sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's growing pound autos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, um, not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest to run, if you don't care
about electricity bill, I would not just
[SPEAKER_00]: run an 18 six light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, but the amount you get more
out of it or better, the amount you,
[SPEAKER_00]: the time you will be faster with running
like a 24 or even a 22 two or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, or even the 24 zero is not a is
not justified by spending that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know how expensive,
you know, electricity is by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we already talking about maximizing
yield, we probably want to try to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio of the amount of money we spend to
what will we get out in the end at a
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my last run for the auto flower world
cup was, uh, I was running, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: them 24 seven four six weeks or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after six weeks, I got, got them down
to like, I think like 19 five,
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see, I prefer towards the end of
flower to amp up the light, to really give
[SPEAKER_00]: them even maybe hang an extra light in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you said, like maybe even hang an HPS
on top of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically just fry them with light,
but to give them some breaks in between,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, while in the vegetative,
base, they really don't give a damn in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end, to be honest with you, you know,
unless you start going less than 18 six,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, don't go like, you know,
like 12 12 or 14 10, or we can keep on
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't go under the 18 six ever for no
reason other than if you believe in this
[SPEAKER_00]: theory, you want to shut them,
the lights off the last two days before,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you harvest them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never really seen any much of a
difference in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was forced to, to put autos on
a 12 12 before, just cause my whole 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some photos and I was mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to do it and I didn't get as good
as a result as I would have if I kept it
[SPEAKER_01]: on an 18 six light cycle or something
longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm with you right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent like, but it doesn't
mean you can't grow autos in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's, for example, like where you
are, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have really humidity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you have very low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably very, you'll probably
have a humidifier running 24 seven
[SPEAKER_00]: basically in your, in your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it won't hurt if you have the extra
space and you're not worried about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have issues with light with air
circulation or something, adding a few
[SPEAKER_00]: extra autos in your 10 just for the fun of
it and the transpiration, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the more soil you have in there,
the more plants you have in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more humidity automatically comes,
comes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't, that doesn't hurt,
you know, just to amp up the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you have to switch to 12 12,
I mean, I mean, you'll, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just won't have the that big of a
yield, but you know that before you start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about environment conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking temperature relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically aim for when trying
to maximize yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold big, big, when it's hot autos won't
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As tall, you know, when they see a summer
and see a yay, let's go, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: super intense light, super warm
temperatures, you know, doesn't let,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's talk about the humidity in a minute,
but just these factors together,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will make auto flowers grow less
tall, therefore faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would always try to suggest,
keep your temperatures like, so now we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go, I have to do the math because
I'm back for too long back in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the Fahrenheit on my things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would try to keep my, keep my grow,
especially in the first five weeks under
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's that 70 something 77 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like let's say seven rather keeping by
75, you know, and I wouldn't go obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: under like 68.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like really I wouldn't try to keep
it in that range in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, and you will just have taller
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also don't necessarily, if you want to
maximize your yield, amp your light up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the very beginning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They, if they search a little bit for the
light, they stretch more, they stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: more, stretch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if they're a bit more stretch,
if they're taller, obviously in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what was the rain?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a lot of people that do
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the rain?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said 25 as a high, what was the low
for Celsius?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's say 21, 22, let's say 20 to
25, especially in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we come more towards flower,
I don't mind so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can go higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go up to like 27, 28, but
eventually once we go higher than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to fry our tarps out,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want something delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to, the sweet spot is between
20 and 27 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously the humidity depends
very much in what part of the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: stadium you are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like it is with photoperiodic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the actual humidity is
that different from photoperiodic strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep them very, in the first week or
so, like I keep them at 70%, something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like, you know, you have to,
and there you also have to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this is the same again with
photoperiodic strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can stress them with the light on top
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, if you make it way too hot,
they will just stretch like crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you have like these like
asparagus is standing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you hear a lot of people say genetics,
genetics, genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How important is the choice of strain when
aiming for high yields without flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you recommend some top performing
strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always love to say you can,
you can mess up anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean genetics, but you can grow
something fantastic out of trash genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if the, if the, if the,
if the information isn't there,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter if it's you or anybody who is
like, you know, the most pro grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have, have not good genetics,
it will just not, it will just not work as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in terms of genetics, high yield,
it always helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if they have at least like 50%
sativa at least, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know sativas are just not as
fast as, as indicus and fast is in this
[SPEAKER_00]: sense, our enemy, because we do not have
that control of, eh, yeah, just let her
[SPEAKER_00]: veg another two or three weeks and then
just, you know, scrub her out and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, you need to go with the
life cycle of the plan and sativa dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: autoflowers tend to have higher yields
than indica dominant autoflowers because
[SPEAKER_00]: they just need more time and therefore
they will have a little bit more of a time
[SPEAKER_00]: period to actually grow bigger,
taller, you know, and therefore will yield
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you work for fast buds and
you've grown out so much of their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have maybe like a top two or three
strains that you can kind of recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything with the word gorilla
will be, uh, will be very satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like there's a GG four cut in,
uh, in the Holy Hall somewhere or fast
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, which, uh, did some miracles and it
worked really well with, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's strawberry gorilla, gorilla
cookies, or, um, gorilla skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, these genetics, they grow big,
they grow tall, they grow fat nuggets,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have, they're terpy, they're strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're like our flagships if you
want to, you know, so when I went to visit
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeding facilities, there were
literally rooms with 200, 300 plans just
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, because we know that is what a
lot of customers ask for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if you go in a commercial
production, then which really is the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: by now, like there is really a commercial
autoflower production and they just want,
[SPEAKER_00]: they need to go for a yield, of course,
you know, and then like stuff like our
[SPEAKER_00]: purple lemonade, as I said, like if you
start looking a little bit more into,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the, into the genetics, you know,
the orange sherbert, wedding cheesecake,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these varieties will be having at
least 50% sativa heritage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will just help to, you know,
just make the plan that much bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that just helps because if
the plan's ready in eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's big plans in eight weeks,
but it's just a little less time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to circle back to transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is something that when it comes
to transplanting autos, the community is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of divided on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some people that say never
transplant auto, always plant your autos
[SPEAKER_01]: directly into the final container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't transplant at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have other people that say,
yo, transplant's really fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to slow down the plan at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people say it actually increases
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll hold off on my thoughts until
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: You answer, but give us your thoughts on
transplanting autos, when to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when we transplant, you know,
our medicinal plants, we like so much in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, we usually wait for the root ball
to really like, you know, we love this
[SPEAKER_00]: like root porn, I guess we call it,
you know, just take the container off and
[SPEAKER_00]: you look, and it's just white everything
you do that with autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have already flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like a little bit like I would
not wait that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like that would not not do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally also would always,
always definitely try to hit her with
[SPEAKER_00]: some, you know, mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she just like minimum intervention,
I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I very successfully plan the
transplanted autoflowers many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like, don't wait too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but generally speaking, the people who
grew the biggest autos I have seen so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: follow me with this, they just throw it in
the final container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so of course, there will be
people out there and say, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people do it very, very
successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just starting this out and
stuff, and you don't have these like
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that you need to transplant that
you like have that you don't have the have
[SPEAKER_00]: the final, you know, that you don't have
the space issue, then now don't don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just talked to somebody in
North Macedonia, who's growing some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla cookies, like, I think 3600 or
something like that at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, he was asking me,
I have my plants started flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you left them like for I
don't know, like five weeks in like,
[SPEAKER_00]: three lead leader, like less than a gallon
containers, you know, which aren't super,
[SPEAKER_00]: super deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just, you know, they just hit the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just like the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were like, yeah, I'm done here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you know, let's wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like four more weeks and I'm done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a common thought that people say
and I don't know if that's it's true or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it true that when the if it's in a
small container, the roots at the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: pod starts circling, that's going to
induce flowering faster than if the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: were in a larger container and the roots
were kind of spreading out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there is there truth to that at all or
no?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ask me, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there's a truth to it, because you
will grow the biggest, biggest autos like
[SPEAKER_00]: by by by sheer size, not necessarily
healed if you do them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it in the right climate
outdoors and the plant can stretch and can
[SPEAKER_00]: go wherever it wants to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so but of course, if you have a
giant container and you're over water,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then it's like you have this
like tiny little ball, which is like full
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it's almost like you have
an extra pot inside of that pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, where the plant doesn't want to go
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can happen to you in a big
container, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, I would I believe,
as we said in the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger the roots, the bigger the
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you give that auto flower enough
space, it will it will thank you with a
[SPEAKER_00]: big yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned mycorrhizal fungi
during transplanting, which is what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a key that a lot of people do is
they expose the roots during that
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting process that gives them the
opportunity to sprinkle that mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi onto the roots, which is super
beneficial in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I like to do actually for
not just autos, but for photos as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: dump a little bit of worm castings in the
bottom of the hole during transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually do like quarter cup,
dump that down in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help with give it a little
bit more nutrition and beneficial microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: as well down by the root zone where you
sprinkle the mycorrhizal fungi on there as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are a couple of tips for people
to do if they do decide to do the
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, for example, now with my like
tiny grow, because I still with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with my with my fifty five day
plant, I still use living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was really hard in a like two and a
half gallon container kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to keep that alive, I made sure to
always add very, very with every watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, very trace amounts of either fungi
or bacteria microbes just to keep that
[SPEAKER_00]: life in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because otherwise, you know, you're with
these tiny containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had still and I have to this day,
I moved the container after I cut her,
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in front of my caravan now with some
ornamental plants in it and a tiny little
[SPEAKER_00]: baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's still living worms in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives me it proves me that it did
work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to plant training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are several different plant
training techniques that you can do on
[SPEAKER_01]: your autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do low stress training,
some do topping, super copying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What training do you recommend for folks
that are looking to increase yields when
[SPEAKER_00]: growing autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't top autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that you can't top them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to I would like do it at the
third or fourth note, like early,
[SPEAKER_00]: early, early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't go wait too long because
if you wait too long, then you might just
[SPEAKER_00]: stress her back into flower really quick
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be that it won't be that crazy
for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if you do it early on,
it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, these guys who yield these
crazy amounts of with autos, they they
[SPEAKER_00]: they train.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like train.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in there all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to you have to expose the sides
to make it to make to make it possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, it's not it's not going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it for me personally, I don't do it so
much, but I'm also coming from often from
[SPEAKER_00]: a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take photos of these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to, you know, I need to move them
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just like tie them somewhere here
and somewhere there in my in my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it has to be all movable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also when you photograph a lot like or
video a lot, you want to show the people
[SPEAKER_00]: how does this plant grow naturally,
not how does this plant look after I bend
[SPEAKER_00]: bend it in all different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the things which work for
photoperiod extrinsic work for other
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've trained the heck out of them
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just maximizes the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can see it with any plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs time to bounce to bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing for an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time you will train an auto,
it will depending on how heavy you train
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but we're probably going to set her
back like a week or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will make it make it take longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do it, you might as well make it
worthwhile because you need to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: much more of a yield other than,
you know, finishing up quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best result I've ever gotten growing
an auto was just low stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew car malicious by MSNL.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was had to have been 10 years ago
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 10 different seeds and some of the
plants I like grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think two or three I like grow
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two or three I did the low stress training
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did some topping and compared
everything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the topping ones didn't do as good as
just the low stress training ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually didn't do good as the
one growing naturally as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the naturally grown ones with no
training was about five to six ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the trained ones with low stress
training was seven to eight ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the topping was, I think it was
four to five ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it was all from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's differences in the phenotype
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, this is, I'm not a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me just doing experiment my home
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what I observe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, that's how we can figure out,
figure out what works best for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say if you don't,
if you are depending on this plan,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the, on these plans, like, so meaning
you don't want to just test it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably have good chances.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top the right, you do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You train her over a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably have high chances that that
plan might be the biggest deal there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we don't really need it anymore so
much because we can train without the
[SPEAKER_00]: topping with low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it doesn't matter if it's
butt clips or if you tie her down,
[SPEAKER_00]: just make sure that you're, you know,
that you have an even canopy in the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere gets the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most likely if you just perform some
decent amounts of low stress training,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will have the highest yield per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let me challenge that for one
second, because what if I, instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to find an otter flower,
which is taking 10, 11 weeks, 12 weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a sativa dominant one, what if I take
one of my lemon cherry cookies or banana
[SPEAKER_00]: purple punch, heavy indica, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can be ready in only eight weeks
from seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I space that out over the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can just, I have within, I can,
you know, run her one more time within
[SPEAKER_00]: three growth cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have her in three growth cycles
while I have the others only two growth
[SPEAKER_00]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bam, I'm back at the heels, you know,
so like that is really a philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that moment, I wouldn't even train her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let them go, do their thing,
you know, do some light defoliation,
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum intervention, finish them in
eight, maximum nine weeks, be done with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and can grow new instead of growing
one 12 weeks or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and this is just, you know,
good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways you can go
about it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's transition over to problems,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there can be problems with otter
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say are the top three
problems that growers face when growing
[SPEAKER_01]: otter flowers and give us a solution to
those problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the top number?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the number one problem everybody,
especially beginners will have with any
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give her more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to give more water, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have pockets of where all that
water is at and basically the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: just think this is, and this is a real,
real issue with otter flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will just basically be,
have no more air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just talked in the beginning about it,
how important for otter flowers that is to
[SPEAKER_00]: have very, you know, airy soil because
they need a lot of air and you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocate the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to stress, she's going to
start flowering as a baby and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a tiny little plant,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we definitely have our number one
issue, but I guess it's, it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiving if you go for the periodic
expense, but like, you know, so,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yes, it's in that sense, it's,
I guess a bit more specific to otters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next issue, probably nutrients
overfeeding because once you overfeed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't let them bounce back,
you know, like they're most likely will
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, you can flush them,
but then in the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will just not get as big and
everything because they will eventually go
[SPEAKER_00]: shift into flowering, especially if
they're stressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means again, I messed it up in a
sense that I will just have a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess environmental issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think a lot of times what people
would like tell you why otter flowers are
[SPEAKER_00]: not as good as for the periodic strains is
because they often have like fluffy buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ever noticed that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, these fluffy buds come
from a few, a few little factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the end of the day, an otter flower
will need very, very much light,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very intense light towards the end of
the life cycle to really develop these,
[SPEAKER_00]: these nuggets we all like, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humidity issues like you have to be so
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even say powdery mildew or all
these kinds of issues or bud rot we get so
[SPEAKER_00]: easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If our humidities are too high during
flowering, you get, you have less of that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with otter flowers because they
are just more resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, they're tough bitches if you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because, you know, these, these ladies
where they, they, they come from much
[SPEAKER_00]: worse conditions, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like Siberia and stuff, but to get
this density, if you have too much
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in your air, they, these buds
will not get very dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will just stay more fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you want to end up with nice,
like harder rocks, you just have to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to, try to keep the humidity down towards
the last two weeks of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, even, you know, in the last two
weeks, you don't have to have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: which looks like the healthiest plant in
the world anymore because we're not want
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep her alive for forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we want her to put everything she
got into these beautiful nuggets because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we want in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is a, that's a big,
big issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too many people know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good list right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to meet a new grower in
person and they're saying, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm brand new and I'm about to start
growing autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you have for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mean brand new grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's re-specify it like brand new grower
period or brand new grower to autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like somebody who might have already in
brand new autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody who already, already grows
other like photoperiodic strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink it and don't, you know
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let her grow to find out what
it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mess around here and there a
little bit, but let her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like learn the life cycle of an auto
flowering plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn how to, how to determine,
you know, and then all these tips we've
[SPEAKER_00]: said before, or airy soil for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you want her to be big,
big containers, you know, and if you want
[SPEAKER_00]: her and don't overfeed her because she
will not have the chance to bounce back
[SPEAKER_00]: like any other plant, you know,
because the stress is the worst thing for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for, for an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you stress them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they will just go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how simple it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you stress her too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously you can stress her to
death, but like that's, and that's would
[SPEAKER_00]: be, dramatic, but you know, if you just
stress her enough, she'll just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I'm going to the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: The future of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you foresee any innovations in the
cultivation of auto flowers that could
[SPEAKER_01]: help growers potentially achieve even
higher yields in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's more genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, of course there will be always
innovations in cultivation, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I'm just like visited some facility
of aquaponics are just like, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, Hey, yeah, now I can have my
fish, fish take care of my nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a whole cycle, especially,
you know, in areas where you live,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you just don't have as much water
technically available.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when the very dry areas, you know,
flow systems like that are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we will, there is already
something called like super autos,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like very few, which are,
they take a lot longer, but they still do
[SPEAKER_00]: the shift by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually just had an interview and I
just talked with Sasha, the joint doctor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the person who really developed them like
30 years ago, and they went to the market
[SPEAKER_00]: over 20 years ago with the first auto
flowers with low rider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, we probably just scratched
the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, we will figure out much
more, you know, how to manipulate that and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe have, you know, these varieties
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're so specific in terms of
that they're targeting to so in such a
[SPEAKER_00]: high percentage, the, the home growers
market, but there's so much more to that
[SPEAKER_00]: in the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can save so much plastic if you
instead of do light depth, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in all the humbled and Mendocino and
so on, you know, where all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, a lot of fires grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have fire autos, you know,
you don't have to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think we are coming to a
point where auto flowers can compete with
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiodic strains and we have cups
which are being won.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly but steady with auto flowers
against photoperiodic strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we come there, like we need to
get a little bit higher with the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, we have really, really terpy autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just, I'm just understand me,
but they still, there is the most room for
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement in my opinion is in the,
in the, in the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like when we think about the final
product, that once we're there in a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, I think that we have a good chance
that people will take it more serious and
[SPEAKER_00]: that they will do much more scientific
based breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will get auto flowers, which can
work for specific climates, which just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where it's very hard to grow
and, and so on and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's much, much,
much, much, much room for improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just started.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see where the
future, what holds in the future for autos
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are going to like
this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are interested in
growing autos or the grow auto now or plan
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow autos in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely some good information
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell listeners how they could find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm, you know, I'm making all the
videos for FastBuds so you can go to all
[SPEAKER_00]: the outlets, no matter if you want to
watch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have them even on Telegram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm focused on is on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go to FastBuds Genetics,
you know, as a channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just started with the legalization
in Germany because I am German and I just
[SPEAKER_00]: started another YouTube channel where
anybody wants to watch the content in
[SPEAKER_00]: German, you know, FastBuds Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where, where people can find
most of my content I produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I like explain more where I will
release this video about how to grow autos
[SPEAKER_00]: fast, you know, probably will come up with
a video or another video of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize yields with just new stuff
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just coming back from Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an interview with you in there
too, after we came back from, from BizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to hit me up personally,
so if you want to have me personally
[SPEAKER_00]: writing back to you, then it's the best on
Instagram and that's called
[SPEAKER_00]: Sebastiangood420.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you find me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to answer all DMs I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think sometimes it's just,
sometimes it's getting too much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do my best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my best.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely have a link to
Sebastian's Instagram down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also put it as a pinned comment just so
you can easily get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him a follow and yeah, good
conversation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you coming on Sebastian.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always fantastic to link up and to
talk about the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's, I think if we wouldn't
love doing this, we couldn't do this,
no?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to hear from the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for growing auto
flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know down in the comment section
below and hit that thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already, that definitely
helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you all and catch you in the
next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
