[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're adding, you know, algae to the
soil, if you're adding rock sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing to the soil,
you can come back and measure it two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four weeks later and see whether
it's having an impact increasing the
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it is, you want to continue to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the plant seed germinates in new
soil, it brings with it the kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that are beneficial to that
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start out knowing what the soil food web
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be really easy to start
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go chemical, you got to figure out
what those chemicals do, how much to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much to measure, when to use them,
when not to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes gardening work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not supposed to be work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a wonderful hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Jeff
Lowenfels.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a well-known author, mostly known
for your incredible Teaming with series.
[SPEAKER_01]: You released Teaming with Micros back in
2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I actually have right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, awesome book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teaming with nutrients in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teaming with fungi in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually put out an auto flowering
book as well in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then brand new, just released,
now available, Teaming with Bacteria here
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just ordered that today, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to start reading it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I've obviously read it, but it really
messed me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I used to have a trilogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call myself Lord of the Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's what's known as a quadrilogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually a word, quadrilogy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four books on the same basic subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for people to get into this
new book because it really is a major
[SPEAKER_00]: change to the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to get into my microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to start with the basics of the
soil food web and then get a bit deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: into things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, before we do that, what I like
to do with all guests is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm 73 years old, maybe 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started gardening when I was about six
months old in a little basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: My father used to bring me out to his
gigantic garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a frustrated New York city worker
who lived out in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would come home and he would
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to be around my dad,
you garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I learned at an early age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, he was not organic until,
oh, I would say I was about 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned as a chemical head and then
was exposed to organic gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you had just started actually back
then, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been gardening ever since and
I've been organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically ever since with one small
exception, a chemical that is very well
[SPEAKER_00]: known, a very well known fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy that was in charge and sort of
vented the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it ends in GRO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worked for my dad and my grandfather and
put my picture on a margarine package.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were in the butter business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he made me happy boy margarine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can Google that and find my picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because of our friendship with him,
we would be organic, except occasionally
[SPEAKER_00]: we'd use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned since that that product is
not good for the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that probably gives us a good jump off
point to talk about what the soil food web
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the soil food web and why should
gardeners care about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, everybody, I think, is familiar
with what's known as a food chain with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little guy gets eaten by the bigger guy
who gets eaten by the bigger guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are all these chains down in
the soil of various organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every now and then something on one of
the chains looks up or looks down and sees
[SPEAKER_00]: a different chain and says, hey,
I can I can eat that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they connect these chains,
get connected together and they form a
[SPEAKER_00]: web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a description of who eats
whom in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, normally we would leave it there,
but we're gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we grow vegetables and we grow
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow all sorts of terrific plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so so from our perspective,
the soil food web also includes the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant is in charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes photosynthetic energy,
up to 50 percent of it, and it creates
[SPEAKER_00]: these things that drip out of the root
zone that attract bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're attracting the bacteria and
fungi because the bacteria and fungi need
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon that's in these exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're exudating right now sweat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sweat actually attracts bacteria
and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the soil, it attracts the bacteria
and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very happy living right by the
root zone in what's known as the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, that little area right around
the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they in turn attract the things that
eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa, which we all studied in high
school, amoebas and paramecium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people think back to 10th grade,
they may remember that from biology class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and nematodes, which are a true
microscopic worm, their hair size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they eat the bacteria and the fungi
because they need carbon, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they take the carbon out of the
bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the excess is pooped out for want of a
better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nutrients in plant usable form,
particularly all important nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is moved into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how the plant feeds itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, notice I say the plant feeds itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it needs a different kind of food,
if it needs to protect itself a different
[SPEAKER_00]: way, it can attract different populations
of bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do what the plant needs it to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not me and you, the gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the plant that's in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's the basic soil food web
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there have been over the years three
things, I'm going to say, that have added
[SPEAKER_00]: to that soil food web picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is known as rhizobia bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You and I know that as the stuff that we
roll, you know, that we roll legumes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it forms when the root hairs form,
they curl around a bacteria that's
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to the plant by the plant,
which gives that bacteria a little a
[SPEAKER_00]: little space where oxygen can be limited
and it can fix nitrogen, feed the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's the second part of the
self with the third part of the soil food
[SPEAKER_00]: web, which I covered in the book in 2017,
I guess, teeming with fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fungi are the fungi that associate
with the roots and form a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship, mycorrhizal fungi,
and they take these nutrients from the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and move them right into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got basically two things that are
moving nutrients into the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: this rhizobia, although more of it comes
when it dies, and these mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the fourth book, teeming with
bacteria, is about what are known as
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those bacteria that are attracted
by the exudates that the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: producing as a result of photosynthetic
energy that it's using, some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria are tricked by the plant to back
into the very tips cells, the meristem
[SPEAKER_00]: cells in the root, and they're tricked to
back into that cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go through the cell wall,
but they don't go into the membrane
[SPEAKER_00]: cytoplasm section of the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you would imagine, I always use the
tofu container that you see at your
[SPEAKER_00]: supermarket, the outer white part,
that plastic, that's the cell wall of the
[SPEAKER_00]: root meristem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tofu in the inside is all of the
goodies that are inside the cell,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the things that make enzymes and do
all the organelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But around that tofu, it's floating in
this water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's known in cellular talk as the
periplasmic space, and that's where these
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get in there, and the plant sprays
them with a special super oxygenated
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical molecules, and they strip off the
cell wall of the bacteria and absorb that
[SPEAKER_00]: internally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they don't have a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They begin to move around that little
liquid section in the tofu container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they do, they don't have any cell
wall anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They multiply, bacteria multiply every 20
seconds, I mean, every 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they don't have a cell wall,
so it's probably even quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they multiply, they produce a
nitrate that they spray at the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop it from causing it to decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turns into nitrates, which the
plant absorbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these bacteria are circulating
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is circulating these bacteria,
and they're multiplying inside the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: roots meristem cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also producing ethylene,
which causes the root to stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cell begins to stretch out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what ethylene does inside a cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get too plentiful, they back up
against the cell wall, producing ethylene.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not being circulated anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being produced in one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create a little tube to form in the
cell wall, and out grows a root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bacteria are thrown into that root
hair, and they're blown out of that root
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are five or six explosions as
the root hair grows, throwing these
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria back out into the soil,
where they regrow their cell walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: re-nutrify themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a couple, three or four days
later, go back into a new meristem cell to
[SPEAKER_00]: do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've got is the plant sort of
farming in the first instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's putting an exudate out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attracting bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's attracting, and it farms those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got a situation where the plant
is bringing them into the barn,
[SPEAKER_00]: shearing off the wool, taking a couple of
lamb chops, and then putting these guys
[SPEAKER_00]: back out into the pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're ranching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got plants farming and ranching.
[SPEAKER_00]: That latter part is known as, I pronounce
it, the rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhizo meaning root, remember rhizosphere,
that area right around the root,
[SPEAKER_00]: and phagy, which means eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like root eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got that name because the discoverer in
Australia in 2010, so it's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you probably haven't heard
about it, literally thought that the cell
[SPEAKER_00]: was opening up and bringing in the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not happening now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a gentleman named Dr. James
White at Rutgers University, who is really
[SPEAKER_00]: the guru of this stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really quite something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got Dr. Elaine Ingham with the
original soil food web and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: greats and the mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden we've got this new
thing that results from the ability to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to see using different kinds of
microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different kinds of testing to ensure
that what's going on is what we think is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a mouthful, wasn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to back up to the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that pretty briefly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from my understanding, the rhizosphere
is a very, very small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking one to three millimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's directly outside the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really that's where the cookies and
cakes with Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_01]: talks about are in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's where the actual exchange
is happening with the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got some pictures of that,
by the way, in teaming with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenomenal pictures of these exudates
attracting bacteria in that little zone
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pH of the rhizosphere versus in the
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of folks, they're gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will do a runoff test to check the pH
or they'll do a slurry test or they'll use
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Blue Lab probe that you can stick
right into the medium and get an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, from my understanding,
the pH in the rhizosphere can be
[SPEAKER_01]: drastically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course it can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it's the only pH that counts
if you're an organic gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't care what the pH is up on the
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no roots there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's being absorbed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And incidentally, when I use that word
absorb, root hairs, when I learned and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you learned, we always thought the
purpose of a root hair was not to put
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria out into the soil, which turns
out to be their real purpose, but to
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb nutrients, which they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they absorb the nutrients as
the root grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The older hairs are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't think they're absorbing
nutrients as they're blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the pictures in the book are
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, you see these bacteria pushed
into this tube that is the root hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The root hair is part of that original
cell and they're blown out into,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the pH may matter to them out
there, but you and I, as gardeners taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of plants, it's the pH in that
rhizosphere that we really care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's caused by all the metabolites in
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The antioxidants and whatnot that are
produced, we don't recognize how big these
[SPEAKER_00]: populations of microbes are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria, holy crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always encourage people, I didn't
include the picture in the book because it
[SPEAKER_00]: costs $400, but I always encourage people
to look up on the web, head of a pin,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, and then go to images.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's several pictures of bacteria
on the head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we think of bacteria, we're not
thinking about the unbelievable numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're producing stuff all the time
that impacts the quality of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slime, which creates soil structure and
sticks things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pH, it's really all happening at
this little teeny level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know about it as gardeners
because we can't really see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would you say measuring the pH of the
runoff or doing a slurry test is
[SPEAKER_01]: pointless?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not useful to do because of the pH in
the rhizosphere being the only thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: really matters?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had any real use for it,
although it's nice to know what the pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you take your pH someplace in
the root zone, not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizosphere, and it's way out of whack,
there's a need for a fix there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it's not impacting the bacteria
and the fungi and the nematodes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: protozoa right there in the rhizosphere,
it's impacting I think other microbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the soil food web that are outside
of the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, they're not particularly
a waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like is, and I have to reveal that
I'm an advisor to the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: is something called a microbiometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: An invention that enables you for five
bucks and 10 minutes to test the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome mass of your soil, which
correlates to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has built in now a pH reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can sort of correlate some of
this stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite an invention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it at www.microbiometer.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really quite useful because it tells
you whether what you're doing is teeming
[SPEAKER_00]: with microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I was going to ask you about the
microbiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you do with that information
if you were to get a result and the result
[SPEAKER_01]: is, correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not too
familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you a bacteria to fungi ratio,
and then you can kind of make adjustments
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would somebody go about taking the
reading and then making adjustments in
[SPEAKER_01]: that garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it also gives you a number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially it was just the number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the company added fungal bacteria
because it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it's important is
because fungal dominated soils versus
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria dominated soils are produced two
different kinds of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so things that are in the ground for
less than a year, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, annuals, row crop kind of
things, they like the nitrate that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria produce when they break down and
decay organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas trees and shrubs, they like the
stuff that fungi break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you want to try to get a ratio
that's appropriate for your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a real gross
oversimplification.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need both in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the number tells you a starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take a test later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the number's high enough, you know
right away that your soils are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the number is low and or changes based
upon what you're doing, if you're adding
[SPEAKER_00]: algae, to the soil, if you're adding rock
sand, whatever you're doing to the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can come back and measure it two or
three, four weeks later and see whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's having an impact, increasing the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it is, you want to continue to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to actually talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting because a lot of
people see algae in their garden and think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think they need to start eradicating
the algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to make much of changes in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after reading your book, Team with
Microps, you have a second section in
[SPEAKER_01]: there for algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about algae?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm trying to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say to you that was the one
thing I left out of Team with Microps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wrote the book in 2006
originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is the revised edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And incidentally, on page 47, I think,
of the of the first edition of either the
[SPEAKER_00]: revised edition of the regular as well as
the audio, I reversed the definition of
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is low when you have lots of hydrogen
ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fungi tend to produce a lower pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria tend to produce a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I forgot your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: So algae has a couple of really kind of
neat properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps in forming soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a kind of organic food for
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it has a lot of
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, it's photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can be adding to the soil in
that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand it's in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in deserts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we tend to think algae,
hmm, algae, that's pond scum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's not in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a desert with algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they have these little pads of algae
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't encourage people to go
out and add algae to their garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you certainly could add it to your
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the best place to add
stuff is your compost pile and then add
[SPEAKER_00]: compost to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fall, incidentally, is in areas
where you plant in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fall is the time to make sure that
you've got a couple of inches of compost
[SPEAKER_00]: over your soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you are working the process and
feeding the soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these microbes are working their way
down into the soil and into the root zone
[SPEAKER_00]: during the fall and winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that by spring, you've got some
fertility back in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is important for gardeners,
if I could just add one other thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we really need to obey the law of
return.
[SPEAKER_00]: What falls down from a tree, for example,
is supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those leaves are supposed to decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They contain all the nutrients that the
plant sucked up out of the soil and they
[SPEAKER_00]: decay and go back into the soil again and
feed the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're farmers, we're gardeners,
we're growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We remove things from the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We violate the law of return.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to make sure that
you're adding stuff back into the system
[SPEAKER_00]: on a timely basis so that you don't have
to resort to chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing about algae that I wanted to
bring up, I actually have a quote here
[SPEAKER_01]: from your book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think a lot of people know
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I wanted to read it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put, quote, the cell walls of diatoms,
which is algae, are composed of silica
[SPEAKER_01]: covered with an organic skin that decays
and disappears after the organism dies,
[SPEAKER_01]: leaving behind, in huge numbers,
the silica skeletons that make up
[SPEAKER_01]: diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So algae, once it's dying off,
it's leaving behind silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a kind of algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are lots of different kinds
of algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, and not all of it does,
but certainly that does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that diatomaceous earth, do you ever
get a chance to look at that stuff under a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it has all these pore spaces and
it's just spectacular root condominium and
[SPEAKER_00]: provides a little bit of food and
substance and drainage and storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use it as either like a
preventative or to battle fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they keep it in there and it
helps tackle that population.
[SPEAKER_01]: But correct me if I'm wrong, that
diatomaceous earth, that's not really in a
[SPEAKER_01]: usable form that the plant can uptake,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be broken down by microbes in
order to be in, what, salicylic acid or
[SPEAKER_01]: orthosalicylic acid in order for the plant
to uptake?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it has to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go into ionic form in order for
it to be taken up by the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaming with Nutrients, the second book I
wrote.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first book really was designed to
explain the soil food, whereas we knew it
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how food gets to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it occurred to me one day after I
wrote the book that I had no idea how food
[SPEAKER_00]: gets inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's inside, what's it doing
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Teaming with Nutrients is about
that particular subject.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the take homes is the microbes
in the soil food web system break down the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients into the proper ionic form so
that they can get through that cell
[SPEAKER_00]: membrane, which is again, going back to my
tofu container, which is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: holding all of that tofu together in that
little tofu block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that membrane has little proteins in
it that act as tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are various different ways that
individual ions, nutrient ions can move
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each tunnel is specific for that one
kind of ion, which is really mind blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: when you think of something like,
you know, boron, just a teeny little bits
[SPEAKER_00]: used and the plant has to make that
protein and insert it into the membrane in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to be, ah, it's just, I mean,
we think plants are stupid and dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are unbelievable microcosms of earth
and what goes on in earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think we know a lot about plants
and soil biology, but we probably know a
[SPEAKER_01]: fraction of what's actually out there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I can tell you, I mean,
I would never have told you that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: be writing a book on Teaming with
Bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just wasn't even in the realm
even three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's at the point where we've
learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, certain plants have
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes have trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result of studying rhizophagy,
we now know that what's happening inside
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes is nitrogen fixation by
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the same kind of reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily get the stripping in
them, but you get multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get different chemicals being
produced, some of which are very wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals to lower the oxygen levels so
that the fixation can take place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know what's going on in those
factories, which we didn't know before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you take your tomato plant,
you know, and that smell comes from
[SPEAKER_00]: rubbing those trichomes, that's probably
some kind of a metabolite coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that are in those trichomes as
you crush them with your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't even gotten into the other
endophytic bacteria because some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria go in and then they're ejected
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these bacteria stay inside the
plant and move throughout the plant and do
[SPEAKER_00]: a number of things that benefit the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, as they go into the plant
and they cause the plant to spray this
[SPEAKER_00]: what's known as RO onto the bacteria to
strip those walls, the plant goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, wait a minute, I better strengthen my
own cell wall or I'm going to be stripping
[SPEAKER_00]: my cell walls by mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it increases its strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better able to handle stress as a
result of the bacteria invasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these bacteria produce phytohormones,
gibberellic acid, auxins, all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that ethylene all the things that you want
to have a good healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are inside the plant producing
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it gets even wilder.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a phyllosphere around the leaves,
which is like the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the area around the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the bacteria get into that area and
they get trapped into the seed coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the plant seed germinates in
new soil, it brings with it the kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that are beneficial to that
particular plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the past five or 10 years,
farmers in particular and in the book,
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we're going to start getting more
gardeners and growers have been using
[SPEAKER_00]: various different kinds of bacteria to fix
nitrogen inside the plant and to do all
[SPEAKER_00]: sorts of really cool things for the plant
to help it be stronger and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are known as endophytic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that these medicinal growers use is
azospirillium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a spore form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a fairly long shelf life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a mix of five or six bacteria
that people can use to get benefits out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what the plant is,
different bacteria impact the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a difference for some plants
when you use vermicompost versus using
[SPEAKER_00]: thermocompost because there's a different
bacterial base in either one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to overwhelm people with
all of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise you, if you pick up Teeming
with Microbes and read it and don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what I'm talking about,
I'll buy that book back from you three
[SPEAKER_00]: times the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, nobody's ever taken me up because,
and it's not me, it's the subject matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have the vocabulary and
understand the system, and it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: just the little guy getting eaten by a
bigger guy, getting eaten by a bigger guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those populations doing in there
before they get eaten?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really simple stuff and really easy
to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will finish the book and you will
never garden the same again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely mind blown off of a lot
of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The endophytic bacteria are also called
endophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is what a mycorrhizal fungi is,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an endophyte.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that it can be purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the application rate, is it something
that's sprayed onto the plant as like a
[SPEAKER_01]: foiler or is it actually a soil drench?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones I've seen are drenches,
but I'm sure they're sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has lots of implications for
people who are growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if the plant is bringing to the
soil the bacteria that it needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, doesn't that mean maybe we should be
reusing our soil, not throwing it away?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's full of bacteria that we
need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've got to make sure that the law
of return has been taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But why do people throw away soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the craziest thing I ever heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even pulling up a tomato plant out of a
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut the plant, you plant right there,
leave the roots where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They form channels that have organic
material that decay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the right bacteria right there
in the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots of the new plant will grow
down into those little tubes and benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from all of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so much we can learn by
just listening to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we have to listen with
microscopes and we have to have people
[SPEAKER_00]: like James White and Elaine Ingham do this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't invent this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I do is report it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hat's off to these people who have
really, I think, changed the tenor of
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started gardening with my dad,
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sterilize soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we know growers that sterilize
seeds today.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you start seeds, your tomato seeds
in a paper towel situation, you don't just
[SPEAKER_00]: take the little new seedling and put it in
the soil because there are bacteria that
[SPEAKER_00]: jumped off that seed that are in the paper
towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bury the paper towel too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start to think more logically,
what is the plant doing and how can we
[SPEAKER_00]: help the plant do that as opposed to using
chemicals, which we haven't really talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about when you use chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are now proven studies that using
chemicals reduces the bacteria and the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use organics, you increase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's all I need to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the book at the time,
in 2006, when Teaming with Micro was
[SPEAKER_00]: written, basically the discussion was that
some of these chemicals killed the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on in the revised edition,
it was some kill, some increased
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and changed the ratio of the
populations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not what the plant wants
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put down XYZ fertilizer and all of a
sudden you get a lot more XYZ bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: than you necessarily want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the natural system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one fertilizes the forest that you go
and spend time in.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one fertilizes the redwoods,
I like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody put the fertilizers down there and
spray them with herbicides and chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did it themselves because they use
the microbial system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the basis of regenerative gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the basis of no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where you want to start,
folks, if you don't know anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know about some of it already,
you want to continually use the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: to continually update the information
because we're learning more and more all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned throwing away soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the reason why a lot of people do
that is because they are using chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're worried about the balance of ions
being off balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an excess of some cations,
it's going to lock out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to prevent the uptake of other
cations, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gross pH too, same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a really bad pH in all of the
soil, it's going to lock up a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the folks that are using chemicals and
switching over toward organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're saying they could probably rehab
that soil that they use chemicals in.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd throw it in a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw it in a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You let the compost microbes take care of
the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to leave the subject without
mentioning that you can use too much
[SPEAKER_00]: organic material as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time of year, I wish to tell I write
a garden column.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell my readers, an inch or two
of compost, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do raised beds in compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got too much phosphorous in it,
phosphates, and a lot of them are locked
[SPEAKER_00]: up, of course, but it changes the whole
tenor of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a little bit, the plant will take
what it needs, but you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Goldilocks rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that just simply
say there's no science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I've always had great success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've turned my lawn green using compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the tenor of the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't like the idea of compost tea,
use compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the point of the compost tea
would be to multiply the microbes in that
[SPEAKER_01]: tea faster than you would with just adding
compost in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're multiplying it, whereas you can
make a leachate by taking the compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into a bag and squeezing it in
a bucket of nice warm water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get microbes from the compost
there, but they just won't multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to feed them and aerate them to
get the multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's very hard to find great
scientific studies to say it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet, when I do my side-by-side with
cilantro and different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: holy crow, I haven't used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just my imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: With composting, I just started
vermicomposting last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding, there can be bad
bacteria in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to worry about that, making sure
you're composting correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about good bacteria
versus bad bacteria and how to avoid the
[SPEAKER_01]: bad bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about vermicomposting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no thermal activity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff is going through the worm and
the worm is cleaning the stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take the stuff when it's too young,
some of the castings won't be the way you
[SPEAKER_00]: want them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermicast, I always let my stuff go for
about six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermal compost is a different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the heat and the cycling that takes
care of the bad guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes anaerobic and stays anaerobic,
if you don't turn it the right way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have pockets of anaerobic stuff
depending on what you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: As your base material, if you're going
around the neighborhood and picking up
[SPEAKER_00]: black bags of leaves that people leave in
the curb in the fall without checking to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that they don't have a dog,
you may be putting manure in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use fish guts and
different kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to make sure that it's composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are studies that indicate that many,
many yard composters don't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: thoroughly compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're compost and so they may end up
with different things on it that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaerobic bacteria is what E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bad guys tend to be anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that you're turning
it, that it's getting to the heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: that all parts of it are being turned and
get to the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that your inputs are
known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to use horse manure,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got tetracycline in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want that tetracycline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any possibility that any would be left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to pay attention or you just
pile it up and leave it there for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of years and you'll have some great
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The easy way, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on bokashi
composting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the leachate from the bokashi but
you got to take the stuff and put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: pile at some point in time anyway,
to me, to finish the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Korean natural farm, all that stuff,
it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to be anaerobic but they use
lactic acid and the same stuff that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: yogurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people team differently than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then for the earthworms, I want to get a
little bit deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, for vermicomposting or even
people just having worms in their bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: can you talk to us about the earthworms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific type that they should
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got red wigglers, African night
crawlers, European night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a variety that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always use the red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're worried about now is that new
worm that's beginning to pop up all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: That little band that's around it is
different than the earthworm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworms that we're used to,
these guys move like crazy and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: very destructive to the duff layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already got a problem with fishermen
who go fishing with even red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Michigan and they don't catch
anything because they don't live where I
[SPEAKER_00]: live in Alaska, which has got all the
great fishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They throw their fishing worms out at the
end of the day as they're going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: their car.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those worms multiply and they eat the
duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they mess up the mycorrhizal
symbiosis and we end up with some serious
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be careful what you use.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, I use vermicompost in a
vermicompost bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big one on throwing worms
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll come if your soil is good,
if you live in an area that has worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people in the United States
do live in an area that has worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oddly enough, when I first came to Alaska,
we really basically didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still get letters from readers and
emails that say, what are these little
[SPEAKER_00]: lumps in my lawn?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those lumps are vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are castings, worm castings,
not really compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: What goes through a worm concentrates the
nutrients, X more times nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: X more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a phenomenal opportunity to
enrich or concentrate nutrients in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: People I know used to throw night crawlers
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your worms to be in a bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms will get into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that I really
encourage.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are getting towards the end of the
episode here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of things I like to close out on
would be advice for new gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything maybe we haven't
talked about in this episode that you
[SPEAKER_01]: think should be brought up or advice for
new gardeners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, and of course, it's
self-serving, but read teaming with
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't understand the soil food web
teaming with microbes, I think the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States Department of Agriculture,
Dr. Elaine wrote a little picture booklet
[SPEAKER_00]: about the soil food web, very simplistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look on the internet if you don't want to
buy a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read about the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how your plans work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't start with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're being yelled at by some
Scotch guy every spring to do X,
[SPEAKER_00]: Y, and Z.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people tell you that glyphosate's
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not something that you want to be
fooling around with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be an organic gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be a natural gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The work comes when you have to convert
from a chemical situation to an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: situation, which ultimately is where
you're going to want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to the supermarket,
do you buy chemical-laden apples?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you buy chemical-laden fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you buy organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: You buy organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to grow your own organic as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so easy to do because the plant is in
charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the plant to balance what it
needs, your inputs water, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water and then the compost as well that
you have to add in every once in a while?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or different kinds of mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use mulches which are compost in
the making, but one or the other you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no bare soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't roll out till.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks up the soil food web and
displaces members of the soil food web
[SPEAKER_00]: that are supposed to be in one zone to
another zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a long time for them to get back
into the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It messes up the mycorrhizal network
that's been created in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, what I'm saying to you is if you
start out knowing what the soil food web
[SPEAKER_00]: is, it's going to be really easy to start
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go chemical, you got to figure out
what those chemicals do, how much to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much to measure, when to use them,
when not to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really makes gardening work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not supposed to be work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to be a wonderful hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrapping things up, how can the listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to be writing any
more books, but that's what I said after
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'll tell you what.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: JeffLohanFels.com is my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to email me, you can do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email is not hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of different things that
you ought to be looking at other than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up the soil food web and learn about
it from as many different sources as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then teaming with bacteria and your new
book now released.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually put a link to your book down in
the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just search for it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need it in different foreign
languages, all of them have been
[SPEAKER_00]: translated, available in audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I don't know this next one,
I don't know if they're going to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do an audio on it because it has so
many bacterial names and they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do that as you read the
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go by them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should definitely take a look at these
books.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at the reviews on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: See whether they'll be helpful for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, I'll definitely have a
link to your book down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link that down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, subscribe to the channel if you

[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend, I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love for you to tune in to future
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff, thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been insightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of things here that
you had mentioned today that my audience
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to take away and definitely gain
some value from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a pleasure to be on Mr. Crowett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
