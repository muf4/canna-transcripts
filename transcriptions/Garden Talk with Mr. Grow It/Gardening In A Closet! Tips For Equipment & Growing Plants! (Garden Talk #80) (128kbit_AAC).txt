[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk, it's really
cheap and simple to to just build whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: frame and size you want You know get your
extractor choose your lights and then boom
[SPEAKER_00]: I use what's available and one of the
first things available when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started growing again in Colombia was five
gallon paint buckets But like not used
[SPEAKER_00]: with paint so there's no toxicities or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go buy a paint bucket It's like
three bucks or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, it's so much better than
going to the gardening store They're like
[SPEAKER_00]: ten bucks or something here If you're all
still a little bit early in that flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're seeing a lot of stretch on the
main stretchers if you need to Do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit LST just a little bit to slow her down
and if you have to take those two top four
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever suckers Just you know slow them
down just a little bit with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of low stress training This is a way to be
able to have your own medicine produce it
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself on a consistent basis in an
organic way where you actually know what
[SPEAKER_00]: is inside your medicine and You get to
choose it

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the garden talk podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am joined with Dakota from home grow TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today, dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic, what an honor to be on the show
Mr. Grow it my bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I call you Chris now that you know,
we get to hang out virtue like this for
[SPEAKER_00]: the first time of course Absolutely,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thanks again, bro for having me on
yeah I'm excited for you to be on here and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the topic we're gonna talk about
today is something that excites me because
[SPEAKER_01]: it hasn't really been talked about on my
podcast yet, which is Closet growing but
[SPEAKER_01]: really we're gonna be talking about like
growing in small spaces as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not just closet growing but some
people don't have a closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just growing in a small space
We'll get all into that because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: really some things that you can do
Differently than you would do in a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: growth space So kind of narrowing it down
specifically to those small grow spaces
[SPEAKER_01]: closet growing I think is gonna be
valuable to the audience But first can you
[SPEAKER_01]: do an introduction to tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Dakota originally from
Edmonton Alberta in Canada right now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: living here in near Medell√≠n, Colombia
That's a long story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know originally Canadian at heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, you know love it I think a lot
of people notice I'm Canadian when they
[SPEAKER_00]: start hear me talking they my boats still
come out quite a bit and my journey into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and finding this medicinal plant
is actually quite interesting and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool to be able to come on here
today and be able to share it because You
[SPEAKER_00]: know the format that I get to share on
YouTube and stuff We don't really go into
[SPEAKER_00]: my backstory so often and getting to do a
few interviews myself It's not getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into the backstory of homegrownTV And how
we got here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really cool to to be able to dive
into that and what makes it so different
[SPEAKER_00]: is the fact of like kind of like the age I
got into it at and how How I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: finding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually my what I call my stepdad,
you know, my mother's boyfriend at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and I was 16 17 and I had started to
have my first kind of relationship with
[SPEAKER_00]: you know The medicinal side of it and
starting to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suffered a lot at a young age of
migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be like hardcore once a month
and this was like it'd be either a full
[SPEAKER_00]: one day or if not a two three day migraine
and My mom didn't know at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I ended up finding this, you know to
be a solution and I came back from a trip
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was 16 years old and I go into the
basement and my stepdad shows me this
[SPEAKER_00]: little wooden closet and it was built out
of a wooden frame and he said this system
[SPEAKER_00]: right here when I'm about to show you and
I had no idea what's inside and like talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about a you know, a buildup of Of what's
to come and he's just like telling me the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules first like what I'm about to show
you this is a way to be able to have your
[SPEAKER_00]: own medicine and produce it for yourself
on a consistent basis in an organic way
[SPEAKER_00]: where you actually know what is inside
your medicine and You get to choose it and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, okay What is in this box,
you know, and so it was with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: screw drill and he undrills it and it
opens up and I just see like a row of six
[SPEAKER_00]: little plants and they had these little
white pistols coming out and I had never
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the plant in that form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just head over I've always seen it in
its final cured form, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't edgy This was my first entrance
into seeing this this format So my entry
[SPEAKER_00]: into the to the growing world was actually
through, you know through family and
[SPEAKER_00]: showing me step by step and it was books
like You know the grow Bible or Jorge
[SPEAKER_00]: Cervantes, you know course I got you know
took him through those steps by steps but
[SPEAKER_00]: in person and given that book and given
that course and like the first thing ever
[SPEAKER_00]: in my hands that was the first like year
and a half was that little that little
[SPEAKER_00]: closet grow and it was a three little step
Formula and it was really like a two by
[SPEAKER_00]: six is what it was and this was you know
your flower Your veg in your mom room and
[SPEAKER_00]: your clone room up top and it was like
little t5 bulbs for you know for the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones and I didn't know any of these
things and he was just showing me the
[SPEAKER_00]: system and he was like the first thing
also he's like that same day here's your
[SPEAKER_00]: journal you write down everything you do
to these beautiful plants and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that goes into them and you write down any
signs from here on out and This is now,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like immediately just took to
such a beautiful hobby to see them change
[SPEAKER_00]: from the first day I seen them then go in
the next day for a week later immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it very seriously and I seen the
you know the impacts of The way you treat,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this plants and what comes out of
it after oh my god that first harvest was
[SPEAKER_00]: the most insane thing You know that that
I've ever seen still today and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: remember it clear as day That was kind of
that the grow getting getting into my
[SPEAKER_00]: first kind of experience with closet grows
and that from there that same technique
[SPEAKER_00]: went into grow Slightly bigger spaces,
but it was always still building our own
[SPEAKER_00]: wood Frames white reflective poly,
you know grow tens wasn't something I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of yet or seen LEDs was something
only seen in high times magazine Hps was
[SPEAKER_00]: the light we were using then for
everything veg was just t5s those nice
[SPEAKER_00]: little thin balls that we just put on a
nice little panel and it was a lot of D
[SPEAKER_00]: You know do-it-yourself building,
you know working with wood and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it But that was getting that respect
and understanding for creating your own
[SPEAKER_00]: environment in a small space And that's
why I thought the topic today was so good
[SPEAKER_00]: to dive more into the small space Closet
grow Compared to I do have you know
[SPEAKER_00]: experience with bigger tents and bigger
grows then but that's what started it all
[SPEAKER_00]: and I still to date now always have you
know, the small two by fours or clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: closet style grows because I just found
the importance number one of controlling
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment and then the ease of
doing it in the smaller space learning
[SPEAKER_00]: there was was gave me great, you know kind
of Foundation to go to a you know from
[SPEAKER_00]: there I think we're building enough for 20
plants and into something a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger and that was a totally different
space But the little that what you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: in just a closet size built, you know by
yourself at home and help is
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sustaining You know perpetual harvest
that absolutely blew my mind It's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: cool to hear your story about how you
started and starting with a small space
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of working away up into bigger
space So you have experience in bolt types
[SPEAKER_01]: of environments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool to hear I have to ask
how did the whole YouTube thing come about
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're real known for your YouTube
channel called homegrown TV, I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely have a link to it down in the
YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: You currently have 21,000 subscribers on
your channel and I must say your video
[SPEAKER_01]: production is Insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you're up there with the best of
the best as far as video production
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing everybody up to the next level
and as far as video production How did
[SPEAKER_01]: that all come about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's a great question that
follows up through that was my again
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into and Finding what it was like
to grow finding how easy it was to be
[SPEAKER_00]: self-sustaining with your own medicinal,
you know Plants at home that eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up coming to a full stop when I get
into again I was so young when I got into
[SPEAKER_00]: it I continued that till about you know 18
19 years old worked a few construction
[SPEAKER_00]: jobs and then I actually was blessed
enough to have a friend who also worked
[SPEAKER_00]: construction and he got into the world of
affiliate marketing online marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: internet marketing and this was back in
like 2011 and 12 when I decided at 19
[SPEAKER_00]: years old I'm gonna get into affiliate
marketing and I'm not sure if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar with with authors like Tim
Ferriss The for our work week and and
[SPEAKER_00]: these different people in the
self-development world that was one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: first books I read was a for our work week
and I've learned about geo arbitrage where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting paid in US dollars Canadian
dollars and then spending that in
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere else so at 19 years old I went
to Thailand and I was barely making any
[SPEAKER_00]: money online But it was gonna be more than
more than it was worth in in in Canada So
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the risk and I went with my buddy
and it ended up really snowballing and
[SPEAKER_00]: turning into more income That I could have
thought of at that time more freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what got me to Colombia as well in
2013 We did nine months in Thailand and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I came out to Colombia for just three
months That was my plan and that was 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: now we are in what 2022 I'm still here
absolutely loving it, you know traveling
[SPEAKER_00]: out of here often but this is my home base
here in Colombia and since then in 2016 I
[SPEAKER_00]: made a transition into filmmaking and it
was a lot in the advertising Filming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketing world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an affiliate marketer the best way
to sell A lot of my products at 19 was to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a video, you know driving and this
is like back when Facebook marketing was
[SPEAKER_00]: like just the right side banner ad with a
photo and then you click on it and they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: go to like email and then video wasn't
even a thing yet on Facebook and so when
[SPEAKER_00]: it did become a thing that was like I got
to learn this about Final Cut Pro in 2013
[SPEAKER_00]: as well and I would just slowly do my
marketing videos and I found that on
[SPEAKER_00]: Sundays which was my free day I was
editing videos to like 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of like me traveling and all these like
just random things just trying to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: the skill of editing and I sat down myself
in 2016 and that's like that's the blessed
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I why I continue to love this plan
so much because it was because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: plan and on a creative session Just
sitting there thinking analyzing my life I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like what would life look like if
that's all you did if all you did was
[SPEAKER_00]: create film So in 2016 I made a big risk
and just started working in the video
[SPEAKER_00]: world learning the skill set putting in
the time What is editing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the basics of camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then oh my goodness a pretty much
pandemic I or Or the whole COVID thing
[SPEAKER_00]: started in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had been working in film now just for a
little bit I could no longer travel to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the clients that I needed to go to in
the events the way I used to work and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: created Homegrown TV and I was like dang
man What if I did the same amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: effort everything I was put into my
clients work their commercial work that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and we just did it with this
beautiful thing that I used to do and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had stopped growing for eight plus years
Traveling client work, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I didn't know in Columbia you could
even grow 20 plants legally Everyone here
[SPEAKER_00]: by by residents by household is legally
allowed to grow 20 medicinal plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: their house with no said license So when I
found that out and this was again just
[SPEAKER_00]: around right before COVID-19 I was like
I'm gonna create the channel and just
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly again at that transition from
working with client work and marketing to
[SPEAKER_00]: doing Homegrown TV Which really I would
say six to eight months ago is I'm like I
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to go full-time I just want to
hang out with these ladies film them see
[SPEAKER_00]: him go from seed to harvest document that
part so that's that's kind of where The
[SPEAKER_00]: the filming and the production value comes
from from the Homegrown TV side and the
[SPEAKER_00]: storytelling from that past Experience I
had is creating marketing videos and and
[SPEAKER_00]: filmmaking in that world.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome Wow So coming up on ten
years video editing total since you said
[SPEAKER_01]: he started in 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no wonder why you're so good Yeah,
that's why I really do love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So transitioning over to growing you
talked a little bit about what your growth
[SPEAKER_01]: style is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you also do outdoor growing as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic a mineral based or often called
synthetic and what medium you in a you
[SPEAKER_00]: soil great question hydroponic systems So
being here in Colombia, it's crazy to say
[SPEAKER_00]: this but I'm 100% indoor right now here in
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 365 all year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 1212 light It's perfect conditions
for outdoor and some of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grows in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're based out of here That's why I see
these major companies now coming down from
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada, you know from all around the world
really Licensing land and moving in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Do we do it yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and that's mostly just because of the
property I live on I cannot wait That's my
[SPEAKER_00]: goal within the next year to get to a
place where I can have ten outside
[SPEAKER_00]: beauties and then ten inside again limited
to 20 without going to to get a license so
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% indoor right now, but cannot wait to
get outdoor the medium we use is I Started
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is trial and error here in Colombia,
dude It's so much different than back when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Canada what's available,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't go get what I what I
originally learned with so it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: learning Curve the first year here and I
have a great grow bro that you see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: on the channel His name is mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Q.
[SPEAKER_00]: He runs a company here out of Colombia He
has been growing like a year more than or
[SPEAKER_00]: more than that here in Colombia So he had
his his company down, you know his feet
[SPEAKER_00]: down and he's like dude Go to cocoa and
it's like it cost me ten bucks for like a
[SPEAKER_00]: big bull to like a big coffee or like a
big potato sack 40 kilograms Ten bucks for
[SPEAKER_00]: that and it cost me ten bucks for a big
bag of castings earthworm castings another
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 kilos just huge and so I follow his
formula what he taught me and I play
[SPEAKER_00]: between just cocoa 50-50 with the castings
and it's not the same quality castings
[SPEAKER_00]: again that I would be used to in Canada
that you might find in the States It
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't it's not like just pure like all
this is just you know worm poop like you
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell it's a little bit of earth still
but there's a lot of great minerals in
[SPEAKER_00]: there so I usually play between a 70 cocoa
to 30 we call hummus castings or 50-50
[SPEAKER_00]: playing anywhere between those those kind
of ratios and then for nutrients What's
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool at home go to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always just testing new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done a six-month cycle with Mills
nutrients You know, we did a year cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: with an organic line nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is actually my grow bros Nutrient
line and it just a scene for me to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: again to get my feet wet and see okay That
was a difference between this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running cutting edge Split with
crunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're testing at different times and
we're never just running through like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, just one grow test We're gonna run
everything for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see How it works and then from there
we'll decide do we move on and test more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are we gonna stick with these ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're almost getting to the
point where I'm just like, okay I've tried
[SPEAKER_00]: enough for like let's just hang low for
like a year two years and just run this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and start to dial it in more now
with with the plants and see how they're
[SPEAKER_01]: reacting gotcha, okay, and You mentioned
that you started in a small grow space
[SPEAKER_01]: really your your closet is framed in I
guess right you started in a framed area
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of people in the Similar
situation to you where they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually create a framed grow space That's
my real round closet size or it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: even smaller than that Talk to us in
detail about how you went about framing it
[SPEAKER_01]: even getting into the details on like what
size would you used I think you used
[SPEAKER_01]: either Would use the panda film on mylar
so on and so forth Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question, dude I love that you're
bringing me back to that time and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: really hope I said that watches us at some
point because what great times those were
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'd say like The best way for people
listening to this or maybe watching this
[SPEAKER_00]: right now And thinking about building your
first one at home and like you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: see someone do it I would go search out
Jorge Cervantes and like that original
[SPEAKER_00]: grow course He shows you how to frame out
a room and the way we would do it is we
[SPEAKER_00]: would look at the space So the first
whenever okay, I know I have about this
[SPEAKER_00]: much and we framed it about two by six and
Again in Canada, it's very typical in most
[SPEAKER_00]: garages in your household You're gonna
have power tools if not someone's parents
[SPEAKER_00]: or friends someone's gonna have power
tools if not, you would go rent somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first moved out, that's what we go
do the Home Depot We'd rent what we needed
[SPEAKER_00]: and we just do a day cutting measure
everything out and very simple framework
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really just talking like
just you know, two by four is cut to the
[SPEAKER_00]: size You know drilled together with with
your power drill Depending on how big we
[SPEAKER_00]: went then obviously we'd have side braces
and brace it a few more But Jorge
[SPEAKER_00]: Cervantes does it great bro in that
old-school grainy film I think it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube as well and he's up there and
they're just you know They're hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they're getting it up and what
we would use I don't know the name But I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew it as black and white poly and I
don't know if it was made for construction
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it was a gardening thing But I'm
pretty sure I would get it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening store back then and that wasn't
something I would get at Home Depot I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't remember specifically but it was
black on one side white on the other and
[SPEAKER_00]: then what I liked about and I still like
about the idea of building your own size
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room you can tailor it to your own
size, you know, and so when I First and
[SPEAKER_00]: did my grow my my grow on my own outside,
you know without my stepdad Taking me step
[SPEAKER_00]: by step.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went a bit bigger and we just custom
built it to whatever a basement was
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing Okay, we just space out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a track and a 600 watt HPS going
back and forth at the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, okay, we'll put maybe two or
three 20 in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, perfect And then so we just you know
framed it out custom with that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the poly with a little stapler stapling it
up You seal it, you know, you cut your
[SPEAKER_00]: hole where your ventilation is gonna be
very it's exactly what the tents are today
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's why it's it's crazy too to see
the how Easy the kits are you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in the bottom and you choose where
you want to open up the flaps We were
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the same thing before I even knew
that existed and I'm just like wow,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro Like I'm just so fortunate that I was
taught that way at the beginning and not
[SPEAKER_00]: just throw it in the closet without You
know sealing in some kind of way having an
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor You know bringing the fresh air
in not knowing that just planting beans if
[SPEAKER_00]: that was my experience getting into the
game I think I don't even know if
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown TV would be around now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really nice to learn the basics So,
you know, it's cool to even see People use
[SPEAKER_00]: a closet they might not even seal it with
black and white sometimes but they do have
[SPEAKER_00]: an extractor going out they got things
coming in they know no lights going into
[SPEAKER_00]: that room maybe so there's ways to do
without sealing it but It's really cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: and simple to to just build whatever frame
and size you want, you know get your
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor Choose your lights and then boom
for the poly film.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's also called panda film I'm
not sure if it's a brand panda or what but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah that stuff You know for anyone
listening in that's looking to purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different sizes Of thickness and
some are so thin that you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: hold up to a light and you can see the
light right through it So it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful that you're looking at the
thickness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the standard thickness is five mil
I think the happy hydro actually has the
[SPEAKER_01]: thickest on the market seven mil So if
you're really looking for a real thick one
[SPEAKER_01]: a product placement here happy hydro show
to you guys I actually have some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I used for my closet seven mil
thick on that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's solid now What about lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you use for lighting back then
and?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking a look back.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you recommend now for lighting and
space like that since back then the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting was a lot different than it is
today Yeah, dude HPS was our main go-to
[SPEAKER_00]: for flower back in the day And I loved
those t5s like I would even bring them
[SPEAKER_00]: back now just those small fluorescent
little T5 balls were so cheap and we would
[SPEAKER_00]: get custom and build panels with like ten
of them on there You know, they would
[SPEAKER_00]: barely, you know use up anything and I
remember even doing a full grow from seed
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest with just those to see and I
was like blown away with like oh my god It
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produced nugs as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought just HPS was going to do that
But no HPS was really nice back in day,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in Canada in the winter,
bro It gets really really cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice to have that heat At
certain times definitely during the winter
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't in the summer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in a basement So it was it was
nice and cool and yeah the great results
[SPEAKER_00]: But now like especially with where I live
now and being in Columbia and even if I
[SPEAKER_00]: was still in Canada LED I just really big
fan of LED because of the heat The
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency is so nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like something for everyone's grow
style So it's like some people really into
[SPEAKER_00]: the bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people love the panels, you know,
and it's just it's just really cool to see
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's come and you know, we're always
just testing as well different things here
[SPEAKER_00]: on on the channel on home grow TV and it's
just we found some really, you know
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing, you know, just amazing results
with I remember the first time I tried a
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 watt LED and I was like I just you
know and in a two by fours Which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great example and keeping the environment
small It was just 200 watts the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: I ever tried one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I wasn't expecting You know
what I see on Instagram these 700 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt LEDs crazy nugs,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was unbelievable I was like,
oh my god, I just blew away my
[SPEAKER_00]: expectations You know if you just have it
dialed in nice and have everything turned
[SPEAKER_00]: in nice and with those small tents I find
it's it's easy to dial in the the perfect
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's all you really need for a
wattage these days You know can be very
[SPEAKER_01]: very low I mean for a two by two space a
lot of people put a hundred watts of LED
[SPEAKER_01]: in there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know two by four space two hundred
watts now you can go above and beyond that
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure But then you could potentially
run into heat issues You know with all
[SPEAKER_01]: that energy consumption being drawn the
heat coming from the diode being in that
[SPEAKER_01]: small space that can be difficult Yeah,
let's get into air exchange air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulation First what's your ventilation
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked a little bit about an extractor
fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a particular brand fan You're
using to exhaust the air are using carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: filter to so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah ventilation I think that's a
perfect question for the timing that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: just recently going through right now
because It was two or three episodes ago
[SPEAKER_00]: on the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We released something on powdery mildew
It's the first time that's ever happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to me and I got hit hard on like to my
tents Because in in Canada, I always took
[SPEAKER_00]: it for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a much drier climates and I
remember not having to fight with 80 90
[SPEAKER_00]: percent humidity is like I have here so I
was like one of my fans broke and this was
[SPEAKER_00]: a I Won't mention the name, but it wasn't
a brand It was it was like the cheapest
[SPEAKER_00]: one I could find on Amazon an extractor
and it broke down I didn't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: replacement so I connected one tent to the
other tent to the two by four So they
[SPEAKER_00]: would extract both and then go out So I'm
bringing powdery mildew from one into the
[SPEAKER_00]: other which I didn't know and then it's
all on the on the Channel on the episode I
[SPEAKER_00]: learned so much and so I definitely
respect More now and is something we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know but I didn't know the consequences
until I was dealing with powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: now I know it has to be on point and the
main one that I'm absolutely loving is The
[SPEAKER_00]: AC infinity because of the the monitoring
like to get to see The the humidity that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in there getting to adjust the probe and
not having like an external little one I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely loving and now having the
Bluetooth ones I don't have the Wi-Fi,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have the new Bluetooth and their
advanced setup And it's so cool to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it on my phone have alerts set up
and everything So for me, that's my go-to
[SPEAKER_00]: now and I don't think I'll invest in
anything else That's not going to be at
[SPEAKER_00]: least at that level to be able to see now
It's going a monitor for my phone monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: from an event just in case something does
you know totally Have an error stop
[SPEAKER_00]: working which you know, and all the time
I've been growing That's the first time a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan ever failed like that, but it was
enough to totally mess up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: two beautiful tents and Yeah, dude AC
infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely loving them right now and
please please everyone listening to this
[SPEAKER_00]: or watching this Don't make the same
mistake I do or I did it won't happen
[SPEAKER_00]: again on the channel But yeah,
take your extraction your ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously inside the rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had clip fans But I've found a
lot of the clip fans I've worked with in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past or I've used have never had the
power I wanted to but I'm finding the new
[SPEAKER_00]: AC infinity ones which I also have like
they have the oscillating ones which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely loving and the other ones also
getting to set the power and control the
[SPEAKER_00]: power for my phone and everything it just
giving me a whole new realm of Control and
[SPEAKER_00]: like kind of freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to see how that reflects
the grows I'm doing my first test and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest with with those setups right now
But yeah, if I don't on the other tents
[SPEAKER_00]: where I don't have the nice oscillating
ACs I'll run, you know a nice big from the
[SPEAKER_00]: home center like the Home Depot Center big
fan up in the corner one down below and if
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to maybe another one just to make
sure everything's kind of somewhat dancing
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room not breakdancing and get nuts
but just slightly kind of just moving back
[SPEAKER_00]: and forth and Say no to powdery mildew
Yeah, the air circulation is so
[SPEAKER_01]: undervalued by so many people and a lot of
people don't have their fans set up the
[SPEAKER_01]: way they should so their flows as it
should and a lot of people have Real dense
[SPEAKER_01]: canopies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's hot spots at humid spots and be
a air circulation in order for it to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the co2 that it needs now AC infinity
They've certainly done so much in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: make things a lot easier for indoor
growing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing AC infinity doesn't have though,
which maybe I'll have in the future who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows is Heating and cooling so some
people will run heaters in their
[SPEAKER_01]: environment or some type of air
conditioning whether it be the standalone
[SPEAKER_01]: ones or the central AC in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you Do for heating and cooling
dude?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and that question to it they I can't
wait till they do it because the main
[SPEAKER_00]: question and me as a as a You know a
consumer of AC infinity I remember the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time seeing it and making my order
on on Getting my first inline fan or
[SPEAKER_00]: extractor fan and I was like, is it AC
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it is it producing AC out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it making cold air?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like going on the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, where's the AC in this thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would totally didn't know at the
beginning, but I can't wait for that to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out when I lived in the city of
Medellin, which right now I'm only about a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hour outside and Columbia is the
second most biodiverse country in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say it's the first some say it's a
third There's a it's a you know between
[SPEAKER_00]: Brazil you got Peru here But it's up there
meaning if I drive a half hour this way It
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a lot hotter and sometimes more
humid if I go half hour that way it can
[SPEAKER_00]: get colder and I'm like I need I need a
jacket on with just a half hour just the
[SPEAKER_00]: elevation it's in the mountains here so
just being in the city where I was a few
[SPEAKER_00]: months ago eight months ago, I think is
back when I lived out there It would get
[SPEAKER_00]: way too hot in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I needed an AC would get it would get
like 32 Which I'm not good at Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot, you know, it was a few degrees
too hot of my optimal Where I wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I would have to run it at night and
even running it at night I had to keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: lights low because if not, it was just
gonna be too warm unless I had AC Moving a
[SPEAKER_00]: half hour to where I live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just and this was part of the
decision of why I moved here I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, if I'm gonna take it serious,
it's gonna be a big investment You know AC
[SPEAKER_00]: all year with the amount of test rooms
that I want to do And stuff that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be pricey if we go half hour over there
here at night, it gets cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cooler here in general It can be a
little bit more humid But right now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect like the hottest I'll get is 25
degrees and then I turn them off in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day and it sits at 22 So my range is now
like three degrees on any tent pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: from day to night Being able to crank to
100 on the lights that I do want to so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really blessed being able to choose Okay,
let's just move a little bit over here and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of control it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So If I didn't though, yeah, I would be
using AC and a lot of people here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia use AC which has its own
advantages You know as far as keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity down working in some of those
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish You know, maybe I had a curing room
with AC in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be really cool Goals,
you know, maybe one day we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just my cure room has AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be amazing But no for now keeping
the energy bill as low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: No AC One thing I just want to add to that
would be for air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a concern for a lot of people
especially in small spaces, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Closets, you're not gonna be able to
really fit a standalone one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: portable AC units in your closet They're
just too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you probably could but you wouldn't
have much space left for a plant Of
[SPEAKER_01]: course, it depends on the size of your
closet If you had a huge walk-in closet,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you could probably fit in a portable
AC But one thing to keep in mind is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they consume so much energy the standalone
portable ones so much energy I had one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those for a while and I was using it and
my energy bill just went through the roof
[SPEAKER_01]: now the window ACs are gonna be a little
bit More efficient but by far the central
[SPEAKER_01]: ACs in the house and that's what I use now
is just the central AC in my house I just
[SPEAKER_01]: lower it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll freeze a little bit if needed Yeah,
but as long as my plants are happy that is
[SPEAKER_01]: most forgiving on the energy pill for sure
So I just figure I add that in and then
[SPEAKER_01]: for heating one thing I just want to speak
about is a lot of people use those
[SPEAKER_01]: portable heaters and I have one of those
tower heaters I use that all the time same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with your AC is it might not fit in
that gross space comfortably But having
[SPEAKER_01]: your equipment outside of the grow space
in your lung room like the room that your
[SPEAKER_01]: closet is in for example If you're
controlling the air in that room and then
[SPEAKER_01]: once you have your exhaust fan on you're
bringing that air in Well, you're bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ideal air, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The the temperature and humidity that
you've it's been conditioned in your lung
[SPEAKER_01]: room is coming into your grow room So just
forget mention those few things now How
[SPEAKER_01]: about humidifier and dehumidifier a lot of
people adjusting the relative humidity in
[SPEAKER_01]: order?
[SPEAKER_01]: To get into that optimal range for plant
growth by using a humidifier or
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier at all Yeah, great point and
especially being in those in a small tent
[SPEAKER_00]: closet grow two by four or anything bigger
than that It's you know talking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: last issue that I did have with the
powdery mill dude now that'll never happen
[SPEAKER_00]: again And so talking about the two by
fours, for example Again, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes my favorite just because I can
control the environment so easily and like
[SPEAKER_00]: I have small dehumidifiers in every single
one of them just small, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: little port One's it doesn't hold that
much liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be nice to have a huge one in
the main room But it's just nice to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool We're getting to this point put
a little little portable one inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's actually been keeping it in the
perfect range Seeing like 58 to like 66 if
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets crazy rainy and it's like really
really humid which again here I'm used to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing 80 could be you know 90 sometimes
so dehumidifier all the way The next big
[SPEAKER_00]: investment will be getting two of those
big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start with one let's see the
difference on the electricity bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm gonna get one of the big ones
because curing Has just and and drying has
[SPEAKER_00]: been probably the biggest challenge of
growing in a very humid spot Because even
[SPEAKER_00]: you keep it good in the room now curing it
It's just a whole different thing So if I
[SPEAKER_00]: can control the entire room where all the
grow tents are and keep that at a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: range That's kind of where I want to go
and just have that draining into a bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: much lower maintenance instead of going in
the tents every day taking out the Little
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier water and getting getting rid
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely Dehumidifiers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had the problem to have to use
humidifiers like you have right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you have and the complete
opposite of you I've never had to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier because my natural humidity
is like 30% now looking at right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's exactly at 30% right now I'm looking
at my monitor and wintertime it gets even
[SPEAKER_01]: crazier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 19% 18% So it's like super dry
here, which increases transpiration And
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth it could actually be a
negative thing in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have a humidifier So I add
in humidity now one thing I will say about
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidifiers is those will you know,
you can shove one of those in a small grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space either a small grow space or a
closet space LeVault is the brand that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using now and it's way better
than anything else I've ever used this one
[SPEAKER_01]: is top fill so you can actually just take
off the top Load up the water without
[SPEAKER_01]: having to like some of the other tanks you
have to like take off the whole thing flip
[SPEAKER_01]: it up Side down unscrew it then pour it in
it's like you don't have to do any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in one of your episodes that was
I mean that was really cool, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it easier I know it's like seems
like a small feature to some people but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like it's it's just the convenience
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great Also, it's connected to your
smartphone as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get notifications when it's out or
when it needs to be cleaned, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: really cool So I love that one and the
tank I think is like a gallon and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's larger than a lot of the other
tanks in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't recommend that brand enough I
do have a leaking issue with one of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think I just cleaned it and then now
it doesn't leak anymore So I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what happened there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah full disclosure Yeah,
no thing looks solid and that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the difference between the
dehumidifier In the small one the
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantage taking it out every day two
days if you forget about it Just gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: turn off stop taking out the the humidity
compared to if I had a bigger one I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running the hose it's going into the
bucket There's some things it really is
[SPEAKER_00]: making the work that it's worth making the
jump for and investing like we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs as being just The main thing or okay,
then we'll think about our tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But man, yeah, it's like it's not fun But
sometimes you're gonna have to drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it depending on where you live in
your situation on something like that It
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't the most exciting but man is it
gonna make it's gonna save so many
[SPEAKER_00]: headaches and just save you You know just
better butts Yeah, I completely agree and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why most of the episode so far just
what the entire episode has been on the
[SPEAKER_01]: space and the actual equipment that goes
in the space I do want to transition over
[SPEAKER_01]: now to actual growing the plants in that
small Space and I think I want to start
[SPEAKER_01]: with the container size, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a small space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do did you run and your small closet grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess what size would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I started and we I remember back
in Canada was cool I haven't seen these
[SPEAKER_00]: are usually since but this was like back
when it was like remember just the plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: bags They were disposable bags kind of
like the grow bags material We have now
[SPEAKER_00]: reusable these were like just plastic and
we're using one gallon sea of green but
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays especially having a plant limit
and that's Often the conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know depending on where you're
growing, you know Or what the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant limit is and where you are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 20, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never want to go above that I usually
want to say if you you know below just in
[SPEAKER_00]: case I want to cut a clone or just have
room to be able to play So the size I
[SPEAKER_00]: often do now, you know, and I always still
like to you know Know that big roots big
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as big as we can go In the smallest of
testing size three gallon just to see
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strains how they're gonna produce
in a 3-gallon and that's in a two by four
[SPEAKER_00]: small setup I'll put either two or three
in there and if I put three three gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: in then I'm gonna leave edge them out,
you know, not as long four weeks maybe and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kick them over whereas if I have just
two I could veg them out for Maybe eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know six if we wanted to just get into
it and then have more room and in there So
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done both and we have several
episodes on the channel showing both what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like to have three what it's like to
have two using three gallons but some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other favorite ones and a lot of
people actually make fun of me too Of this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but in a nice way I also kind of
laugh at it I use what's available and one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the first things available when I first
started growing again in Colombia was five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon paint buckets so like, you know,
but like not used with paint So there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: toxicities or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go buy a paint bucket It's like
three bucks or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, it's so much better than
going to the gardening store They're like
[SPEAKER_00]: ten bucks or something here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this luxurious one And so I just
got a bunch of these five gallons drilled
[SPEAKER_00]: holes in them and it was nice because they
were a little bit taller and if I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to do see a green I could fit a bit More,
you know into into that into that size And
[SPEAKER_00]: then the biggest is 11 gallons and that's
when like, you know in a five by five I
[SPEAKER_00]: can have five of these 11 gallons and veg
them out for eight weeks Make them big,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if we want to keep it to 20
plants can't do a sea green of 40 Let's do
[SPEAKER_00]: five big ones, you know in four separate
rooms, you know, so that's what I've also
[SPEAKER_00]: test That's on the biggest end is 12
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of it fabric yet But right now we're
testing two tens of two by four and a four
[SPEAKER_00]: by four with all four Fabric pots and
that's from basement auto flowers homie
[SPEAKER_00]: that has this fabric pots with the option
to train your plants Which you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll talk about talk a little later So
I'm again and there's the differences
[SPEAKER_00]: there I like the non fabric because I
started with that when I first got back
[SPEAKER_00]: into Columbia and I just found if it's not
the right quality You're gonna get leaking
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dries out quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to be ready for the
difference between growing in a fabric pot
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found sometimes if you're away from
the house an extra day or if you might
[SPEAKER_00]: miss a feed having the non fabric just
kept it kept the the moisture a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: longer and It was just something I just
got used to the timing of when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna water and everything So now we're
gonna be testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah fabrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got three gallons and five
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I got a double check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might just be five gallons,
but we're testing those right now as well
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are pros so many pros and cons
to running smaller containers versus
[SPEAKER_01]: larger containers I mean if you're running
one gallon containers and your your small
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent or grow space or closet Then you
have a whole bunch of plants to water if
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is big it might dry out the
medium faster So you have to water more
[SPEAKER_01]: often versus if you're running a larger
container say three gallons or five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons Maybe you have to water less
frequently You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just one of many pros and cons
to it We could sit here for the next 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and talk about container size,
but I don't really want to do that But you
[SPEAKER_01]: did mention training and I want to get
deeper into that Next plant training stand
[SPEAKER_01]: in a small pot Space staying in a closet
some people need to train their plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them small so they'll stay within
that space What do you typically do for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants training when you're in a small
space or closet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you nailed it totally
depends again on the space and talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about our small spaces first So two by
four to make the most out of our two by
[SPEAKER_00]: four There's so many the way I see it and
I've gone to the extreme of being the over
[SPEAKER_00]: trainer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've done it and I've over trained
the lady and it's like week 10 veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: she's like Just sure and there's like a
hundred things and I've gone the opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: end of like let's just don't touch
anything and let her go through and I
[SPEAKER_00]: found Now I find you're in a balance and
you understand the plants a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more, especially when you know the strain
I think it's always fun to the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out a strain if you can just let
it grow naturally to see That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have the time you want to get
right to training I think there's a few
[SPEAKER_00]: basic things talking about a small grow
that we should do The most basic and the
[SPEAKER_00]: first thing would definitely be topping,
you know just to not have one branch in If
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an extra two weeks that I want to
veg for I love to top and that way at
[SPEAKER_00]: least I'm dealing with four tops I've had
some episodes where it looks like we have
[SPEAKER_00]: just ten Amazing colas and that's from one
single topping that we did it depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the strain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I like to let's say You know if you
want to delay it a little bit and let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say it's all on timing I like to kick the
next garden over when that one's halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: done right to always kind of keep things
You always got a consistent harvest coming
[SPEAKER_00]: in at a certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, okay I want to keep vegging
these an extra two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's Train them a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a little bit of LST now,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We always pretty much do the topping but
right now I kind of living in that
[SPEAKER_00]: flexible area in my two by fours of just
How quick do I want to flip this over into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I have about four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's take our time Definitely
do one topping and then from there LST
[SPEAKER_00]: here to just make sure she's not gonna
stretch too close to the light You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's I don't know in a small space This
happens to a lot of us if it it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: happen at some point in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already happened or it's gonna happen
in the future Where you over veg a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: or a veg a plant's gonna overstretch and
in a small space You always have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind if you don't know that that
genetic or what she acts like You know
[SPEAKER_00]: treat her like she's probably gonna
stretch a lot play it on the safe end and
[SPEAKER_00]: don't veg her out too long Train her so
she's you know You got yourself some good
[SPEAKER_00]: playroom just in case she stretches a foot
and you're still you know a good at least
[SPEAKER_01]: six inches away from From the light if
someone does make that mistake of over
[SPEAKER_01]: vegging their plant So maybe they think
they veg a good amount of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then they flip Over to the flowering
like cycle and they get that two three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks of stretch and then they're really
outgrowing that space What are some things
[SPEAKER_01]: that they should do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just happened here recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the type of guy that always has his
His fan and carbon filter in the room up
[SPEAKER_00]: top and so the first time this happened I
was like, oh my god, like really soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are gonna get too close So first
step let's get the fan outside the room
[SPEAKER_00]: the carbon filter with the room get the
lights as high as you can so get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything Out of the room as far as
ventilation that you can on the outside
[SPEAKER_00]: your extractor that kind of stuff extract
from the outside Pull out, you know push
[SPEAKER_00]: it outside That's the first thing and
let's say you've done that or let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have the option to and now no
matter What you're gonna hit it depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on where you are You know, you can do a
really late topping, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of people who are very don't
stress You're going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already started flower Don't do
that if you have to you have to and if you
[SPEAKER_00]: like you've already weak one flower You're
seeing what's going on take her off
[SPEAKER_00]: because if not, you're gonna Run into her
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gonna be touching the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna be crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's she's stressing out So that's one
thing if you're early enough to to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to to clip her out I had another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to share there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to take plants out and fully She
was just gonna get too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was already too late in the flower to
start taking buds off So I really I had to
[SPEAKER_00]: start over again, you know on that strain
and that was really unfortunate So yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say take out your ventilation what
you can raise the heights as much as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can and then early Oh and that was the
last thing Sorry So again if you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: still a little bit early in that in that
flower and you're seeing a lot of stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: on the main stretchers If you need to do a
little bit LST just a little bit to slow
[SPEAKER_00]: her down, you know Like she's gonna you
see you're going right up and if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to take those two top four whatever
suckers just you know, slow them down just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit with a little bit of low
stress training and then that hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: should even out the rest of them will
start to come up and you'll have more of
[SPEAKER_01]: an even kind of canopy I go as far as even
super cropping, you know when I get those
[SPEAKER_01]: branches that just come up and just
actually It's a form of high stress
[SPEAKER_01]: training technically is have that thing
flop over and then the other branches will
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of catch up That's a good call out
but yeah I've had a handful of people over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years that have sent me pictures and
like I'm running out of space and they
[SPEAKER_01]: just have that one branch coming up and
it's like super close to the light and I
[SPEAKER_01]: tell him like you may want to sacrifice
that branch and they don't even think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, you know, you definitely can you
already mentioned this you definitely can
[SPEAKER_01]: top that remove that branch and that's
actually gonna help the other branches
[SPEAKER_01]: that are lower right because If you have
this one branch coming up and it's too
[SPEAKER_01]: close to the light You could stretch out
to the plant so much I've done this before
[SPEAKER_01]: to where it starts throwing out nanners
You know, it's just it's too much light
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts throwing out nanners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cutting that branch off Well,
then maybe the rest of the branches are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna now grow just fine because you've
sacrificed that one branch So a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't think of that you bring up a
great point Yeah, I just and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: photos we take on home grow TV or for our
Instagram Sometimes we take it at a point
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants life where she's not ready
for harvest, but she looks the best for
[SPEAKER_00]: photo so we'll cut her and then we'll take
the pictures and then we leave the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe to flower at max on one shall we
push her another two weeks and Interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: enough now that you say that now I
remember going back and we looked at it
[SPEAKER_00]: after and it's like we never took anything
off We're like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, everything is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though two weeks ago a week ago We
took off, you know our beautiful our
[SPEAKER_00]: catalog one the rest now are like have Wow
have all matured So yeah, I think yeah You
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to be worried if you got to
take off a big one now you bring that up
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it for photography and yeah,
she she will still mature Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you do in
particular when you're watering your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you know specific to closet
growing specific to closet growing not so
[SPEAKER_00]: much If I had to relate it to I do keep my
reservoirs obviously a little bit smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: and let's talk reservoirs I think you know
for per tent because As a home grower
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you have a small closet grow
whether you have a four by four five by
[SPEAKER_00]: five You know a ten by five, whatever it
is Everyone's gonna have a different way
[SPEAKER_00]: of feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we do at home grow TV with our
water at least is we do a reservoir we
[SPEAKER_00]: dechlorinate 24 hours before at least and
a small closet grow depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I don't want to leave my water out
in the reservoir for you know for too long
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to just monitor it and I use
those same five gallon buckets leave it
[SPEAKER_00]: out for 24 hours before Usually 10% of
what the the pot is is is what I'm giving
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know for water and I'm moving now
almost like almost a daily where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: almost testing those are the few small
gardens and just watering them kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: daily small smaller amounts So no big
difference, but what I will say and
[SPEAKER_00]: something exciting coming up I don't know
if it's gonna be great or if it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: just totally not relevant to plants But
there's an alkaline or it's just it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have to be alkaline, but there's a
water filter that I used to use Just as a
[SPEAKER_00]: person not for growing and this is
basically allows me to control the pH that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of the machine All the way from
you know, I can choose 11 to pH 2.5 So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think there's gonna be some exciting stuff
in the future for home grow TV and
[SPEAKER_00]: experience experimenting stuff with water
Everything from extracts to you know to
[SPEAKER_00]: watering our plants and seeing the
difference is really something going on
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning stuff like that But no as of right
now, I'm a very typical take out your
[SPEAKER_00]: water 24 hours dechlorinate small little
reservoir And yeah do that probably about
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, pretty straightforward stuff
there So we are coming up towards the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the episode and one of the questions I
like to ask on most episodes is getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: device for beginners So what advice do you
have for those that are new to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: To closet growing so yeah, I know great
question I think advice for new growers
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into small closet grows Maybe just
small tent grows two by four two by two,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that may be I would say
definitely keep it simple Don't over
[SPEAKER_00]: complicate it and get started taking it
one step at a time meaning if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have Everything in your budget right now
to get the dehumidifier We may have talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about today to get the humidifier that you
may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you need to start off with You know
not your most ideal light that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: choose get your kit get going Don't over
complicate it and I would also say as a
[SPEAKER_00]: side piece to that is Follow if there if
you don't have a grow bro, that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: take you through this step-by-step I would
follow someone who has the results that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking to achieve whether that's
someone who has a grow journal seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest online Whether that's watching mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go it's content someone who's done it
proven the concept and follow that
[SPEAKER_00]: step-by-step Don't lose yourself in the
information of what nutrients what
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics what light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get going have fun with it and then
because after your first two grows Every
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then you can start making
decisions your own choices and and and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of play it from there But yeah,
I would just say keep it simple and start
[SPEAKER_00]: having fun growing in the small nice nice
little closet grow Definitely keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know people who grow in a
closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just have a light in there and that's
it They don't even have any ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even have air circulation They
just keep the closet door open and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a fan blowing towards the closet door
and the plants still grow Exactly can
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly get away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just might Not get the most optimal
dense buds, you know that you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for but you'll still get a harvest off of
it So I like your advice there when you
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about keeping it simple because we
did spend a lot of time here talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Environment and the equipment in order to
automate the environment because it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: important But you can certainly get away
with not having a lot of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up How can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can find us on home grow TV on
YouTube Just home grow TV also on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram same thing home grow TV And I
think the future is where it gets really
[SPEAKER_00]: exciting because yeah right now we're
known for a lot of seed to harvest videos
[SPEAKER_00]: We do do lives me and you are going live
right after this here on home grow TVs
[SPEAKER_00]: channel We do interviews not nearly as
much as you brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a master at that and we learn so
much from watching your stuff It's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, we've done a few breeders here and
there but where is home grow TV going is I
[SPEAKER_00]: think to that documentary shorts film
showing Columbia Showing the breeders kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like that strain hunters what we got to
see back in 2013 I think is when that that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of came out that strain hunters area
that documentary style of the story the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers the people Where did our land
races really come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting to meet these these kind of
families who have been doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know from generations to generations
here And that's all they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gets me really fired up and
also those tours so getting to see being
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Columbia I really feel like in
five years, you know what Columbia will be
[SPEAKER_00]: known for will be Totally different than
what they have been known for over the
[SPEAKER_00]: last 20 years Because of the movement of
what's happening here with this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's unbelievable the attention It's
getting so to be here and to not be
[SPEAKER_00]: telling that story of some major,
you know players down here I think it
[SPEAKER_00]: would just be would just be silly So
that's what you can look forward to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future with home grow TV some beautiful
short stories some amazing tours of some
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful facilities and Some families
that have been living it for generation to
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely looking forward to seeing
What you put out on your channel in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future and I'll definitely have a link to
