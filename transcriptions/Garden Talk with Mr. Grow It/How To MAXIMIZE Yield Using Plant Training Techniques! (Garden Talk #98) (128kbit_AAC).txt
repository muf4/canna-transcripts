[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you end up with branches that are too
skinny, that are in the middle still,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some genetics like to do that,
you want to lollipop those as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get more production
vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't find it to be a pretty
looking site, but if you do it just right,
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipop and maintenance your plants,
you'll get more production that way
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about a leveled canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where topping will help you
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just making sure you're not letting
anything get like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want something low and something
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first trellis is simply to train the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second trellis is to support the
middle branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third trellis is to support the
upper part of the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to be able to create that
beautiful art and train a plant the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you see them being trained, but not put
that much physical labor into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 98.

[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for nine years and
is the creator of the Web Trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks all about different plant
training techniques and how to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: yield using them.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I'm joined with Josh, but some of
you know him as BabyGrowilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, Mr. Growit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to say hi to you and appreciate
you for letting me on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say what's up to the whole
Mr. Growit fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk about
maximizing yield with plant training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many different ways to
train plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do things right, you can
absolutely increase the overall yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get deep into that,
let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really active as a kid and I used
to really be into sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that took its toll on me the
most was basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a few wear and tear on my ankles,
I found that this medicine helped me deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pain a lot better than other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a while, I started to take
advantage of the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2010, that's when I heard about it,
the program, the medical plant program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when I started getting my hands
dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we get deep into training
plants, one of the things you had
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned when I sent you over the initial
list of questions is you had mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plant needs to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you wanted to talk about plant health
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that so important before you start
training plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we talk about plant training,
I'd like to obviously talk about plant
[SPEAKER_00]: health because without a healthy plant,
you really can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although a lot of people that are starting
off, I realize people pop seeds and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have really healthy plants because they
haven't gotten any viruses or any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to people that probably for the most
part have a clone where maybe there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: virus in there or some kind of pathogens
or even like it's good to start off with
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs and make sure you don't have bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why are your plants sick?
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, the worst one is
when your stems get purple, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to train your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you have purple stems in
vegetation, not in flower, because those
[SPEAKER_00]: are two different things, usually if you
put the light too close on flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get like the plant itself will try
to what they call like shade itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it turns purple and that's fine in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in vegetation, if that happens,
and it's coming from a deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you have to try to correct it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where you start digging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start off, make sure I don't
have bugs that I can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually I'm really, you know,
like very vigilant in my garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I find out, if I find out I have
like something in my roots or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, I usually start off with like
I'll start off with three grams per gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: of peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use cyanidate, which is more
concentrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably a more concentrated
dosage than you would get out of peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said though, I'll also use a
little bit of dish soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to like really help me out
like in the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is I wipe out a lot of my
my built up colonies of like microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: micro fungi, whatever is in there that
took me so long to build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have to kind of like re-inoculate
and get everything back in the output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like usually I like to use amino acids,
fauvic acid and humic acid all at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time, which is, you know, it's in the
recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like a little bit of a
cheat code.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I want to get more of it,
I'll just get it separately and I'll add
[SPEAKER_00]: it in there all in the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put microbes, everything right back
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I see that I don't have any bugs
or anything, what I'll do is the next step
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take is I'll actually add magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're if you're already using
epsom salt and you're already using the
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, I recommend to use a little
more magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also recommend to use phosphorus
separately in raw form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually like if you if you buy like a
product like raw, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: raw MPK, they'll already have it in the,
you know, they have it in raw form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just go buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just real easy to have it in raw
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add a little more of those two things,
which is the magnesium I mentioned and the
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of covers you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, for the sake of having
purple stems, along with the fact that you
[SPEAKER_00]: do have to make sure that your environment
is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get your environment correct and
go over those two, three things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: just mentioned, that's like my process of
elimination when it comes to purple stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is the issue with purple
stems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you hear people say that zinc,
you hear some people say it's phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you hear some people say it's magnesium,
you hear people say that it's for cold
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it one of the things and not the other
or is it a combination of things or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My answer to that is usually when I start
to spot purple stems, it'll be like after
[SPEAKER_00]: I transplant it and maybe like left the
lights at and all the way 100% intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll notice the purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's almost me creating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I could be on top of it and I could
like lower my percentage to around 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% for the first five days, it kind of
helps me ease my way into the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I noticed more purple stems with
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it has a lot to do with the
fact that the lights are flickering at a
[SPEAKER_00]: faster rate than your traditional HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with all that said, there's other ways
to create purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if it gets too cold, obviously you're
going to get purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really talk about it a lot when I'm
around other growers and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, what's your problem with purple
stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have purple stems, you just
can't train your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're trying to do is
train your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the stems become more harder and
less malleable and you can't really bend
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I totally agree with you on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like it doesn't girth up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like your branches don't thicken up after
they, if you can correct the problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll start to see these green lines
coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the green lines almost like come
out and then push out the purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually you'll see purple lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you corrected the problem, you know,
like if you did a good job at correcting
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you got it on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been times where I've gotten
purple stems in, like the plants almost
[SPEAKER_00]: never recovered from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's been times where you just go
into flower and they almost like fix
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves right away because sometimes
they say, don't put a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a sick plant in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which I don't, I don't recommend to do
it, but there's been times where my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: been sick and just the 12 hours of resting
and maybe something in the formula because
[SPEAKER_00]: they get more phosphorus right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just corrects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't recommend it,
but I actually recommend to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get, you go through them three things
that I brought up and that's a good way to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go about correcting the purple
stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say the plant is healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone is ready for training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with one of the most common
methods of training, which is low stress
[SPEAKER_01]: training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us, what is low stress training?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you do low stress training and how
do you do low stress training in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I do want to be clear on is
that you don't need to necessarily do
[SPEAKER_00]: these practices that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, it's not the only way to get
maximum production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have like a tent and the law says
you can grow 12 plants, then you could
[SPEAKER_00]: just, basically what we're trying to do is
create a sea of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't matter how you do it or how
I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just matters that I fill it and I make
it look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically this strategy that I'm
practicing is for like micro growers where
[SPEAKER_00]: they've kind of set certain laws and in
that they kind of, they made it to where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really mass produce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like some people, micro growers will
make the best out of the 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, even the 12 plants they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why people do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that said, so what happens is
when you only have so many plants to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with, you got a four by four, you got a
six by six and you're trying to train
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and you only have four because
that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is when you, all the oxens
which are the hormones of that plant are
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you pull these plants out and if
you do it properly with the right pruning,
[SPEAKER_00]: the middle branches are going to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people are scragging,
which is the difference is that that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking to kind of do more
branches to where you're kind of focusing
[SPEAKER_00]: a little different when you're doing the
LST grow and you're trying to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect bush of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to kind of shed a little more light on
that, LST is when you pull the main branch
[SPEAKER_00]: down or a couple main branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You distribute the plant energy towards
the middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, with the right
lollipopping and the foliation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get colas in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's basically what a lot of
people want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to end up with the smaller
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But very important, another thing I like
to mention is it's important to not train
[SPEAKER_00]: the skinnier, not so thick branches that
are in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to train only the big thick branches
that were kind of like the ones that were
[SPEAKER_00]: too tall, you move those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you end up with branches that are
too skinny, that are in the middle still,
[SPEAKER_00]: because some genetics like to do that,
you want to lollipop those as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, if it shows you it has enough
potential to do something, then maybe top
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really lollipopping is like one of the
things that is more important than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything when it comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you gave me one style to grow
right now and I only had one way to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd just be a bunch of plants and I
lollipop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really comes down to plant
maintenance and plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into lollipopping in a little
bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is one of the questions on the list
here a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the biggest mistakes that
new growers make that are just starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: train is pulling that initial branch down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned you talked about the
hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't actually pull that branch
down so it's lower than the other
[SPEAKER_01]: branches, then that main branch that you
just pulled down is going to still
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to dominate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes when the plant is young,
you can't actually pull that branch all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way down to be lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just need to do a slight
bend to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually you want to get that main
top down lower than some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant will then focus its growth on
those other branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens time and time again with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured I'd mention that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'd like to also add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I would want to add is on top of
what you said, sometimes you'll tie a
[SPEAKER_00]: branch down and it's not tied good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this branch is coming up and now
it almost doesn't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could really hold that branch
there, that's very important to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: really firmly, whatever trellis unit you
have, if you could just firmly hold it
[SPEAKER_00]: there and not allow it to come back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not what you were aiming for
when you started everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of, I started using the
training clips in order to then train them
[SPEAKER_00]: later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed that a good friend of mine,
he basically told me this would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago and I never tried it,
but I wanted to do it for RMD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I put the clips on it,
took them off, did everything right,
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to open them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I went to basically train the plant
again and it snapped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed that when you do that,
you're creating that barky area where it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets like a knuckle sometimes and even
almost like a super crop style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you go to train it again,
it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of talking from my experience
and basically how far I've gotten so far,
[SPEAKER_00]: I realized that it's not a good idea to
get that bark on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that shorter area, if you're not aiming
for a small little plant, if you're aiming
[SPEAKER_00]: to get like a bigger plant and you want to
be able to train it or manipulate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could never retrain it after you
already got that knuckle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just makes it that much harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to the LST, it's all right
to low stress train and kind of pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant around and do what you want to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're committed once you put the
training clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do any kind of tying down and
creating that little knuckle at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Training clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some people who probably don't
know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just clarify what exactly you mean
by the training clips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they just the standard garden clips?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about the ones that
actually attach to the actual stem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just started like kind of like
doing research with them because I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to implement it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know the exact name of them,
but they're the ones that everybody's 3D
[SPEAKER_00]: printing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you put it in there and it just kind
of is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different strokes with different
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends who you are and what you're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect strategy for somebody
that's not going to train the plant again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as far as my product testing went,
that's what I tried to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just didn't work the way I wanted
it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used those training clips that
you mentioned, whether it goes directly
[SPEAKER_01]: into the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'm actually clipping it onto the
side of the grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a regular garden clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using just regular garden ties,
like two bucks at your local gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using those to tie down the branches
to the side of the grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a different technique there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you tying the branches down to the
side of the grow pot at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just using the training clips?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, like I said, that was just
kind of like a trial that I did just to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how everything would work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you know I use these the
umbrellas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do, it's a custom trellis that
I design that it's not very given.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't give back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you open it, it's firm,
it holds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whatever I'm trying to train stays the
way I want it to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I was just trying to see if
I could train my plants a little lower,
[SPEAKER_00]: at a lower point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you could get away with using
the way I thought of it, if I could tie
[SPEAKER_00]: two or three branches down and make a
difference a little shorter, I just wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what that would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just didn't like the way it worked out
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that said, when it comes to
training a plant, tying a plant down,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you just said, a couple of my friends
found that they like using a more firm
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis because of the fact that sometimes
when you pull a branch down, you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: it down and it'll recalibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what I like to call it,
when it recalibrates, comes back up
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes these taller plants,
the branches just go this way on you for
[SPEAKER_00]: no reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just not as organized.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I still got to try one of my
trellis units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you mentioned umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that sparked a lot of
people's interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a lot of people that
haven't even heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about, it's actually
your product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You created this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I got five years ago,
I kept basically kind of like lollipop in
[SPEAKER_00]: my plant speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we're gonna get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I was training this plant called
Gorilla Glue that everybody had in like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015, that's when I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like been growing it ever
since.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was happening is this plant grew
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I would lollipop it, it looked
like the reflection of an umbrella.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I just didn't wanna do your
traditional PVC when you're not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you can't really detach or retract
it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't easy to store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it a couple of times and I didn't
like how it would just be not easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: store basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen this umbrella reflection
coming out of what I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I decided to pull the
trigger on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five years later now, I've really,
really, I really got it to the point where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really good formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wait till my plants are about 10 inches
tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is I'll top it right
around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches will come out and I'll have
two perfect branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because this genetic called Wookie
Pebbles that Capuleta, the breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: actually made, it's an exclusive genetic
nobody really has access to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got it, that's a whole nother story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant grows very, very vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just grows very stretchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows like a solid diesel that I grew
in the past, like really tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would hand it out to people and
they'd be like, I give up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want this plant anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I can't get it to produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you top this plant and it just,
instead of like the gorilla glue,
[SPEAKER_00]: we would top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the branches would just kind of like
grow like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'd just be like this perfect bush
after you top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant you would top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just have another branch
right on the side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't even, and then it'd just be
the same amount of branches it had just
[SPEAKER_00]: all going up and it wouldn't really fill
anything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't understand what anybody was
talking about because I was working on
[SPEAKER_00]: this product when I got this genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I hand out my product to people
and they're like, oh, this produced me so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower and this, that, and the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I would have got it earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wish I would have just listened to
you two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, relax, you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Point is they're like, this actually makes
more production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really get more production out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I've been using it so
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't realize anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep using my formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after 10 inches, once the plant gets
really stretchy, because it's a stretchy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and I'm actually forcing this plant
to look bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is you get those two
branches, then the other two are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even in some cases, if you don't get
the trellis on it early enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very forgiving because what will
happen is first off, it's a portable
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's basically designed just
for the single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is if you don't get the
trellis on it early enough and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: start training it early enough,
you can go ahead and let it just get tall
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of out of control on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you get this trellis on it,
if you train the branches outward and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still like a foot or two of like
this plant just going up again,
[SPEAKER_00]: now I decided where if the plant is
healthy, again, back to the healthy part,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if it's not healthy, there's no
way you're going to pull this off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once this branch goes back up,
I then pull it back down and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: satellites that were going off of it,
now all like just kind of like get
[SPEAKER_00]: recalibrated and literally the energy
leaves that, the upper part of this branch
[SPEAKER_00]: that I pull over, the energy like you go
back like a week or two later and that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of goes up like six or seven
inches and that's all you're getting out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you could get nine, eight to even
10 branches just going off of that one
[SPEAKER_00]: that are like, it just, it puts that main
branch to shame.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the oxens get distributed to the,
all the way, the branches furthest away
[SPEAKER_00]: from the one you just pulled is going to
be the thickest brollicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're all going to be just
gorgeous branches going up and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just create your own canopy when you're in
control of your garden like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when it's an art and you're
trying to grow a craft flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's just, it's a beautiful
thing to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like an art and it gives you more
time to, you know, clean broom,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, mop your garden, make sure it's
clean because you're more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not spending time grabbing a piece
of rope, tying it down, grabbing a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of rope, tying it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's okay for the guy with four plants
in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're a micro-grower and you're
like basically a caregiver for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people and you're growing on a larger
scale, then even if it's a basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's nice to be able to create that
beautiful art and train a plant the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you see them being trained, but not put
that much physical labor into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what, that's where basically why I
did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like an interesting concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely something I want to try
out in the future because I do find myself
[SPEAKER_01]: growing those tall plants and not wanting
to tie down as much these days as I used
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think just putting that umbrella
trellis in and being able to spread it
[SPEAKER_01]: out, it seems like it would be a little
bit easier than doing all those ties like
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my question is- I do want to butt in
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could hold your thought on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that you don't like
training your plants and basically what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is they go vertical and I love
vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's actually where I get my
production from is once I train the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow horizontal, I then pretty much
just leave them alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, it just looks like a bunch of
small plants on the side of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing wrong with growing
plants that just go straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're happy with and you
know how to, you have the right light that
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates down to that lower canopy,
you're going to get more production
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people don't find it to be a
pretty looking site, but if you do it just
[SPEAKER_00]: right, lollipop and prune your
maintenance, your plants, you'll get more
[SPEAKER_00]: production that way vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't bashing it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just people get really, you know,
when it comes to growing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: people want to fight with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I like platforms like yours
and it'd be awesome if I can come on other
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms and just have a nice civil
debate with people on these conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody has to punch nobody in the
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I was saying is basically just
the time consuming that it takes to tie
[SPEAKER_01]: down plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not so much disliking the shape,
but more so the time spent to tie things
[SPEAKER_01]: down, but I still do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, back to my question was about the
umbrella's trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to know like, what are the
dimensions of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are you, like when you put the
trellis in, are you just shoving it down
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil, like a stake like you
typically do with a stake?
[SPEAKER_01]: How far down does it go into the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I basically been working on
two different bases or stands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it is is one is I kind of make
them custom to whoever like say like you
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out to me, you're like, look,
I got this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times I will consult with
people and try to tell them, what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants are you trying to have?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do want to commit to the style
because you know, once you buy these,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're kind of committed to that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I have umbrellas all the
way from two feet all the way to like four
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recently started making them square.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stands go in the soil and they're made
about 13 inches out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really made to go into like 20
gallon pots, the ones I make for myself
[SPEAKER_00]: and local growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I make them smaller for anybody for
whatever they're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make them like a little shorter than
the pot so that like there's like four
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of give so that because I realized
to put it actually in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got more results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to go back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of like putting it out and over
and I was like, you know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just make sure that there's
an inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could just get an inch,
of soil over that thing, I mean those
[SPEAKER_00]: roots anchor it in and then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually the best time to use it is on
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, you're going to transplant
your plants then that's a good opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to put the stand in because it's just a
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is you don't have to use
the umbrellas right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of just get that stand in
there and then worry about that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another reason why there are different
tiers to it is so that if you want to put
[SPEAKER_00]: a two footer and still make it through the
door, you can and you know, go to your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room with it and not have any,
you know, like a plant that can't make it
[SPEAKER_00]: through a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had a brain fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't want to run into like having
a not be able to grab my plant from here
[SPEAKER_00]: and move it over there basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that there was, you know, that's why I
came up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get into flower room,
if you want to put a bigger umbrella on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you don't have to worry about you
know, space restrictions through a door or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could pull this other umbrella out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually way bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it on or if it's even if it's not,
it's just I made it that way for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: have more options and be able to be more
mobile, more access to every side of their
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say your electrician needs to get in your
electrical panels on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just pop the season like two
minutes, you know, and you throw the
[SPEAKER_00]: second tier on whenever you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You throw a third tier, fourth tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just keep going with tiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, that's where vertical
production comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to give a shout out to Cron,
Don Gross, Cron, C-H-R-O-N-E underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Gross, because he inspired me between
him and the Northern Scragger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern Scragger taught me some
techniques on how to kind of like make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you don't tangle the wrong branches
when you're opening it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one thing to focus on that,
but don't let the branch get like tangled
[SPEAKER_00]: under the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the right branches to go up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would have conversations all the time
and he would tell me how ugly the big
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't like them at all, but it's all
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it sounds awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely going to check out your
channel again, or your Instagram page,
[SPEAKER_01]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you have a website and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely link your Instagram down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those folks that are tuning in on this,
could click on your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can see the umbrella trellis in
action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, let's move on to lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that a couple different
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people consider this a form of
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people consider it a form of
pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever way you think of it, we'll still
cover it here today because it can
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely be very beneficial when it
comes to helping to maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it and how do you go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So lollipopping is pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the word that I think,
if you ask me on my outlook on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's just a word that we used to
describe pruning because that's basically
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pruning the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, pruning is very important
because you just don't want to be sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there trimming little flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like cry now, laugh later
because you're not going to be sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there killing yourself later on when it's
time to trim if you lollipop just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it frees up microclimates from
happening where bugs can hide and mold can
[SPEAKER_00]: be created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these issues can happen inside
there because you're looking at your
[SPEAKER_00]: thermostat in the room and it says 60,
but is it really 60?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to help you stay away from
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help air flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help, in my opinion,
the quality of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't run into quality problems and I
think that has a little bit to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a part in the fact that I grow
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I do lollipopping, I usually do the
lower third, sometimes the lower fourth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people make the mistake
of going too high up when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipopping and ends up stunting the
growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it right before stretch and they
don't get the stretch that they think
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of a sudden, they have poor
production straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to talk about with
the lollipopping is, sorry to cut you off,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do it four times a veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say a plant gets about four
defoliations of vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets about three to four in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of shocking the plant,
we never do too much at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to do so much at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I do more late in flower
too, about 21 days to that 20 to 30 day
[SPEAKER_00]: period, I still get in there because then
you really start seeing these little
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers that just aren't going to make the
cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important for me to have
quality flowers, so I just take off the
[SPEAKER_00]: little tiny flowers that just aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to turn into anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go all the way until day 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time I will actually do the
lollipopping is typically it's around day
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even during flower, you can get some stuff
growing down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually maintain that, continue to pluck
off those little buds that are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: down on the lowers even into flowering
just to make sure that I don't end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: that popcorn larvae stuff at the end of
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping, let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's quite a few people who do
topping and there are so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started out, I was letting
the plant grow to the fifth node and then
[SPEAKER_01]: topping down to the third.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I was, next time around, let the
plant grow up to the fifth node,
[SPEAKER_01]: top at that fifth node and let those lower
branches grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do for topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend who would always just top,
top, top, top, top and not do plant
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, dude, take care of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got really just gung-ho with the whole
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as topping goes with me,
I wait 10 inches, let the plant create the
[SPEAKER_00]: Y structure that I like to, you know,
my terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates that Y, let it open it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that happens, sometimes the plant
don't grow perfect and even, so there'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be one branch that just outgrows the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, early, veg, late flower,
I'll come in, I'll top that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when it's late and veg,
I'll start to try to flatten my canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just come in and find the tallest
branch, top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll wait until another branch passes
the canopy and then come and top it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's more of a place and time for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually grow a variety of different
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, I'll get that one cultivar,
that just grows slower, stays squattier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this other one just happens to just
have longer internodes, grow faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones, I'll top more often and allow
my other plants that are growing slower or
[SPEAKER_01]: staying squattier to kind of catch up a
little bit because oftentimes they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in one grow tent and I have to
flip that whole tent to flower at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of utilizing training on some
plants to control the height while the
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants catch up is certainly
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping does, it can certainly,
if you're doing topping and low stress
[SPEAKER_01]: training, you can certainly manipulate the
plant and train the plant to be more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: wider structure, have more main colas
coming up, and can certainly increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: overall yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely glad we covered topping
because that is one of the main high
[SPEAKER_01]: stress training techniques that a lot of
people use in order to try to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about a leveled canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where topping will help you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just making sure you're not letting
anything get like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want something low and something
high.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do get branches, one get low,
one get high, one thing I usually do is,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in flower when I can't do any
other type of training, is supercropping
[SPEAKER_01]: to bend that branch down and allow the
other ones to catch up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any supercropping at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about what that is and when
you usually do it, if you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm happy you brought that up
because I don't really use it because like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said earlier, once you get that knuckle
and flower, it's okay to get it because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not really trying to train it after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do supercropping because I'm not
in a low ceiling situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that after I supercropped it,
the branch no longer wants to stretch and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I get my production from,
where these new genetics, they kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just grow stretchy and they stack up far
apart from each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the genetics I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't like my plants to do that
so I don't do supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the experience I have with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pigeon's420, I don't know if you know who
he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a podcast with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He supercrops every single branch which I
thought was just super interesting when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's young as well because he wants to
build up that strength in the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally only supercrop in flowering
the first three weeks when I have that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch period and one of the branches or
some of the branches get up and grow over
[SPEAKER_01]: the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll super crop those ones only in order
to try to maintain that even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works perfect in that situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a master at it but I've done it
and a friend of mine does it as well and I
[SPEAKER_00]: go by and look at his grow and I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works great for the application he's
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's in a tent so I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, there's certain branches
that you kind of want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get it to all, just be that level
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it can make sense for many different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another thing where some people
consider it training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people consider it a form of
pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, a lot of people claim that it
does increase yield so I figured we'd get
[SPEAKER_01]: into that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any type of defoliation at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, when do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say I'm doing a lot of lollipop and
I'm pretty much defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're both different because
sometimes you go with a focus that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to lollipop and prune and
defoliation sometimes could just be you
[SPEAKER_00]: going into your flower room usually is
where I would defoliate and just take
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was taught a long time ago and this
is kind of a technique I still use,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow these kind of big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to create a circle of light
penetration and I'll pick off a leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: that's on this side, a leaf that's on this
side, another one this way and this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go in a circle, defoliating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll focus on that one little area and
once it looks like there's light
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrating to the bottom, I'll move on to
another circle per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just start doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go in a circle with taking leaves off
and that allows that penetration all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you only doing that in veg or are you
doing that in flower as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do it in late flower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do that mainly in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: To allow the light to get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of a time that I'm
defoliating and not lollipopping when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it any other time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in veg, when I'm lollipopping,
I am defoliating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things can definitely go hand in
hand, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of people, you said people use it
as a training technique and I've noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think Beast Coast does it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned it from the Grandmaster level.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learned that if you take these leaves
off at the top, these big leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually trains the plant too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pretty cool little technique that
I just learned just watching people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a cool little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I like to do is really
focus on defoliating the center,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the middle of the canopy, going down in
and leaving those outer ones mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly towards the bottom of the plant,
the outer around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to leave those big bottom leaves
there often times because that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I call it the skirt method actually
because it kind of looks like a skirt in a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is because if you're coming
across a deficiency, things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrition, things can get out of
balance in the medium and you can start
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing signs of deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps to be able to see that
happening because if you take off the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves, well then you kind of screwed in
that sense because then you don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: see the deficiency as well as if you had
those lowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure I'd mention the skirt technique
is kind of leaving those lowers as an
[SPEAKER_01]: indicator so you could see if you're
seeing a deficiency or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a friend of mine that just told me
not to leave the skirt there because I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since then, I just stopped doing it
so there's no rhyme or reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't leave the skirt there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about, vegetation or
flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do the defoliation in like veg
before flipping the flower and then I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first three weeks I usually defoliate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll look to defoliate on day seven,
day 14 and day 21, but oftentimes it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't need to be defoliated that often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics is going to depend on it of
course, but yeah I'll leave that skirt all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way through there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really saw harm in leaving that
skirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing if there's a lack of
airflow then yeah you're going to pull off
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves there, but other than that I'll
just leave those bottom leaves there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You leave them all the way through too
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, so different strokes for different
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean like I said I don't do it but
there's not a rhyme or reason why I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, well we covered quite a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only thing we didn't really
cover was fimming and I think you remember
[SPEAKER_01]: correctly last time we spoke you don't do
any type of fimming right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't do fimming because I'm just
not something I ever got into plus it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of creates more branches and I'm not too
crazy about more branches and that in
[SPEAKER_00]: certain scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, are there any other plant training
techniques that we didn't cover that you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: like to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think we pretty much covered
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said I just usually pull my plants
out but if I'm slacking and my plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: too tall I usually come back and wrap it
around the outside which is you know
[SPEAKER_00]: basically covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're pretty good as far as
plant training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, I appreciate you coming out of the
podcast and revealing your training
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to I think if I could shed light
on anything it would be that my first
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis is simply to train the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second trellis is to support the
middle branches and the third plant I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis is to support the upper part of
the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know to anybody out there that can
like you know I encourage you to try it
[SPEAKER_00]: both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really I encourage you to not train them
after you train them the first time but if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to do an experiment go ahead and
you'll see that it just works a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: when you just let the plant just go up
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you get the colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep just training and training
branches you end up with skinnier branches
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you end up with skinnier flower
or smaller smaller flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made that mistake before you know
continuing to train all the way till
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch was done and all of a sudden I
have these this real small flat plant
[SPEAKER_01]: which doesn't really grow up much and the
buds are just kind of all consolidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes you got a branch in and
you got this one here and then it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: you train this one again and now you're
just shading another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you got to kind of like pick
when when's enough is enough on the
[SPEAKER_00]: training the topping with all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other advice for maybe beginners who
are just training for the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to find a good seed bank or genetic
bank you know somewhere you could get some
[SPEAKER_00]: good reliable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much start off there get your
environment under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tent is the best way to go about that
because it retains everything a lot better
[SPEAKER_00]: than just trying to start off in a room
that's going to not have any it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be able to retain as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know a tent's very efficient make
sure not to water too much because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody makes that mistake when it comes
to cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fill the thing up with water
actually just leave a little bit at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom to where the roots actually have to
go searching for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just if you're using LEDs make sure to
keep your you can go as high as like 87
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep your humidity as high as up to 65
and you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could stay under that VPD for those
LEDs you do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS wasn't it does it's not as it's a
little more forgiving because of I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: they say that the the HPS actually create
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you to for you to use an LED you
have to kind of like run your room a
[SPEAKER_00]: little harder to kind of buffer that whole
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those few things I think are very
important make sure you because the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course the your environment for your
plants is very important humidity is very
[SPEAKER_00]: important when they're small.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do them things and you get off
to a good start.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up how can the
listeners find you and do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: anything upcoming in the future that you
want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much nothing coming up in the
future I just been just working on this
[SPEAKER_00]: project that I've been working on since
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the web trellis which is an idea that
I patented and trying to get it out there
[SPEAKER_00]: just so people could see it use it kind of
like grow with you know use use the web
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis style in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always just you know it's an option
and I'm on Instagram as Umbrella
[SPEAKER_00]: underscore trellis and my backup is the
web trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to actually that's pretty much
it just going to be on there and I am
[SPEAKER_00]: going to build my different different
social platforms up because right now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically only Facebook and IG but moving
forward maybe even get my YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start growing some tomato plants or
something and really start like crushing
[SPEAKER_00]: it and showing people how you get some
really good production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Horizontal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well like I mentioned earlier in the
episode I definitely have a link to Josh's
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram down in the YouTube description
section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on one of the podcast platforms
just search for them you'll find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this episode click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
garden talk podcast and I would love for
[SPEAKER_01]: you to tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh once again thanks for coming on this
has been it's been pretty insightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like talking about plant training
because there are just so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to do it to go about it and hearing
your way to go about it which is different
[SPEAKER_01]: from my way which is different than a lot
of other people's ways is interesting and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's definitely some takeaways here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for coming on to the podcast
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
