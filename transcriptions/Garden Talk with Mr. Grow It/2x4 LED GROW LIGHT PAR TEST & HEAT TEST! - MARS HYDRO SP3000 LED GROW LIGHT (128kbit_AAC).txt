[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro sent me over their SP3000 LED
grow light and in this video I am going to
[SPEAKER_00]: test the PAR output and I'm also going to
do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually already did another video where
I unboxed the unit and I tested two of
[SPEAKER_00]: them in a 4x4 grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to test one in a
2x4 grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the grow
light specs but I will leave a link down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can click on that if you want to
learn more about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Range PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these PAR test videos just to give
you a general idea of what the PAR output
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents that
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances 18 inches 24 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: and 30 inches and this light does have a
dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll set it to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 2.44 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 290 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Bye.
you
