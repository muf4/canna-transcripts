[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've never heard the name before and
it's got a lot of syllables and the price
[SPEAKER_00]: is incredibly cheap, avoid that
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, there are some pretty crappy
lights that still get surprisingly good
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they manage to get the
spectrum and the diodes right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you cannot simply get your light intensity
up to 50,000 lux or whatever with the
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong spectrum and expect to get great
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one problem with lighting is
often that the first time you set it up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you allow a light leak to happen during
the dark hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: More often than not, it's not that a
person gets a bad light, it's that they
[SPEAKER_00]: get a good light and they hang it
incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 66.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Lex Blazer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk all about
lighting for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get deep into LED grow
lights, but we're also going to touch upon
[SPEAKER_01]: your traditional HID lighting such as HPS,
MH, and CMH grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you do a little
introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Lex Blazer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a how-to YouTuber and I've been
gardening the herbs for about 15 years or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been like a huge commercial or
underground grower, you know, contrary to
[SPEAKER_00]: popular opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most I can say is I've been a very
stable and steady grower for about 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also one of the older medical
plant YouTubers in this niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I originally kind of became known for
throwing together these very quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient how-to's for beginner growers,
covering all their questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did that for a bunch of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also did sort of more general grower
culture videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the last, let's say,
half a dozen years or so, with lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a lot more exciting and diverse,
I've been doing a lot more grow journals
[SPEAKER_00]: and lighting reviews and playing with what
the industry's been coming out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been subscribed to your
channel since I believe it was 2013.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at your channel right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 261,000 subscribers and over 44
million views on the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So congrats on all your success there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really informative videos, great videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to your
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're tuned in on one of the
podcast platforms, just search his name
[SPEAKER_01]: Lex Blazer and his channel will pop right
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Chris is an OG of the channel for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually subscribed under the old
iteration of my channel that got deleted
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2014 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the new one you're looking at
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, Chris has been around a while for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny, there's been people
that comment on my videos and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you look exactly like Lex Blazer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, are you guys brothers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the same thing for FPS Russia.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoors, outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you in soil, cocoa,
organic, synthetic, synganic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So being a Canadian and having spent most
of my time in Chile, Northern Alberta,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely an indoor grower primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while I've dabbled in a few different
forms of hydroponics, I've tried deep
[SPEAKER_00]: water culture, I've tried aeroponics,
I've tried a little bit of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do grow mostly in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being is that I find most types
of hydro and cocoa to be a little bit too
[SPEAKER_00]: finicky for my taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a very low maintenance style type
of a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always try to see how far I can get
on the least number of man hours when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil suits me very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that standpoint, I don't maintain
organics, so I cannot call myself an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to call myself a synthetic
one, though I am a low nutrients type of
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, especially the past few years,
just because I feel that nowadays genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: have made such incredible progress that
you don't really have to slather on
[SPEAKER_00]: various newts for eye popping results,
at least if you're ultra careful about
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining all the other aspects of your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's I guess the kind of grower
I am overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the over fertilization is very,
very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, still to this day, even back in,
you know, 10, 12 years ago, when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: started, that was a common problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you mentioning that you feed real
low amounts, it makes sense, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are many like variables when
it comes to feeding, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: what medium you're using, which nutrient
line you're using, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can get away with a lot lower
doses and what's recommended on most
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, less, less is definitely more
nowadays, if you can get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more often than not, you'll find you
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into lighting for
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this episode is going to
revolve around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you currently using for
lighting over your plants and why that
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean, I've never had the luxury
for many years now of kind of growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: what I want to grow, I kind of grow
whatever shows up in the mail for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that the last bunch of years,
very consistently, what has been showing
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the mail that I've been wanting to
show up in the mail has been number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, number two, LEDs that are fanless.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been the second kind of thing
that's gone on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I found that nowadays I grow
with LEDs that are fanless that also give
[SPEAKER_00]: what's typically known as the white light
spectrum, which is a sort of natural
[SPEAKER_00]: listing looking light, not that reddish
purplish hue that most people associate
[SPEAKER_00]: with the older LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are typically LEDs that contain
3000K, 5000K, a little bit of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nicer ones also make some a little bit
of ultraviolet and infrared.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's been the general lighting
style.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been all LEDs for five years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what model grow lights are you
currently using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I am running a Mars Hydro as
well as a kind LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the recent past, I've tried out
some of G8's newer models because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: been a while since they came out with some
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the main ones lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it rotates quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been using the Electric Sky
ES300 by the Green Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one has been great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used some Spider Farmer, DSF2000 for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same way as you as far as like
companies are always offering to send me
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff to grow with and send on the
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, oftentimes they say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: More times, I typically say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are many companies that just
reach out to you, especially when you have
[SPEAKER_01]: such a large audience on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies want their grow lights to be
seen in front of that large audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm the same way with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these companies have sort of
figured out that there's a lot of names
[SPEAKER_00]: that come and go and they don't
necessarily mean an awful lot to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: casual people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way to get your lights known is to
have influencers, YouTubers, and so forth
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them into their hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certainly some brands in
particular, Spider Farmer, who've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: from total unknown four or five years ago
to being a fairly recognizable name today
[SPEAKER_00]: just off of that strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another one worth mentioning is
Viperspectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing on with one of their KS5000
right now, which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their new series, their KS series is just
really awesome up there as far as quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: But low budget pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're up there with the best of the
best, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just had Viperspectra on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I was growing with a TS1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or no, no, it was a P4000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was their big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, really good lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wouldn't know that it's one of the lower
budget lights that you can get in that
[SPEAKER_00]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these companies like
Viperspectra, for example, have had a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these grow lights just were less
efficient than some of your traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS, MH, CMH grow lights in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about LED grow lights,
how they were back in 2014, 2015,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they've evolved since then?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have a great video on your
channel about that, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what people have to
understand is LED lighting is a really new
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, especially as far as LED
lights that work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be the case that lighting was a
lot more expensive per watt in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost of the lighting fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were far less reliable because they
had more components back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single diode had more circuitry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be fans, which there aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The build quality used to be lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manufacturers simply didn't have any
experience because all of them were new to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, most importantly, the spectrum
has changed a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There used to be a really basic spectrum
and there wasn't really enough in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was too far removed from natural
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2014, 2015, a good LED light had
maybe three different colors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum, three different diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were mostly like a blue and a
red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a deeper red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all they kind of had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't work very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, what happened was spectrums got
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrums got refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build quality increased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actual true power efficiency in terms of
what these lights draw from the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: actually went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nowadays, they're truly half of HID or
even less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas before, saying that was kind of
like a stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you counted the ballast from the HID
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, the prices for the fixtures
themselves dropped dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimming was introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daisy chaining was introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LEDs became silent, slimmer,
brighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all just got better and better every
year since the 2014-2015 zone that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was right around the beginning of
2017 that I both mentally myself made the
[SPEAKER_00]: switch to LEDs and got to the point where
I was recommending them to others in most
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's overwhelmingly I recommend
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually made the switch back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one I had was a Platinum LED
P9XML2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm surprised I actually remember the
model number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that one actually worked really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had the Cree diodes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a really good yield off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I remember that has
changed over the years, which you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, was fans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They went from active cooling,
which a lot of people don't know active
[SPEAKER_01]: versus passive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Active cooling is when there's actually a
fan actively cooling the fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there would be fans throughout the
fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a fail point, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If a fan goes out, well then you could
actually potentially have an overheating
[SPEAKER_01]: issue with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to be a big fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's more passive cooling where
there's heat sinks, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's heat sinks which will allow the
heat to dissipate off of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The manufacturers have really been playing
a game the last few years where they try
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the diode intensity as high as
they possibly can without getting rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: the passive cooling in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been very successful,
particularly the last four years or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it seems like there's a split
between companies that are loading up the
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes and having a low amount of watts to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to increase the lifespan versus running
a lower amount of diodes, higher wattage,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really pushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's kind of that balance
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not forget about HID grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So HPS, MH, CMH, all those fall into high
intensity discharge or HID grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still used by many growers today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on those type of
grow lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so first off, I should point out
that a good quality HID bulb is still a
[SPEAKER_00]: terrific light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually in many ways second only to
sunlight, which is the best light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one issue with HID is of course the
electrical inefficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's becoming a bigger and bigger issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also they produce quite a bit of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be an issue for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also certain situations where you
still need to use HID.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, growers who live in areas
where the electricity isn't 100% reliable
[SPEAKER_00]: or steady, and there's still things like
offloading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking to a fellow who lives
in rural South Africa, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he wanted to use LEDs, but he couldn't
because that type of unsteady electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: flow will annihilate most LED fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just can't take those kind of
fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas HID is a ton more resistant to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this guy was still using HID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still use for HID.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that their spectrum is excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrical use though is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as high quality HID goes,
I do think that Gavita still leads the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as HIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that their bulbs contain a
spectrum that's so superior to every other
[SPEAKER_00]: HID, since every grow bulb oriented HID
gives off a decent spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they certainly have the best longevity
on their components.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the commercial growers use
them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still many commercial growers in
particular, the old school guys who've
[SPEAKER_00]: been around it a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're in a setting where the
lighting and the cost of the lighting is
[SPEAKER_00]: less of an issue for the overall grow,
they'll still stick to HIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think as the years go on and LEDs
are more and more popular, people are kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of forgetting about HID, you know,
HPS, MH, CMH.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have a place in here for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used HID grow lights, particularly I
used the MH and HPS for the first six
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I made that transition to LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did try CMH for a short period
of time as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I don't like about HID grow
lights is the light spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you've got that just a hot
spot down in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the outer edges really that the
part drops off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know that it is going to be the
reflector is going to have a big impact on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one thing I feel like that a
lot of these new LED grow light fixtures
[SPEAKER_01]: have a big leg up on them is being able to
evenly spread that light across the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint and also the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you touched upon that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, I would run a 600 watt
HID grow light in a four by four grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm able to run, I actually have like
230 watts going right now in a four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four, under 400 watts for a four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's covering that entire space very
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they still produce really good results.
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS, MH, CMH, but it seems like more and
more people are transitioning over to LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, there's a bunch to be said for
using your HPS and your metal halides and
[SPEAKER_00]: such like properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of a few tips I often give
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like first off, if you do go with HID,
do use a digital ballast, not a magnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: ballast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Digital ballasts are more efficient,
quieter, they produce less heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, the metal halide bulbs are
really only for vegetative phase guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't work well during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, the low budget folks who
could only afford one bulb and they'd buy
[SPEAKER_00]: an HID bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they'd actually do is they'd buy just
the HPS and they'd use it for vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: and flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was okay, but not ideal because
the metal halide bulbs have a slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: more of a blue tint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you just can't use the metal
halide during flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, like with HID bulbs,
your choice of reflector makes an enormous
[SPEAKER_00]: difference to the performance as well as
to the longevity of the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, for example, your hood reflectors
that have a glass covers to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those reflectors are more expensive and
they're heavier and a pain in the butt to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang, but they're just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing for hooking up ducts to them and
then getting all that excess heat out from
[SPEAKER_00]: all the lights out of the room,
which is really kind of important when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running, you know, 12, 16,
20 lights in a big room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got to dissipate that heat out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the main struggles that I
had living in a desert region is the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: that it produces, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to have the one with,
I mean, I had the wing reflector before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but having the actual cooling hood where
you could hooked up the ducting was so key
[SPEAKER_01]: for somebody like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a life changer and there
were all sorts of gorilla grows that were
[SPEAKER_00]: working with limited space, limited
ceilings, limited ventilation sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you had to take what you could
get for heat removal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though there are some downsides to
HID lighting, the flowers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: produced, that still some people's
argument today is the flowers are just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be so good, but let's get back to
LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your opinion, what makes a good LED
grow light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing I'll say is that nowadays
there are some pretty crappy lights that
[SPEAKER_00]: still get surprisingly good results just
cause they managed to get the spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: the diodes right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to discriminate too much
against any particular light, but
[SPEAKER_00]: generally what makes a good light is that
a good manufacturer, number one has a
[SPEAKER_00]: years long track record of making them and
they have high quality diodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: either a Samsung or Osram and they'll tell
you, you know, which ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, you want a good grow light
that has a minimum number of components
[SPEAKER_00]: because as we discussed earlier,
there's fail saves on those kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, the manufacturers have gotten
good about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want a light that dissipates heat
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want it to come with as many
features as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for LED lights, features means number
one, it's properly waterproofed,
[SPEAKER_00]: which some of the less expensive lights
might not be, but they come with
[SPEAKER_00]: waterproof designations that you can look
up to make sure that they're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do have to come with some basic
functionality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big one is dimming and it used to be
that there was no dimming, then there was
[SPEAKER_00]: dimming done with a screwdriver.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do it right and nowadays you kind
of should expect a proper dimming knob on
[SPEAKER_00]: an LED light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also want them to have a daisy
chain capability so you can tie a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's pretty much what it
entails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should note though, like I said,
you can get some amazing results out of
[SPEAKER_00]: lights that aren't impressive in many
other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And spending a thousand bucks in a light
and hanging it wrong is pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more often than not, it's not that a
person gets a bad light because there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many good lights on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that they get a good light and they
hang it incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, when dealing with LED
lights versus HID, you have to always bear
[SPEAKER_00]: in mind how much closer an LED light has
to be to the canopy in order to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: same kind of light intensity that an HID
will give you from a couple feet further
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing that I would add that
you hadn't mentioned is the light spread
[SPEAKER_01]: across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still some LED lights out there
that have the light focused towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: dead center of the footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it really drops off as you get to
those outer edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm talking like a thousand PPFD
dead center, but it drops down to like 200
[SPEAKER_01]: on the outer edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these companies are making the
bar style grow lights these days,
[SPEAKER_01]: which really helps spread that light
evenly across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the things I personally
look for that I personally think makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: good grow light these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally agree with that sentiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the weakness that LED lights
have had in the past was this kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: light spread concentration problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was especially bad a number of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this once fanless LEDs took off
and you could have a bar type light,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bar lights just exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now every manufacturer has a bar light
going on and they are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really do get the light spread even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you use an inexpensive thing like
the FC series by Mars Hydro, one of their
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, those don't cost an awful lot,
but because of the way they're designed
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're so wide, you get excellent
coverage right at the corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one other thing to probably get a
little bit deeper on is light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people put a lot of focus on
light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got the people on the
opposing side saying that spectrum isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: as important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more about the photon density coming
down onto the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on light spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: How important really is light spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the evolution of going
from blur pull to more white light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that really matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can people still grow with blur pull these
days?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my opinion is that light spectrum
does matter a lot and people can grow with
[SPEAKER_00]: blur pull, but they shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that light spectrum makes an
enormous difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot simply, you know, get your
light intensity up to 50,000 lux or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever with the wrong spectrum and
expect to get great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there are certain parts of the
spectrum that you absolutely have to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you hit them, you get most of the
way there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we arrived at these
white, yellow, red type of light
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that those are mandatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to hit those type of light
spectrums in order to get plants growing
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you really want them to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a way that honestly competes with
your high quality HIDs like Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my two cents on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm certainly not in the camp of a
spectrum doesn't matter and it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, if anything, I'm in the camp that
says that light intensity has been
[SPEAKER_00]: overdone with too much sales going on of
manufacturers going, oh, I can get it this
[SPEAKER_00]: high and I can get it that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not bothering to keep in mind,
well, the plant can't absorb anything
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond the certain amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's my two cents on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you on that last point where
you say it's like these lights are getting
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger and stronger, but the plants
aren't able to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some people out there that
are going to say, well, that just means
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to increase your nutrients and
dial in your environment a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: than your plant will be able to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, I mean, some of these grow
lights are going 2000 up to 3000 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these medicinal plants, they just get
fried off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in the top part of the plant
and it works its way down and it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: completely fried and you see a stunting
growth and a lot of folks think that they
[SPEAKER_01]: just need to increase the feeding and it
doesn't work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden they have a lack
of a harvest because they've so much
[SPEAKER_01]: damage to their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's sort of that kind of over
maximizing mentality and it exists not
[SPEAKER_00]: just in the lighting, but it exists in the
nutrients as well and it exists with CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like people think, oh, I'm going to get my
CO2 parts per million in the room up to
[SPEAKER_00]: like 1800, 2000 and that's going to do
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you will spend a ton of money on your
CO2 gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we touched upon quite a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many things that you can look
at when determining whether or not to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: LED go light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any particular grow lights or
grow light companies that you suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: people to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's break this down a little bit by
budget because budget is usually the the
[SPEAKER_00]: one differential for growers when it comes
to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the lower budget scale, try out a
Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I've said, I've grown with their lights
lots, including their more affordable
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, and I've had zero problems for all
the times I've run them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ditto for brands like Viperspectra and
Spider Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what all of those have in common is
those are all inexpensive Asian made
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, but they're quite good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those companies have a lot of
experience making them and they do use
[SPEAKER_00]: good quality diodes, which is kind of the
main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For your mid budget lighting, check out
Electric Sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you've said, I've used Electric Sky
ES180 and I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filizan, Growers Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a company called California
Lightworks, but that's almost getting
[SPEAKER_00]: closer to like medium high budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the high budget stuff,
there is of course HLG, the horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting group for their quantum board
style LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they make the highest and little flat
LED lights, but also the newer stuff by
[SPEAKER_00]: G8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people don't like the older G8 model
because it didn't have very good PAR,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the new stuff is very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously the manufacturing quality is
top notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been really impressed by the Kind LED
that I've been running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Grow Strong Industries, which is Kind
LED, is doing good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course Gavita, which don't only
make HID bulbs, but now they've gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: into the high-end LEDs, which for example,
their Gavita Pro 1700E is a bar style LED
[SPEAKER_00]: light, which is just a more heavy duty
version than what all of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: companies they just listed make.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so lots of options there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many companies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to mention all of them,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But taking that and flipping to the
opposite side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any particular grow lights or
grow light companies that you suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: people to avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look, my advice is this industry has an
odd sort of thing it does where companies
[SPEAKER_00]: show up, they make a name, they sell a few
lights, and then they either disappear or
[SPEAKER_00]: they change their name over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these companies are out of
China.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my advice is if you've never heard the
name before and it's got a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: syllables and the price is incredibly
cheap, avoid that manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be buying lights on eBay or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in doubt about a brand and
there's many of these kind of names that
[SPEAKER_00]: come and go, like Seyhan, RoliDro,
Galaxy Hydro, there's a bunch of these
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them sound like the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look up reviews instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: By which I mean reviews of somebody who
has actually grown with the light,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just did a spec review on camera of
just the hardware with a PAR meter without
[SPEAKER_00]: growing under it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you'll find is that you will get
a lot out of that review as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding the quality of the fixture
and whether it might be some PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nice thing is a lot of the light
brands that I wouldn't recommend,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't get them because they only
existed for 18 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three years ago, five years ago,
and now they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you haven't heard of a brand
repeatedly, look into it deeply because
[SPEAKER_00]: these brands rotate like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely some good advice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched upon measuring the light
output.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of different ways to go
about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lumens, PAR, just a couple to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: What method do you suggest for measuring
the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing I'll say is that the
majority of casual beginner at-home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, they don't need a light meter at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get by without one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some general guidelines for how
far to hang away lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often the lights themselves come with the
manual that gives you some rough idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can often just hang the light up
and you can check the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy and have it roughly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond that, just gauge the reactions
of the plants and adjust it up or down a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit based on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need a meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to meters, you've got
two types mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the meters that measure lumens or
lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a simple measure of light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Total light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's PAR meters, which measure
something called PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is photosynthetically active
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And PAR meters only measure the light that
your plants can actually utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they give you a much higher level of
precision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most growers at a higher level can
still actually get away with using a lumen
[SPEAKER_00]: meter for most functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all the lumen meter will really
tell you is whether you have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity or whether you might have too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're setting up a whole bunch of
lights in a room and you're wondering,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, am I putting them close together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I putting them too close to the canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: All you really need is a lumen meter to
determine that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beyond that, you know that the
spectrum and the PAR and so forth is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be OK because they're grower-oriented
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a couple of weaknesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a lumen meter doesn't work as
well with LED lights that have fewer
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not quite as precise on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lumen meter is not precise enough to
measure one light that's an LED light,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, against another light that's
an LED light and know exactly which one of
[SPEAKER_00]: them gives more of the light that plants
can actually use and utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, most people don't need a
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lumen meter gives them enough data and
information that most people can be happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a PAR meter is the most specific,
but most growers probably don't need them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually personally ended up investing
in a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the Apogee MQ-500 and then
eventually once the extended range meter
[SPEAKER_01]: came out, it's the Apogee MQ-620,
which actually I think they discontinued.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's the MQ-610, but it gives you that
extended range specifically for LED grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was one of those guys back in the
day which would unbox the light and hold
[SPEAKER_01]: the PAR meter underneath it and show what
the PAR measurements were, but didn't use
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I did that specifically for,
in my defense, did that specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: just to help out the viewers that were
buying those grow lights or potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: buying those grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because back then, and even still to this
day, there are companies that lie on their
[SPEAKER_01]: listing, specifically that PAR chart they
release, which shows kind of like an
[SPEAKER_01]: upwards diagram of the different PPFD
numbers across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many companies were called out in the past
for lying on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did was I got those grow lights,
took the PAR measurements at the different
[SPEAKER_01]: distances, and then showed it to my
audience and made them make their own
[SPEAKER_01]: decision on whether or not they wanted to
buy that grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also helped with like distance as well,
kind of seeing what the PPFD is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help them dial in that grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I ended up stopped doing those videos
a couple years back because, number one,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got tired of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there were some other guys out
there that do better reviews and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know what, just start watching
their videos because they do a better job
[SPEAKER_01]: than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also something to be said for
the fact that the exaggeration of the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings that you mentioned has improved
significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't exaggerate so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason is they don't have
to now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays they can shoot the PAR higher
than it needs to go, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are companies like Viper
Spectre, for example, that'll proudly put
[SPEAKER_01]: a lower number than their competitors
because of the fact that we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: too much light at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier we talked about too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put, really, they built their
fixtures for the right amount of light to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit the plants, you know, at their canopy,
where other grow lights, they're
[SPEAKER_01]: advertising, you know, 1200, 1500 plus
PPFD, which you really need CO2 in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to intake that amount of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these studies have showed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the PAR meter, another one worth
mentioning would be the spot-on PAR meter,
[SPEAKER_01]: which apparently shows very similar
readings to the Apogee meters,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if somebody's listening, maybe check
out spot-on meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are a lot of people using
phone apps now to do measurements,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tested any of the phone apps that
are out there to measure light output at
[SPEAKER_01]: all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've had a couple of the phone apps
approach me wanting to test them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some buddies who've tried more of
the phone apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used them too much just because
I have a PAR meter and I have a Lumen
[SPEAKER_00]: meter, so I just don't have much use for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my personal opinion is that I'm quite
skeptical of all the phone apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the majority of phones simply
lack the right hardware to figure out PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: or light intensity properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they're giving you is a really
rough type of idea instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on the plus side,
it's very cheap, but in my view,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're looking for the cheaper chicken,
so to speak, just get a Lumen meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like 35, 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not too expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think a lot of people can get away
with just that Lumen meter, like you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about the different stages of
growth, how much light do you suggest for
[SPEAKER_01]: the different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is probably kind of the meat
and potatoes for a lot of people watching,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what people really want to
know is exactly how much do they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I've mentioned in some of my own
videos, because of the selling by
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers and the anting up of lights
the past few years, some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: confused about the maximum that these
medical plants are able to handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I'll say that if you take
sunlight that's shining in the middle of a
[SPEAKER_00]: summer's day directly from overhead,
that's something to the tune of 95,000
[SPEAKER_00]: lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as we can tell, these plants
cannot handle more than half of that
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 45,000 lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So beyond that, at any stage of growth,
you're giving them more than they can
[SPEAKER_00]: really take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as how much they really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's first do this in lux and then in
par.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in lux, for vegetative phase,
you need somewhere from an absolute low of
[SPEAKER_00]: 8,000 lux to 13,000 lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people are surprised by how low
those numbers are, but it'll grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll work at those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering, you can do from a low of 10,000
lux to a high of 30,000 lux, though
[SPEAKER_00]: ideally you want to be closer to the high
rather than to the low because flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: will proceed at 10,000 lux, but isn't
going to yield right at 10,000 lux.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to hit close to the 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also have the ability to go the
whole way through at between about 25 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 28,000 lux for both veg and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants will be extremely
comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, there's no need to go
above 45,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we talk about par, par kind of
breaks down into three levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, there's the level of intensity
you'd want for your seedlings,
[SPEAKER_00]: your clones and your mothers that you're
trying to keep at low pace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're looking for about 250 to 400
for your readings for par.
[SPEAKER_00]: During vegetative phase, you're going to
want about four to 600 on your par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for flowering phase, you're going
to want between six and 900 per par,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe scraping towards a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've told people many times,
if you're going well above a thousand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting a whole lot for your
extra electrical input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we said, you can increase a little
bit what plants can handle by injecting
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 into the equation and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's no sense going into the
super high figures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not giving you a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are some good general
ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually use the same ones for par that
you use, but general ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what's important there is
some people stick to it real hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think that if they're going
outside of that at all, that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: failing, but the plant will still grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a plant in flowering where
you give it 400 to 600 PPFD and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: still grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the yield might not be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to die.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to experience any
particular deficiency as related to
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients because you're running it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just not needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen vegetative rooms that were
actually running at about 6,000 lux and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were running and everything was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was in a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, things can go low because
remember out in the real world,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants, things aren't always
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're slightly in the shade
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a tree nearby and they got to get
through all of that out in the natural
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cloudy days is another thing that can
affect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there are a lot of things that
can affect light intensity, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changes throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about DLI?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that a lot of people now
aim for is they look at the PAR numbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're also doing a calculation for
DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you look at DLI at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I actually don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't bother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was happy with once I got the PAR right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to be unhappy slightly with the
limitations of lumens, particularly as we
[SPEAKER_00]: started getting LEDs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I had PAR measurements,
I was happy with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you have to go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's my personal opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The general ranges that you recommend
falls within the DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 DLI is what a lot of people aim for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Upwards of 60 DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know there's some argument between
auto flowers and photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do the math on that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're staying on an 18.6 light cycle,
for example, and you've got 900 PPFD,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to give you about,
I think it's almost 60 DLI, which is kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of the top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those ranges you mentioned,
I think are good for both photo period as
[SPEAKER_01]: well as auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree or disagree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing is auto flowers kind
of confuse some elements of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a bit of an issue because auto
flowers are so popular now and they've
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of people who are brand
new to this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just getting started growing for
the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What tips do you have in regards to
lighting for those that are growing for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I often deal with a lot of
folks who email me because it's their
[SPEAKER_00]: first go around and they're having some
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, in the area of lighting,
the number one problem with lighting is
[SPEAKER_00]: often that the first time you set it up,
you allow a light leak to happen during
[SPEAKER_00]: the dark hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually one of the most common
mistakes I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So however you set up your lights,
do, you know, go into your tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn on the lights outside the tent and
make sure there's no light leaks into
[SPEAKER_00]: there because those can really hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beyond that, don't get the distance
wrong, which is a common mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most often with LED lights, people hang
them too far away and they lose a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: light intensity over the distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: While those growing with HID lights often
hang the lights too close and they cause
[SPEAKER_00]: heat stress at the canopy and they often
don't discover that it's happening until
[SPEAKER_00]: either the leaves start to cop on them a
little bit or the buds develop bleaching,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of this pure whiteness right
near the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's undesirable and it means that your
lights are too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, when it comes to newbies who
set up multiple lights, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes that get made.
[SPEAKER_00]: People often will put lights way too close
to one another and overshoot what they
[SPEAKER_00]: need for PAR and overshoot how many lights
they need in a certain square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they think it's not a big deal,
but here they are spending every single
[SPEAKER_00]: day 30% more electricity than they got to
spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where something like a light
meter of any kind might come in handy a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit to see just how much you're
overshooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I will say to all people who are new
to it, the reason I spend so much time
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with lighting on my channel is
lighting is that important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the be all end all of indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make all sorts of mistakes that
your plants will survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if for whatever reason your
lights go off for three, four days,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to really be punishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also don't overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overload your breakers guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: A breaker is often rated for at most 1500
watts and you really don't want to run
[SPEAKER_00]: more than 1200 watts on it when you're
running it most of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just bear that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Safety first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some really good tips for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, as I said, I'm Lex Blazer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a channel by that name with a
pretty big video library that goes back a
[SPEAKER_00]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much any topic within this niche
that you want to look up if you search it
[SPEAKER_00]: up combined with my name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Odds are I've done an episode on it
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can still find me there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, I'm also on something called
Lex's Lounge where I talk about sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of other topics beyond just
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what I've been doing a
little more of the last two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely have a link to Lex's
channel down in the description section
[SPEAKER_01]: below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
garden talk podcast episode and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: love for you to tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lex, thank you so much for coming onto
this episode today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really good information about
lighting that I think is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable to a lot of people listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for coming onto the
podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
