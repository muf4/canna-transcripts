[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity just launched a brand new
series of grow lights called the Ion
[SPEAKER_00]: Frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me the Ion Frame Evo 3 LED grow
light, which is great for a 2 foot by 4
[SPEAKER_00]: foot coverage area, but they also have
grow lights for other size coverage areas
[SPEAKER_00]: such as the Evo 4 for a 3 by 3,
Evo 6 for a 4 by 4, and the Evo 8 for a 5
[SPEAKER_00]: by 5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and today I have a product highlight video
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a brand new series where we
highlight some of the best gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: products on the market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I'll talk a little bit
about the Ion Frame LED grow light while I
[SPEAKER_00]: unbox the unit, so you can learn more
about it and see what comes in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a discount code for this grow
light, code MRGROW15, that actually works
[SPEAKER_00]: for all AC Infinity grow lights and all of
their products in their hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_00]: growers category, as well as their grow
accessories category.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon opening the box, I noticed that they
put some information on the inside flap
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out the box is the driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This driver can be mounted on the fixture
or can be kept off the fixture and kept
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of your grow space, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulling out the grow light from the box
and then opening up this smaller box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside this box is a UIS M2M 10 foot cord,
UIS M2M 2 foot cord, stainless steel wire
[SPEAKER_00]: hangers, a wire tie set, hook and loop
ties, various screws for mounting,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some rope ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the driver extension cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the driver brackets in case you
want to mount the driver to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the schedule controller where you
can set daily light schedules and even
[SPEAKER_00]: simulate sunrise and sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, they include a user manual and
an intro to growing book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing I noticed when handling
the light is that is extremely light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frame is actually magnetic,
so you can pair the Ion Frame with the Ion
[SPEAKER_00]: Beam light bars if you choose to provide
supplemental full spectrum or UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unit pulls 280 watts from the wall at
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diodes on this fixture are Samsung
LM301H EVO diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Samsung's latest diode and is top
of the line in horticultural lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: These diodes are very efficient and
algorithmically placed on a bar style
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture to emit a uniform full spectrum of
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Efficiency comes in at 3.14 micro moles
per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the user manual, they show you how to
hang the fixture, although I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: like to do it a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use two light ratchet hangers only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply loop each light ratchet hanger over
the top of the grow tent bar, then connect
[SPEAKER_00]: each end to the grow light as I'm doing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it so much easier to move the
light up and down by simply holding onto
[SPEAKER_00]: one side of the fixture while pulling the
rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is part of the UIS platform,
so you can connect it to a controller 69
[SPEAKER_00]: or controller 69 Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the UIS M2M cord, which is 10
feet long, to connect from the driver to
[SPEAKER_00]: my controller 69 Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then go to the AC Infinity app,
tap on the controller in my 2x4 for port
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, which is a port that the light is
connected to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm changing it from off to schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm then setting the start time for when
the light should turn on, then setting the
[SPEAKER_00]: stop time for when the light should turn
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, to set the dimmer percent,
I'm going from schedule to on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The setting of 6 shown here is 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to change it to 5 for now,
which is 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, I'm going back to schedule so that
the light will turn on and off according
[SPEAKER_00]: to what I've set.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity recommends hanging this grow
light at least one foot above your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and to set your percentage to 40% for the
seedling stage, 80% for the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: stage, and 100% for the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The height will vary based on the plant
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show the coverage area for all of the
LED grow lights in their Evo series in
[SPEAKER_00]: their user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, I have the Evo
3, which has a flowering coverage area of
[SPEAKER_00]: 2 feet by 4 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have other grow lights for larger
spaces, such as 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is more to this grow light,
