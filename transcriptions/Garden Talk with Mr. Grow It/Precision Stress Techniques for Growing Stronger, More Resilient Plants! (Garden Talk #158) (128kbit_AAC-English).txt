[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 158.

grows a variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's big into stress testing plants,
which is what we get into in today's
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from the types of precision
stress, benefits, how he goes about the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stress techniques, and more.

[SPEAKER_00]: We are back, and I'm joined with Ames High
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually met in person at MJBizCon
2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what an event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really cool to meet you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was a good vibe, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was super crazy to see all you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Huge honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about having you come on the
podcast, and I asked you, what do you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about, and things that you
specialize in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said a bunch of different things,
but you really like to focus on hunting
[SPEAKER_00]: and also precision stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really perked up my ears a little bit
because precision stress, I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's talked about enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that you can do to stress out the
plant that actually results in better
[SPEAKER_00]: things happening to the plant,
whether it be stressing to cause more
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, making it more a heartier
plant, more vigorous, more resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: pest pathogens, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into all of that in
this episode, what you do to stress out
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants and what you're looking for in
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can we do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Ames High Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been gardening for almost 20 years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a huge passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started off as a hobby and then saw the
science behind everything, and it really
[SPEAKER_01]: just became a big drive and a dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I never thought of it as far as
I have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about some plants, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about this, how I grow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, what is your overall growth
style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoor, outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you soil, cocoa, hydro?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really started outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did not do too good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of mold, a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just did not like fighting mother nature,
so kind of moved indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really use a lot of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use Pro-Mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the other brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, no, it's mainly Pro-Mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Pro-Mix for the win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the straight cocoa, and then I'll add
in my own perlite and a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: things to make it nice and airy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is when I preferably grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to the science side of
things, I grow in all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because especially when I'm chasing
certain stress factors, it's easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: hone in on maybe a pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm doing droughts, I use a lot of
pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use mostly organic inputs,
or are you doing synthetic, or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: synganic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I jump around a lot with that one too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a matte ADHD, got to keep moving,
got to do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: My main go-to is really a synganic
approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have been dabbling in more
organics as of recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shied away from it in the beginning
because I wasn't really too keen on the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole time release.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get this mix in right,
so everything breaks down at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't too fond of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't play with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to do a lot of salts and
chase something that is really resisted
[SPEAKER_01]: against your salts, you can't do that in
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, getting the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using both organic and synthetic
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into stress, what are the benefits
to doing these precision stress
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: The overall idea is you want to find the
most resilient plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most resilient plant to all of these
types of stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find more leniency in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be as worried about your
plant getting some type of, we'll just use
[SPEAKER_01]: a tobacco mosaic or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: More resilience to something like that,
you don't have to worry about it spreading
[SPEAKER_01]: as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that you shouldn't still
practice cleanliness in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always practice that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never use the same scissors on two
different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because it is resilient doesn't mean
you should just give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole idea is for it to go into bigger
commercial facilities and then find more
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits and less problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do your wind training, your wind
training will get a bigger structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get more yield from it depending
on if you can find that more resilient
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that can handle that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get more structure, better,
stronger branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: The watering is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The root system is really what's happening
for the droughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your root system is creating a bunch of,
we'll say pockets inside of the roots that
[SPEAKER_01]: are really holding that water so when
there is no water, they can re-drink that
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's biochemical pathways or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never remember the actual term.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a bunch of benefits to these.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just because I like causing my
plants a bunch of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is when you breed with them after
you induce these stresses and you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding through the line and you keep
going on and you find these traits and you
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt out the most resilient ones,
you can turn around, breed that into say a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that you like and you can try pull
that trait from that plant into a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit more breeding into it
than is what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole idea in a general term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some folks will do precision stress
techniques in order to get more secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites to be formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these stress factors actually
lead to more trichome production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing these medicinal plants,
that's what a lot of people are really
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming for is the trichome production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to mention that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple different stress
factors, biotic and abiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break down the differences?
[SPEAKER_01]: Biotic will mainly be your outside
sources, really like your natural stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant will have fungi, it'll have
viruses, it'll have bugs, all of that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more of your biotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your abiotic will be your heat from your
light, your droughts, your salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other ones.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pruning, transplanting goes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind stress is all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical stress is what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think you said salinity as well,
the salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flooding, drought, light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go into detail on both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll start off with abiotic,
which is I think more commonly used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, maybe start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you stress the plants at all using
temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how do you stress them and what do
you look for in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heat is one that I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use, because a lot of people will have
that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see a lot of tip burns and a lot of
growths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it doesn't matter where you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see at home growths, you can see
them at commercial growths.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see tip burns all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been chasing heat as one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crank up the light mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just crank up the light to everything
she gots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add the wind, try to keep it in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relatively nice, but where it's still nice
and hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is I'll start breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw a couple plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breed them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let a first cycle come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already know all the first cycle is
going to be ... Breed them again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not reversing any of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep them as open as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to keep that genetic pull,
we'll say, as open as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get a bunch of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say I start with something that has
already been locked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say use a medical plant as examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll find F6s and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use something like that,
you're not going to find a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity because they've already locked
it into certain types of traits that they
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want other traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: We start from the top, get them going,
keep them cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're cycling, you'll start finding
certain plants will produce traits that
[SPEAKER_01]: are more resilient to these factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the heat, an example, you won't see a
bunch of tit burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be nice, flush, green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other plants alongside of it, you'll see
that they're burning, so you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still doing the right type of
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still inducing that stress to the
point where other plants are naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to find that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more or less for the heat one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do wind as well because I like seeing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of benefits from the wind
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add a bunch of air, for example,
the way I do it is I grab a box fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds crazy, but I'll just take a box
fan, crank it on as high as I possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: can, and I literally will sit it right in
front of the plants, just blasting it,
[SPEAKER_01]: blasting it to the point where the plants
are just all sorts of droopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep doing that to help build up,
what do I always forget the name of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cellular wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, it's like breaking your arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you break a bone, or fracture it,
to be precise, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you fracture a bone, it'll heal over
time, and it'll heal stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these branches and stuff,
with most common plants that we all love,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you add in fractures, micro-fractures
along these branches, they will come back,
[SPEAKER_01]: heal stronger, and it helps promote more
flow through those branches so you get
[SPEAKER_01]: more energy going to the output of your
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of biotic stressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually introduce a lot of PM into the
grow because I'm trying to find PM
[SPEAKER_01]: resilience so I can breed that into other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That PM resilience is the same way as that
you would do for your light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to start trying to find
something that's resilient to that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: trait, you do the same thing for your
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one has a lot of ups and downs
because once you start bringing in molds
[SPEAKER_01]: and bugs and all kinds of other stuff,
it's really hard to start keeping track of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, making sure it's contained in one
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start having to do a lot of other IPMs
and stuff like that, really trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigate any type of spread so you don't
have this test happening over here,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you spread that mold into
something over here that you didn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: the mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PM, that's pretty interesting that
you actually introduce it in to stress the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant out and just see if it's resistant
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break that down in details?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you actually do to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just increase the humidity and
cause PM to occur?
[SPEAKER_00]: In one area and then bring that plant into
another area to see if it infects another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the detail on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I work at a commercial facility as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to a lot of other commercial
facilities just trying to help out,
[SPEAKER_01]: give them some insight that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that I know in the
commercial facilities are dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain PM big issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I still have some of the soil for the
fungus gnats, because that's another one
[SPEAKER_01]: that I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: still some of the soil from them,
just the top two inches because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where the fungus gnats are laying all
their eggs and that's where a good amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of the activity happens for them,
top two inches of that, and then still a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch that is infected with PM,
something that is heavy infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that, bring them both back in,
take your bugs, put them in your bug site,
[SPEAKER_01]: take that branch and literally just put it
into the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add it into the room, add a lot of wind in
there and let it do a natural thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: PM will naturally spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm trying to stay as natural as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to literally just go in there
and rub the PM plant on them because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to spread naturally so it tries
to fight it naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, it would be the plant next to
it or itself, I guess, but the plant next
[SPEAKER_01]: to it catches PM, it's likely to catch it
as well because it's going to spread over.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my whole idea with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually the first person I ever
heard of doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of, I had a buddy in
Massachusetts who grew out Chilladogee
[SPEAKER_00]: along with a whole bunch of other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He always struggles with high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a lot of his plants got PM,
but the Chilladogee, which was in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: room, didn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dude, I need to show you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, this is resistant to PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, dude, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got at least one plant that
wasn't infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy that it was actually the strain
that I bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you sharing that with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is something that I know that quite a
few growers do look for resistance to
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens such as PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to back up to temperature to get
a little bit more into detail on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about heat, blasting with heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperature, what heat do you go up
to in order to see if the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Around the 96 to 98 zone because I don't
want to push too far past 98 because most
[SPEAKER_01]: things will burn at 98 regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really that maximum threshold and I
only keep it there for maybe five minutes
[SPEAKER_01]: tops and then I'll bring it back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I explain this?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look out in nature, nature is
always different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light penetration that we're getting
from the sun is always different,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the day, it will change.
[SPEAKER_01]: At certain peaks in the day, there might
be times that there's super hot heat just
[SPEAKER_01]: beaming down on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep it as natural as
possible without going too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, if you push the limits too
far, that's just unnatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you start pushing the unnatural
limits, what's the point of what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I sit here and try to find a plant that
goes up to 100 and something, some crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: number, that's cool and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my eyes, that's a waste of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're not going to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to find a single moment
in time outside where your surface
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is going to be over 120
degrees or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know one of the things that
folks look for when they're doing heat
[SPEAKER_00]: stress is they look for plants to flip
over and show intersex traits or
[SPEAKER_00]: maffrodite plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for the plant to
potentially show nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders in particular, they will just
scrap that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll call it off and they won't use it
for future breeding projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also looking for certain types of fox
tailing because there's certain strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that after heat is induced, there's a lot
of fox tailing that will occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to find the one that won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like fox tailing sometimes because it
looks cool, but otherwise for your overall
[SPEAKER_01]: production, nah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are mixed opinions on fox
tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people hate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people feel like it leads to a more
arrier structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like the bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people who wash and they said
they get a better result washing because
[SPEAKER_00]: of more looser arrier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's coming from the fox tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got people who love it and people
who hate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to look at in my eyes,
but otherwise besides that, that's not for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me living in the desert,
I encounter it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sometimes tough, specifically in the
summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always reaches 80 degrees Fahrenheit
and I'm lucky to keep it under 82 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it creeps up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately, in the new household here,
I just moved in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little bit better of cooling
situation, so I am able to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my last place, man, it was touching 86
plus degrees and I'd see a lot of fox
[SPEAKER_00]: tailing happening on some genetics because
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all genetics will fox tail,
but definitely a good amount will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the heat definitely can contribute
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I know infrared light, excess
infrared light, I think 5% or more,
[SPEAKER_00]: 7% or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually lead to fox tailing as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ES300 LED grow light by Green Sunshine
Company, rest in peace that company no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer exists, but that was a very popular
light and their first version had a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: IR in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of genetics were fox tailing because
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were like, what the heck is going
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: He revised it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He put out a V2 with actually less IR in
it and that actually helped to solve the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure that was worthy of mentioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said a few things for lighting,
but if we can get deeper into that amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of light and spectrum of light,
some people will just blast it with excess
[SPEAKER_00]: light to try to stress their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people will give certain spectrum in
order to stress the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do in regards to
light stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of, I switch between.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bunch of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the, what are they called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Bob lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS and MH?
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many abbreviations,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a thousand watt of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run that in a four by four.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Max that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole lot of heat coming off that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm constantly running an AC by it to
try to keep them temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I a hundred percent understand what you
mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live a high desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the summertime, I feel you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I don't want it too high,
it starts reaching up in them higher
[SPEAKER_01]: levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, okay, I guess we're doing a
higher test today, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do switch it between that and LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an LED 650 Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crank that and I swap them in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mars Hydro I bring closer to the plant
because I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard it back in the day that it's a
good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could run them closer and like
some, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stick to what I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I keep switching them between that
because of that same, that same sentence
[SPEAKER_01]: that I was saying earlier, like go
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never get this in type of light
penetration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So switching between LED and HID.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got the different spectrums there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you have a PAR meter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you measuring the amount of light that
is being emitted onto the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you increasing that to see if
it stresses the plant or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a PAR meter, broke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started using the app on the,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Photon app, I think with the piece of
paper and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm currently trying to get a new one,
but yeah, I usually do test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it a Brics meter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a Brics meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brics refractometer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm bad with names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a big sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have brought that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have brought that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always messing up on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually every show, it doesn't matter what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least one thing I forget, I like to
bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to bring the sheet so I can
tell you literally, like I have a chart
[SPEAKER_01]: that I write down everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this month I'm running this and
these were the results, always taking
[SPEAKER_01]: notes because if I don't take notes,
then how am I going to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been about a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently switched to stop taking notes
and actually recording so I can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire plant and I can like literally have
the evidence of what's happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: go through time, date it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's technically my notes now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be so helpful to take videos and
pictures and have those as your notes or
[SPEAKER_00]: documentation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have been filming my plants for nine
years now and I can look back on my hard
[SPEAKER_00]: drive and see the plants that I grew back
in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting to see the different
growth and like remind myself of what that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant looked like, how it grew,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: One mistake I made is actually organizing
that footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing like 2015 vlog one,
vlog two, vlog three, and just dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: footage in there of all different plants,
I had to go back and organize it to
[SPEAKER_00]: different folders by strain really or
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that way I can look and see,
okay, when I grew out the Gelato 41 back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross, let me look into that folder and I
can see everything about that versus
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to dig back at a certain year at a
certain vlog number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned my lesson on that one,
but I totally get what you mean by filming
[SPEAKER_00]: or taking pictures of it, how that can be
helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kept losing all my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have, what are those,
you know the books that don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: wire going around it and they're usually
like black and white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those like perfect binding ones,
I think they're perfect binding,
[SPEAKER_01]: they aren't the ring binder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know which ones I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a stack like this of all my notes
that I've been taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost half that stack in multiple moves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so dang, I got to start recording
stuff because I just put it on a cloud and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I always have access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's get into drought stress next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you do any type of drought stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how do you do it and what do you
look for in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with my drought stressing, I do pure
cocoa, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will water it one day,
let it run, stop, about the third day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The third day is when it's really gonna
need your water and you're gonna start
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing that droop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave it that full saturation,
on that third day, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running in three gallons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: On that third day, you should start seeing
your plant drooping down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you know that that's about how
long you can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will stretch it farther and farther
and then start seeing what plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: reacting the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, that's the ones that
I'll start breeding with, the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: are more resilient to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that plant because I want that
and I'll breed it and I'll try to find
[SPEAKER_01]: that trait in that plant again the next
cycle and you just keep doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is just to find something that I
could potentially water it this one day
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go with maybe like a four to five
day stretch without watering and it still
[SPEAKER_01]: be just barely at that droopy point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the real pinnacle of what I'm
looking for because with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it gives people the time period of
say you have to go to work and you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: really go into your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay, tomorrow, just catch back up
onto it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it gives your plant a little bit
more time and more leniency for neglect,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the whole reason, honestly,
like I got into growing was I watched my
[SPEAKER_01]: mom when I was a little kid, she used to
love gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just used to be mad all the time
because she did not have a green thumb and
[SPEAKER_01]: bless her soul, she tried so much,
but she would forget to water it and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was the main issue for her, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always wanted to find a plant
that was like super resilient to it like
[SPEAKER_01]: cactus, you know, a cactus is cactus.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of them, but like cactus
is the most notorious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that live out in the desert go
forever without water, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Still do perfectly fine, have juices
running in them, like come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the flip side, flooding is a type
of sort of really over-watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people call it instead,
adding so much water in there that the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium's oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of that stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how do you do it and what do you
look for in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I do that one with my bug
stress, with the fungus nets, because when
[SPEAKER_01]: you get all that excess moisture in your
medium, that's really what your,
[SPEAKER_01]: those little...
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm sorry, that's what those little
bugs like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not like those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pain and pain to keep it like contained,
they always spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really just goes back in that same
basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can find that there's more plants
that when you are watering them,
[SPEAKER_01]: more excessively, you'll start getting a
bunch of like toxicities and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what your feed is and stuff
like that, you'll start running into all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plant will start turning all
kinds of colors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually leads me into like the cold,
because I do cold as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cold temps, I try to water with colder
water sometimes as well to see which one's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna react the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to avoid the purpling in our
medical plants and know what does it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the tomato sometimes does the purpling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other plants that it does
it as well, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do this at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you look for in the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a meter technically to
read my salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really just run at a higher PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM or EC is what people measure by those.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just run at a lot higher one for that
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'll push into the threes and
fours instead of like the average 1.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to get as high as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stack, do a lot of bottom feeding for
that type of test to try to pull up the
[SPEAKER_01]: salts so they stay in there and stack up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mainly how I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant's growing, are you looking
for like excessively dark leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: curling, nitrogen, toxicity, for example,
and then are you like pulling off the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that aren't able to handle that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you see it or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's literally what you said,
literally all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nitrogen is mainly the one that I'm
looking for though, because I find that
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen issue is the biggest issue in
my eyes that a lot of like home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with because they don't pull off the
nitrogen when they're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they start at like having accesses
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the issues start lying
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really that's, that is literally what
I am searching for when it comes to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that stress test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know running a higher EC can
actually stunt the growth as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant might look nice and green and
healthy, but like it stays, it stays,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth has been stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume that's another thing you look
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally been two weeks, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sits there looking healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, that one gets me sometimes too,
because like I have so much going on and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go in there, check on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this test is working this tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then come back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you guys aren't moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives me all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of my hydroponic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in soil for 14 years and then
just tried hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I've learned is,
from somebody else that had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that, sure, you can try to run a higher
EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really going to see nutrient
burn as you would in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's not as apparent, but you'll see
more of a slowed growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what, when I was
reaching these higher EC touching upward
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2.0 EC, some people say that's
excessive for running in hydro deep water
[SPEAKER_00]: culture to be more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: People said you can get away with the
smaller one and any higher than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could actually see stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually backed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And went down in order to try to prevent
that stun of growth from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's literally why I'm trying to get
into soil and stuff, because it does give
[SPEAKER_01]: you that quicker reading on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shout out to bio biz because bio biz is
really, they hooked me up with a starter
[SPEAKER_01]: kit of, uh, they have some liquid organic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna try that soup, see what
that's all about and run a couple tests,
[SPEAKER_01]: see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to mechanical stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that fall under this would be
like pruning, for example, training,
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally I will prune it at your six
shoot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most plants, once it gets like it's
six shoot, you prune it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets a little bit more growth and
then you naturally prune it depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of plants that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's depending on really how much you
want to prune it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the medical plant, six shoot,
two weeks after that, and then two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: before you flip it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really the standard that I've ran
by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but when it comes to the test,
I'll, I will prune that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll prune it every week just to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really what I'm looking for is it to
herm out when I push it into flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's like a common one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, lack of, lack of development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll get a lot of like,
like tops and stuff, but like they'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: be little guys, little guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that's something that I,
again, if I see those two things,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll kill them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm really looking for something I can
prune as often as, uh, there's a bush
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like a bonsai.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome little bush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, you have to prune that thing
all the time though, because it grows
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm looking for something like
that, because if we can get that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: vigor, right in the plant and still be
able to prune it, top it, get it like
[SPEAKER_01]: just, just constantly chopping at it,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is we get it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we get massive yields off that one
plant because we can train it easily,
[SPEAKER_01]: easily, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bend your branches down and like your
wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come down, get plenty of crazy
tops everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll just be amazing, but a lot of
plants can't handle that kind of training.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some people do some crazy things
when it comes to training and topping,
[SPEAKER_00]: stripping down all the leaves to foliation
and really just having it mostly naked,
[SPEAKER_00]: take almost every single leaf off of the
plant, then flipping a flower and let that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you don't even think the
plant is going to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you see their progress weeks
later and the plant grows just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see kind of how much
you can actually take off the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it rebounds and is able to grow and
get to harvest from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, the, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Swazi swaz method, however it's
pronounced, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like that, but I like pushing it a
little bit farther, like really pushing it
[SPEAKER_01]: to its real max, just to see how far I can
go to push that specific genetic or
[SPEAKER_01]: strain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, to its max.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way I can put it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying, like even at,
even at commercial facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is one of the funnest things to do,
teaching people how to like cut back a mom
[SPEAKER_01]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes just go over there, grab the
plant, little bundle it up and then take,
[SPEAKER_01]: go down half of it, take some floppers and
chop half of it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks disgusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant looks like it's going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody freaks out the first time they
see it and like, just give it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, comes back even bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we can start that at a,
at a, a younger like age in the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: development and it not have detrimental
like problems, then that's what I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that'd be key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a keeper for you, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to another thing that
you spoke about, which is the fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could take it soil from, from a
commercial facility that had a fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats introducing into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly are you trying to get out of
doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get into the science
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants, when they are being attacked by
certain types of pests, they, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethyl methylene can never remember,
remember the actual chemical that it
[SPEAKER_01]: starts to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will produce this, this
chemical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To try to fight them off and in doing so
it usually results in like a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene yield or something, something
along that sort, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what type of insects that you
are really introducing is really depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on what type of, um, we'll say pheromone
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never remember the name of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is you build that resistance
and that resistance is shown in your
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and a certain types of oil
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm saying that right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can correct me if I'm wrong,
could be wrong with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one is really just a newer test that
I've been, I've been playing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of the people introducing
fungus gnats for a stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you introduce them and they're,
you know, you've got the population going,
[SPEAKER_00]: say you're done with the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get rid of the fungus gnats?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a zero tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause it really works as like a,
uh, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: A sterilizer is zero tall 2.0 is what I
really keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep a gallon of that thing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's essentially like a peroxide,
just a high concentrated version of
[SPEAKER_01]: peroxide and keep that down, throw all
everything away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spray everything down, clean
everything, bleach everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the buckets, clean those out,
make sure that the soil that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: our has been contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you bring that away from your
home facility, wherever you're doing your
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not, do not let that state sit around
because if it sits around and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still moisture in it, then they just keep
breeding and it will spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good luck after that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a brave man for introducing fungus
gnats intentionally the stress testing
[SPEAKER_00]: because me personally, I struggle with
fungus gnats and I just want them gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I understand what you're, uh,
what you're going for there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some challenges when it comes to
doing some of these precision stress
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, don't think that you're going to
have a good yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your yield is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, spreading, uh, any type of content
like contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another big problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, honestly, those are like the biggest
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are like the really biggest ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you burn through a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't like doing all of these tests and
trying to get to your end result.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will, we'll say like this,
you do 10, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to keep one if
you're lucky, if you're lucky off that
[SPEAKER_01]: run, if you're lucky off that run,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to stay in a regular,
um, a regular kind of idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you have to stay with non-feminine,
nice stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you want to keep that diversity,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to start 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one survives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all 10 plants that you ran
throughout this entire test that you
[SPEAKER_01]: probably was might've thought that maybe
one is going to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He might be able to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no, no more often than not
you're killing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you starting from seed and only doing
seeds or are you doing clones as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeds and clones are a lot of,
seeds and clones, um, specifically like
[SPEAKER_01]: you start off from your seed to keep that
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then depending on what type of tests
you want to run, you would cut the clone
[SPEAKER_01]: from that and then cut your clone from
your male as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can keep them those types,
those specific genetic, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pools, we'll say genetic pools together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you got your clones,
take your clones and put them in different
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine you are, uh, letting the
plant grow up from seed, cutting the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones, having the clones off to the side,
pushing some to testing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Precision stress testing, keeping the ones
that you have cloned, you have them kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not stress, uh, stressing some and
you're stressing the others or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, if I, if I start one strain,
um, a hundred percent already know from
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning, I'm going to test this
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know for a fact that I'm not,
we're going to run this for any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical use or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will grow that out to about,
about yay tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally as soon as I got like four
branches on that plant, I will cut off
[SPEAKER_01]: three of them and then I'll leave that one
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those three other branches set one to
the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other, the other two right into
testing that main plant right into testing
[SPEAKER_01]: that one I'll save, um, as the control
because you got, uh, I use that pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pruning method for that first one,
the mom, that is that prune.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the one that I will consistently
go back and sit here and chop away at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of the plants I'll push into the
PM room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other plant I'll push into,
um, the bug room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have the control room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next question I want to ask as we
get towards the end here, what are the top
[SPEAKER_00]: three genetics that you've grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: As in like for the resistant traits or
just top three that I personally enjoy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top three in your opinion, what you enjoy
kind of maybe name off the strain and
[SPEAKER_00]: then, uh, kind of what you like about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Afghani because that is an, um,
that's a really good drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown, I've grown that a couple of
times, like the original Afghani,
[SPEAKER_01]: not like any of the crossed Afghanis,
like the original land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I found that that one fights.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of droughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that goes back to how it was
initially like bred out and found,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like they used to grow it in big
fields and then they would flood the,
[SPEAKER_01]: they dig canals right along the sites of
each, each row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they just flood it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how they did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as that, that ground would dry out
often and then they just come back,
[SPEAKER_01]: flood it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it builds so many traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It built so many resistances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think this is really why we know it
is what it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like it works for a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another one, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I like blue dreams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not because it's resilient to
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a pain for a lot of people to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is not a beginner strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and my eyes personally, um,
I just like the way it tastes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for a third one, Alaskan
Thunderfuck, the ever like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the legendary, how it's everybody's
like, no, it's not real.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not Alaskan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm looking for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it one time and gold, gold classic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big lamb race guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I ask that question is
because we have a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: tuning into this that are shopping for
genetics and they like to hear what other
[SPEAKER_00]: people are growing and their experiences
kind of growing that or what they like
[SPEAKER_00]: about those particular genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you revealing that to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sure we could go on and on,
but we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell, listen to how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can find me on YouTube,
Instagram, really honestly, any platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand, I try to stay in touch with the
community as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got a bunch of bunch of events that
I'm about to be starting up, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow alongs competitions, you know,
all kinds of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure to follow it's going to be
crazy.
