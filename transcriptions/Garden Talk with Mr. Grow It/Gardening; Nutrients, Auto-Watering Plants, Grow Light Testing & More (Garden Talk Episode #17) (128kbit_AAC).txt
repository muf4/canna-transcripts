[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's much better for a plant to
have slightly less nutrients and work your
[SPEAKER_00]: way up than to basically force your plant
into a nutrient lockout through that
[SPEAKER_00]: osmotic process and then have to reel it
back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's these EC fans coming out right now
which basically can operate with digital
[SPEAKER_00]: controls which can make them work a lot
better with controllers and they operate
[SPEAKER_00]: on way less wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in the summer I'm always adding
CO2 and people are like oh what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy CO2 operation you got going in there
and I'm like dude it's a 4x4 tent just get
[SPEAKER_00]: an exhale bag or two hang it up you'll be
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there are any home growers out there
who are like you know what I love doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this I want to do this for a living I want
to make a career out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start reading manuals on a lot of the
technology watch a whole bunch of videos
[SPEAKER_00]: and read some manuals on how they work and
you're you're basically halfway there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grout and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Nate Lipton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nate is the owner of growshouse.com which
is one of the largest grow equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: suppliers in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is also the host of Canna Cribs a show
where they tour various cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nate grows plants in both a small
greenhouse located in his backyard as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as an indoor grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows a wide variety of plants such as
leafy greens melons broccoli cauliflower
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal herbs and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk about a wide variety of topics
in this video from nutrients to auto
[SPEAKER_01]: watering to feeding charts to LED grow
light tests and a new product that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming onto the market soon.

that was established in Amsterdam back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the early 90s and as of a few years ago
their products are now available here in
[SPEAKER_01]: the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have base nutrients additives pH
regulators really anything needed for
[SPEAKER_01]: proper plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Pro is now officially a long-term
sponsor of the podcast so you'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing their name a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave a link to their Amazon store

[SPEAKER_01]: Alright now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright here we are Nate from Growers
House.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty well Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've known each other for a little
while now right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We met in MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was it 2017 or something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to MJ BizCon for like so many
years in a row they all just kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we linked up recently while you
were in Vegas you were doing a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of episodes of your show which we'll talk
about and yeah man it's good to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: sit down and do this talk with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll learn a little bit more about your
garden and then we're gonna go over some
[SPEAKER_01]: additional questions that we have for you
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you ready to get going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'm ready to get going and what the
what the viewers and listeners should know
[SPEAKER_00]: is that Chris and I had an amazing Chinese
dinner in Las Vegas when we were there and
[SPEAKER_00]: we had like three lobsters and a table
full of plates and it was it was awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those that don't know who you are
can you just tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and kind of how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so you know a little bit about myself
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the co-CEO of you know a group of
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The largest one being Growers House which
is an equipment supplier built to hobbyist
[SPEAKER_00]: and commercial growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like 16,000 products you know
everything you'd carry from like
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation to lighting to rolling benches,
hydroponic systems, nutrient stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we also do have some YouTube
channels in a forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have Growers Network and then you
know the YouTube channel that we'll chat
[SPEAKER_00]: about a little bit later which people can
check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's see other than that you know how
I got started I guess is just being one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those curious kids in college who starts
growing and next thing you know you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like which way should I go in my life?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know and I was like maybe I'll you
know go into something related to finance
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that but turns out my
internship told me that that was not the
[SPEAKER_00]: right choice and I decided to go to down
this path and I've been doing it for man
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like 13-14 years at this point been
in the hydro and like growing industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crazy yeah I'm looking at your YouTube
channel the Growers House YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and I'll link this down in the
YouTube description section below so you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys can go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you sort by oldest to newest you've
got videos from like eight years ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: you see got a different hairstyle back
then huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I had different everything style back
then especially shooting style.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah we have those two channels that
probably will be in the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah don't look at the ones from eight
years ago definitely look at the ones like
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last year that's probably better
those ones are antiquated you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah but your it looks like your channel
is mostly about like equipment different
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment that you have you know I assume
you sell this all at Growers House and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know you talked to me said you want to
talk about like testing which we'll get to
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the end of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about the garden so you have
a garden right I don't know if you grow do
[SPEAKER_01]: you grow indoors or outdoors and what type
of plants do you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so right now people do ask me that
question a lot they're like so what what
[SPEAKER_00]: are you doing you're growing like a
humongous outdoor plot or a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 50,000 square foot indoor and I'm
like well you know not really I kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little setup at home both a kind of
what I would consider a really small
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse almost like a hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where main like mainly like the the
veggies grow that we play around me and my
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend and then we do have the indoor
grow tent where I do a little like R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: research and development on like new
products coming out you know we do resell
[SPEAKER_00]: other products but we do we have a lot of
our own product lines you know we have our
[SPEAKER_00]: own grow tents you know our own carbon
filters fans we've had our own line of
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs so when those products come in I like
to test them out and see if they they work
[SPEAKER_00]: well and if they do awesome if they don't
we make some tweaks or sometimes we find
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a new partner to partner with but
that four by four for medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that's inside is you know it's relatively
basic growth type and lately you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: tell people man my day job is like it
takes a lot of time like I'm usually
[SPEAKER_00]: working six or seven days a week on the
business the equipment side so we're
[SPEAKER_00]: helping other people grow and when you do
that you realize you barely have any time
[SPEAKER_00]: for yourself to grow sometimes so what we
try and do is you know maybe we'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: with the veggie garden and we can move to
the medicinal garden but on the veggie
[SPEAKER_00]: garden it's like you know four foot by
eight foot kind of hoop house thing
[SPEAKER_00]: growing like some days you just wake up on
a Saturday and you're like you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go get some plants you hit up
the nursery in the morning grab a coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: on your way out like that is like those
mornings that I dream about then you just
[SPEAKER_00]: go pick some things so most recently we
got some broccoli some cauliflower you
[SPEAKER_00]: know my girlfriend was all about getting
the nerve garden kind of the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: thing so like oregano rosemary thyme
things of that sort parsley and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: tried some funkier things you know we
tried some yams out there too and we did
[SPEAKER_00]: try some melons which it's funny I think
we got these seeds and we thought there
[SPEAKER_00]: are melons and they turned out to not be
melons so you know that's always fun
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise too but in Arizona it's tough
like you basically grow October through
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe May then in the summer you just shut
the outdoor one down gets way too hot in
[SPEAKER_00]: Tucson it'll be a hundred you can get up
to a hundred and ten and then in that
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse would be like a hundred and
fifty probably you know it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: everything would bake but when you go into
the medicinal garden you know like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: working six or seven days a week I really
want to set it up to just be fully
[SPEAKER_00]: automated in a way so I like what I like
to say is you know I want someone out
[SPEAKER_00]: there to write a book please viewers write
this book I would read it if someone had
[SPEAKER_00]: it but you know how to grow medicinal
plants for the busy person and I will give
[SPEAKER_00]: you the outline of how to do it so let's
see get a four by four ten step one step
[SPEAKER_00]: two I got an autopot foresight system so
some of you guys have probably heard about
[SPEAKER_00]: that the good thing about it is you don't
have to plug it into anything it's totally
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity-fed waters the plants as they need
water so with four plants in a four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four you know on the medicinal side you
could yield you know with a good like
[SPEAKER_00]: probably end up yielding you know about a
pound and you know what I would say is I
[SPEAKER_00]: could fill up that reservoir and about two
weeks later I can come back and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: not have opened the tent for two weeks I
just filled the reservoir with nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 12 gallons ish so it
depends on how big your plants are how
[SPEAKER_00]: fast they're feeding but then you just
have a few timers you know for your lights
[SPEAKER_00]: to go on and off at the right times for
your ventilation to go on and off at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right times and it's a super set it and
forget it system I loved it and like in
[SPEAKER_00]: those buckets you can choose what media
you go with and what I'd probably
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend most is filling the these these
autopot buckets in there about four
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons each and they gravity kind of feed
and then they will wick up through the
[SPEAKER_00]: media and I'd fill it probably the first
inch or two with hydroton so clay pebbles
[SPEAKER_00]: and then on top of that you can kind of
add whatever media you want so I go with
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa straight cocoa and you know you can
use a lot of different cocos ones I would
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend is like you know candy cocoa is
great even mother earth cocoa is great you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go mother earth straight cocoa with
perlite you know some people even going to
[SPEAKER_00]: soil this mix is like a pro mix that would
also work really well but the cool thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is you can even put like a like a nutrient
dense soil above those clay pebbles and it
[SPEAKER_00]: works really well in that system and then
you can like rely a little bit less on
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients if you want because you know
with the cocoa you definitely want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure the plants have that full nutrition
in that reservoir but you could do like an
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean forest inside of that or a vermin
fire which are two soils that come packed
[SPEAKER_00]: with enough nutrients that like three or
four weeks in you know you can be totally
[SPEAKER_00]: fine and then add some light nutrients
thereafter so pretty good system I like it
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit that's kind of my R&D system
because usually I'm testing out like
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting is very common and then different
forms of environmental control but I leave
[SPEAKER_00]: the hydroponic system relatively the same
let's talk a little bit more about auto
[SPEAKER_01]: watering so I have the auto pot system too
yeah I had like the six pot or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think I used like four and then two
of the plants ended up being male so I
[SPEAKER_01]: went down to two yeah but it's so easy to
use like you said is gravity-fed I was
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I did perlite on the bottom two
inches then I use Foxarm ocean forest soil
[SPEAKER_01]: like you had suggested you talked about
and then I was actually top dressing with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic nutrients and then my reservoir
was only plain water so many things pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: simple now this last run I did have a
little bit of issues because that top
[SPEAKER_01]: layer does kind of dry out a little bit
and when you're using organic nutrients in
[SPEAKER_01]: your top dressing that top layer should be
moist so I need to figure out a way around
[SPEAKER_01]: that whether it be a thicker mulch layer
on top of it or what but yeah I mean using
[SPEAKER_01]: that auto watering system was definitely
made things a lot easier so you're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients within that reservoir right what
brand of nutrients are you using and are
[SPEAKER_01]: you using any sort of like like pump or
air stones or anything to like mix it up
[SPEAKER_01]: so the nutrients stay in solution they
don't just settle at the bottom or what
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah yeah so let me actually right before
we jump into that I'm gonna give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple suggestions on your side so when
you order autopods you get this what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've probably seen it's almost like a
mesh piece of fabric that you put on the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom that keeps particulates from
getting into and clogging some of the so
[SPEAKER_00]: that some of the drains the copper disc
yeah yeah exactly and you know you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually use things like think of it this
way water can permeate basically any type
[SPEAKER_00]: of fabric right you can make another layer
of that and what I would do is put the
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite if you want to you can add another
layer of like even think of it like this
[SPEAKER_00]: way like a cheesecloth right and then you
put maybe an inch or two of your ocean
[SPEAKER_00]: forest on dress some of the nutrients in
your top dressing which you'd actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: a bottom dressing added layer of soil
dress a little bit more and that way as it
[SPEAKER_00]: wicks up it'll pull the nutrients up with
it so it's not missing them because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not wicking at the top so that's one thing
you could do in the future that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful for that organic style because
that's that's really cool too if people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go organic but also have a hydro
system that's a good way to do it like you
[SPEAKER_01]: were just talking about yeah so yeah I
tried to I tried to do it that way so sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of create a super soil to where it would
be more dense in nutrients so I added more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients on top of the Fox farm and then
in more nutrients in to try to get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: last the entire grow now those autopod
systems I'm not sure if they're different
[SPEAKER_01]: pot sizes but they're about four liters I
believe is the pot so just under four
[SPEAKER_01]: liter pot size and it just the I guess
maybe I grew vegetable plants for too long
[SPEAKER_01]: or what but within flower I started seeing
those deficiencies and that's why I know I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have that super so I didn't have
enough nutrients in there so maybe I just
[SPEAKER_01]: need to go heavier on the nutrients in the
future I think that that would be a good
[SPEAKER_00]: idea yeah yeah potentially you know that
could be a way to do it but I do think
[SPEAKER_00]: they're four four gallons not four liters
there's a heads up oh yeah yeah sorry four
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons yes they're like an XL one which I
forgot I think it's like six gallons or
[SPEAKER_00]: something but it's a little bit bigger I
haven't I haven't used those I just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of go with the standard auto pots but
they're modular so it's like look you have
[SPEAKER_00]: one plant that's just absolutely crushing
it then you have another male just take
[SPEAKER_00]: out the other pot super easy you know but
going into oh yeah so like I guess in the
[SPEAKER_00]: latest R&D run that I was doing nutrient
wise I was running this new nutrient line
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're actually participating in
bringing to market which is called Ventana
[SPEAKER_00]: plant science and you know it's been about
two years in development and you know most
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients I will say they're they're based
on a lot of the same kind of macro and
[SPEAKER_00]: micro nutrients that plants need so macros
you know being your NPK and then micros
[SPEAKER_00]: being a lot of those kind of smaller
elements that people don't hear about as
[SPEAKER_00]: much you know your boron your zinc things
like that but the interesting thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: this one is there's a kind of like this
proprietary amino acid polymer that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been playing around with that this
formulation chemist built which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty awesome because it was like
supposed to be like it should and could be
[SPEAKER_00]: patented but as soon as you patent kind of
like a formula for a nutrient basically or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that you you release more
information about how it's made and like
[SPEAKER_00]: that is something so that's why we call
basically a proprietary instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: patented so you want to keep some of the
secret sauce you know like kind of so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can keep the secret sauce the secret
sauce but the cool thing is we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: you know selling it under the Ventana
plant science name and the the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is this polymer this amino acid
polymer it's actually made from the shells
[SPEAKER_00]: of mollusks so like sea creatures yeah the
shells of mollusks have this very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting amino acid and then they
polymerized it meaning that they made it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that's just hyper absorbable for
plants and it's also breaks down other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to be more more absorbable by
the plant so George the formulation
[SPEAKER_00]: chemist this guy's been we met him and
he's the one who developed this and we
[SPEAKER_00]: were like man this is the smartest person
on plant nutrients we've ever met and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's you know me and one of our other
people on our staff Renee who's been you
[SPEAKER_00]: know she was the director of sales
director for Botanic Air for like a decade
[SPEAKER_00]: and so she knows her nutrients really well
and you know I love talking with her about
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and she's she's written like a
lot of the labels you know for the
[SPEAKER_00]: old-school labels that people have seen
for Botanic Air but man George is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those guys that like you just want to like
crack open a beer and sit and just listen
[SPEAKER_00]: to him talk for like an hour you know and
he's just such a nice guy but you know he
[SPEAKER_00]: developed it they've been trying out a
commercial garden there were well a few of
[SPEAKER_00]: them for the last two years and with
having some pretty good results so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying it here and the plants grew
amazingly and yeah that's the last R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing that we were doing but it's
kind of like a pretty standard nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: line when it comes to the amount of
bottles you know it's not advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients with 18 I think it's like a six
bottle kind of formula and then yeah the
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary amino acids in a product
called Flava it's like FLAVUH yep so the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way I can compare it almost is like
if you had like what are people familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with almost like a turpinator meets bud
candy in a way so that's that's some
[SPEAKER_01]: effects you can see something like that
those six bottles are that those aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: all base nutrients or is it base nutrients
plus their additives exactly yep base
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients plus the additives so there's
well there's a kind of more of like a home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardener line and there's a commercial
line but you know I was they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing it's just the commercial
lines more in like a it's like a soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: powder because that's how most commercial
gardens use their nutrients while easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: transport store can be a little bit
cheaper when you're buying in bulk like a
[SPEAKER_00]: pallet of nutrients but it's basically a
grow and a bloom and then there's a Cal
[SPEAKER_00]: Mag and there's a silica and then there's
the Flava and then there's PK and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the whole line yeah all powdered
so no that the at-home one is all liquids
[SPEAKER_00]: okay and then the commercial line is all
powder except for the Flava product
[SPEAKER_00]: because that one has to be in a solution
for it to that proprietary amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: polymer to like work properly so that's
the only liquid yeah okay and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: said these are gonna be released soon I
assume that the way folks can find out
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're released is probably to sign
up to your email list is that right the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers house email list as soon as you
guys will make some sort of announcement
[SPEAKER_01]: or something yes let those folks know that
it's available yeah maybe we should like
[SPEAKER_00]: help her you know hire you for our
marketing department or something a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: times we're like it's it's funny we
operate this way but when it comes down to
[SPEAKER_00]: it like we're growers and we're not like
like I just say we're a company of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: but that that comes with its pluses and
minuses what that means is we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced at launching product lines so
we just like like to R&D the products as
[SPEAKER_00]: much as possible make sure that we're
making something that like we love it's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing like as good as it possibly can and
we stand behind and we'd recommend to our
[SPEAKER_00]: friends and then we have to figure out how
to get the message out there so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the part we're probably not as good
at we're probably good at growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants the marketing side yeah we could
probably use some help so any marketers
[SPEAKER_00]: out there want to work with us that'd be
great but yeah fill out the email list
[SPEAKER_01]: that's funny yeah I'm not good at
marketing either so many people comment on
[SPEAKER_01]: my videos like you should be promoting
your book more and blah blah blah and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just like I never like think about that
stuff like I'm thinking about the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: and like showing off the plants and
talking about the plants yeah I could use
[SPEAKER_01]: a marketer too so anybody in marketing hit
me up yeah we can we can we can share them
[SPEAKER_01]: you can work for both of us to be fun time
that would be awesome awesome but getting
[SPEAKER_01]: back into the grow let's talk about water
source so are using RO water tap water
[SPEAKER_00]: rainwater what are you doing for water
yeah our water for sure like I told you
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I grow when I'm doing R&D I will
say like I do love you know fully organics
[SPEAKER_00]: like sometimes you feel like like my
garden outside with all the veggies
[SPEAKER_00]: totally organic right hundred percent and
sometimes you're like yeah I really want
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden to just be all full of these
meals and you know manures and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that you feel like is just
coming out of the earth and putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: back into it you know we have a compost
bin so I compost and when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: R &D side though on the medicinal plants
in the grow 10 I like to have it a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more dialed in in a way where I'm I'm the
scientist controlling all the lepers right
[SPEAKER_00]: so when I was talking about the clay
pebbles and just straight cocoa core
[SPEAKER_00]: totally inert right add the nutrients in
and that's the way that you know basically
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to operate and I want my water for
those nutrients to be basically as close
[SPEAKER_00]: to zero parts per million as possible so
through an RO system if as long as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: working properly you're gonna be between
like zero and thirty parts per million if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like north of you know you can see
your membrane starting to go out when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're like kind of north of 50 but it's
not too bad even up to a hundred it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: what your water still great once you get
over a hundred it's probably make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you're checking your filters and
everything like that I actually had a
[SPEAKER_01]: filter go out on me and I didn't realize
it and I was growing with it and my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: started look like hot trash and then I
checked the PPM on my RO and it was like
[SPEAKER_01]: higher than tap and I was like okay well
there we go I think I had to change out
[SPEAKER_01]: the membrane or something like that so
that's a huge tip right there is make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're checking the PPMs on your RO water
because you could a filter could just go
[SPEAKER_01]: and the membrane could go and it could
just be injecting tap water in there yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know I mean I don't depending on
how you do it like sometimes I put like a
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like those like 20 or 30 dollar
Rubbermaids you can put like in a garage
[SPEAKER_00]: or something where you can have our RO
filtering into it with a flow valve so it
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically shuts off when it fills and
then if you have like 30 or 40 gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water I mean I guess depending how large
your growers but if you're just doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: home grow that'll last you a while so if
you just test that out once every few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks you know you should be good but I
notice people who like fill up their
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir consistently with an RO system
you are you know I guess you'd be more
[SPEAKER_00]: prone to having issues because you'd have
to be testing basically every time RO is
[SPEAKER_00]: putting water in your reservoir or in your
plants which could be every day for some
[SPEAKER_01]: people depending on how their system set
up that makes sense now for the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you mentioned you're in cocoa and
our medium you're adding the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: correct me if I'm wrong but this isn't a
synthetic line that you're that you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's a salt based and that are you
following a feeding chart and this feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: chart that you guys have is it for
medicinal plants is it gonna be a full
[SPEAKER_01]: dose is accurate for medicinal plants or
should it be like every other nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: line almost every other nutrient line
where it's typically recommended to start
[SPEAKER_00]: with a half dose and see how your plants
are yeah and you know it's so there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: feed chart both in milliliters per gallon
and PPM for it so both those are available
[SPEAKER_00]: on you know the URL for the sites actually
Ventana plant dot science so it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: Ventana plant science calm but if you go
there you will see the two different feed
[SPEAKER_00]: charts but you know the funny thing is
with with nutrient lines yeah almost all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them kind of overstate yeah basically
the concentration of nutrients you should
[SPEAKER_00]: give to your plants and I do always really
recommend going at half strength and even
[SPEAKER_00]: for this one I would start going at half
strength and then work your way up because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much better for a plant to have
slightly less nutrients and work your way
[SPEAKER_00]: up then to basically force your plant to a
nutrient lockout through that osmotic
[SPEAKER_00]: process and then have to reel it back in
so that's honestly one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people recommend that and people
they usually have a better experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients when they go that way and the
interesting thing is you know some plants
[SPEAKER_00]: will do they will look a hundred percent
healthy under half strength and even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you start pushing it to three-quarter
strength and even up almost to full
[SPEAKER_00]: strength some plants you won't even notice
that difference and they're just there
[SPEAKER_00]: they're you know they're they're really
adaptable to nutrient concentrations you
[SPEAKER_00]: know some strains some plants and
cultivars but some are not then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to find the sweet spot so I wish there was
like a general kind of rule or guideline I
[SPEAKER_00]: could give to people where I'd say you
know here it is just do this close your
[SPEAKER_00]: eyes walk away and everything will be fine
but it's just not that easy you know so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think people if you think of it this way
psychologically if you have by the way
[SPEAKER_00]: just going back to that last point if you
are feeding half and your plant is looking
[SPEAKER_00]: great and then you go up to whole you know
a hundred percent and it's also still
[SPEAKER_00]: looking great you probably just want to go
back to half anyways because at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just kind of wasting nutrients like
money you know and your plants probably
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do just fine it'll adapt to what it
needs but psychologically if there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient line who said you should feed you
know five milliliters a gallon and then
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant is looking yellow at five mills
a gallon in some ways that show a
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency and then you increase it to ten
mills a gallon you know sometimes people
[SPEAKER_00]: are psychologically are like wow you know
I'm like I'm feeding this plant so much
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so far above it's almost like taking
medicine like do you want to take double
[SPEAKER_00]: the dose of a medicine do you think that's
healthy or safe so psychologically it's
[SPEAKER_00]: better to tell people the limits over here
than rather to underestimate the limit and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully depending on the cultivars
you're growing you know someone is
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere between that 75 to 100 percent
range of what you give them and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: psychologically that's a little bit better
for people to absorb if you have to throw
[SPEAKER_01]: something out there that makes sense yeah
now with these lines another thing you had
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned that it could be you know
overfeeding or toxicity issue or plant
[SPEAKER_01]: problems in general maybe yellowing or
whatever do you monitor the pH you know
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM is another thing or EC there's another
thing that that people look at do you
[SPEAKER_01]: personally do that do you recommend that
for this nutrient line or some there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some nutrient lines that have the pH
perfect advanced as a pH perfect so you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to worry about pHing your
nutrient mix prior to giving your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: so yeah talk to us a little bit about that
yeah definitely and normally I would if
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about nutrients in general I
do recommend phing but of course mix your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients first you know wait five or ten
minutes stir it up test your nutrients out
[SPEAKER_00]: for advanced nutrients pH perfect you know
that is an interesting product and it does
[SPEAKER_00]: work pretty well this this nutrient line
as developed if you add it to clean RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water and you add all the nutrients during
every phase like it should actually be in
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct pH so you won't have to pH it
so that is that is pretty cool it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically how the nutrient was designed
basically with George's this comes back to
[SPEAKER_00]: George's genius of like basically what
type of chemicals structure am I gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have in each bottle and how is that gonna
make it so that it makes it as easy as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible so this is I guess you could call
it I don't know I don't want to use that
[SPEAKER_00]: terminology my trademarked by advanced
nutrients but it is a pH balanced nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: so you don't have to jump in there and the
interesting thing is the way it's designed
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH will fluctuate a little bit but as
it basically goes to the planet makes sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the pH in the environment is proper
for the nutrients to be absorbed which is
[SPEAKER_00]: the most important part so does that mean
that your solution always has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly at 6.2 pH no you know it can vary
a little bit but people don't have to jump
[SPEAKER_00]: in there unless they're you know RO water
they're starting with is that like a 4 or
[SPEAKER_00]: a 10 or something you know something
absolutely ridiculous so yeah that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it relatively simple to do but when it
comes to pH in your water with other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients if they're not advertising that
you know their product has some type of pH
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing technology then I definitely
would recommend doing that and when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to EC PPM TDS you know that's like
saying miles per hour kilometers per hour
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's it's like there's different
ways of measuring the same thing the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of nutrients in the solution
I do recommend I think especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing the same cultivar over and
over paying attention to your to your EC
[SPEAKER_00]: or parts from million and seeing how the
plant responds like having your own grow
[SPEAKER_00]: journal is like the best way to do that I
would say you know starting off with your
[SPEAKER_00]: the guideline we were speaking about of
just being like 50% of what the feed chart
[SPEAKER_00]: recommends and working your way up that's
probably the best way to initiate it but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know a lot of times I know people
growing amazing medicinal plants at end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower it's like 900 parts per million and
then I know people growing amazing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and that the end they're doing 1600 parts
per million and if you flip-flop those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient recipes like you're probably not
gonna have the same amazing plants those
[SPEAKER_00]: people were growing so it's it's really
about a positive feedback loop and in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way at almost it's funny because it's like
people should treat themselves the way
[SPEAKER_00]: they treat their plants and vice versa and
what I mean by that is journal for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants journal for yourself you know if
you had a funky day write about it and try
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand the association between
like you know what when I hang out with
[SPEAKER_00]: these people I always seem to have a
really good day and I can look back on
[SPEAKER_00]: that and make those associations and then
you start hanging out with those people
[SPEAKER_00]: again more and more and it's no different
with your plant it's like what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool things were going on its environment
when it looked its best now how do I
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate that again and believe me if you
just try and rely on your mind and be like
[SPEAKER_00]: oh yeah I'll remember it dude it's all
good I got this you're gonna realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've forgot and then you're gonna like
be chasing your tail so for me it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: even the smartest people I know are
writing down notes and referring back to
[SPEAKER_00]: them because then you don't have to be
keeping like this encyclopedic knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: in your head about what happened every day
like look what happened in your garden in
[SPEAKER_00]: January 23rd you know do you remember no
no yeah I don't remember like the older I
[SPEAKER_00]: get the more I realize the value of
writing things down and journaling things
[SPEAKER_00]: and whether that goes to your plants or
yourself so please I completely agree yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: I have what I use is Google sheets and the
reason why I use it is because I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: roommate who also helps in the garden as
well yes being able to share that sheet be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to refer to it both added notes is
key and it's basically just pretty simple
[SPEAKER_01]: you know on the rows you've got the date
and then on the columns you've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and then you know within each cell
you're writing down for that day like what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing whether it be you know you're
transplanted on this day or you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: fed in and this was the runoff pH or
runoff PPM or pH even pH going in pH going
[SPEAKER_01]: out so just all those details it's good to
look back on especially if you do pop into
[SPEAKER_01]: a problem you can look back at those notes
and say okay maybe this is happening
[SPEAKER_01]: because a week ago or two weeks ago I did
this so I totally agree with you on you
[SPEAKER_01]: know using some sort of journal diary
whatever you want to call it to track your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants because you're you're not gonna be
able to remember it especially for me I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow like typically like six to twelve
plants at a time there's no way I can
[SPEAKER_01]: remember all that all different cultivars
they all have different nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements so it's super tough what do
you use to track to use any sort of app or
[SPEAKER_00]: really funny piece of paper or what yeah
no I'm a definitely a child of the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet so I'm extremely digital and you
know most of my notes either go into
[SPEAKER_00]: Google Drive shared spreadsheet or
Evernote those are my two go-to's so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: probably very very similar to you and it's
good doing it with someone too because
[SPEAKER_00]: they they can kind of keep you accountable
in a way you know they can prod you if you
[SPEAKER_00]: missed a day or two and also like don't
sweat it like some people are super
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectionist and they'll be like oh I'm
gonna start journaling you know every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day of my growing operation and
it's it's gonna be perfect you know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna write like a paragraph each day and
then I'm also gonna do a hundred push-ups
[SPEAKER_00]: and run three miles you know dude like
relax it's okay you just put like a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of small notes that takes you five seconds
don't set yourself up to fail and like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you miss a few days oh man I went out my
friends a wicked hangover and I missed a
[SPEAKER_00]: day or something like look it's okay you
don't need perfection just like if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get it the majority of the time you're
doing yourself like exponentially better
[SPEAKER_00]: than not doing it at all so it's almost
like that one push-up rule kind of thing
[SPEAKER_00]: like I have to use it all the time I think
I have to refer back to it like every
[SPEAKER_00]: other week but it's like look every
morning just do one push-up if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do a second one you don't have to
but oftentimes what happens is you like
[SPEAKER_00]: end up doing like 10 or 20 push-ups
because you're like you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: already down here already doing the
push-up why should I get back up but some
[SPEAKER_00]: days you just do one push-up you know and
that's just kind of the way it is plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are like life you know they teach you a
lot that's a really great point for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah let's uh let's switch it up let's
talk about environment a little bit so
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature humidity you know what do you
typically aim for on those avenues yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: you know it's so funny also because in in
many ways people are like man your your
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown must be so dialed in and perfect
you know you you helped build out these
[SPEAKER_00]: like basically multi-million dollar
operations with their equipment and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and I'm like well you know
because I'm doing that sometimes I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: pay as much attention to the one at home
as I should and I will be the first person
[SPEAKER_00]: to admit that but a lot of times like I
don't like it's basically in a room and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever that room is is what the grow
tent is so the thing is in the winter you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's probably closer to about a 75
and being in Arizona humidity is
[SPEAKER_00]: nationally pretty low so I do have to find
cultivars that can deal with that usually
[SPEAKER_00]: I am keeping like in flower I do try and
keep it around like 50% in veg and then
[SPEAKER_00]: around 40% in flower which is a little bit
lower than probably the average person but
[SPEAKER_00]: look I'm in Arizona right but when it
comes to temperature around 75 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter it probably gets to 80 maybe I
might even creep up to 85 in the summer
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on that room it's just the
natural house is getting a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: warmer but you know especially in the
summer I'm always adding co2 and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are like oh what kind of crazy co2
operation you got going in there and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like dude it's a four by four tent just
get an exhale bag or two hang it up you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be fine you know and so that's what I do
for that little guy that's why I was gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: ask if you supplemented co2 so use the
bags have you had good success with those
[SPEAKER_01]: do you hang them above the plants or what
do you do with those definitely hang them
[SPEAKER_00]: above the plants because co2 will fall you
know so naturally you do want to hang them
[SPEAKER_00]: out up there you know we did do some
testing I'm a very big tester I love
[SPEAKER_00]: testing products like I don't trust most
things that are given to me until I can
[SPEAKER_00]: corroborate the evidence myself especially
if it's something that's gonna be like for
[SPEAKER_00]: example product we're gonna bring to
market right it's like you know you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure you rigorously test the
product to make sure that it's good and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got into that even before you know we were
coming out their own products I was
[SPEAKER_00]: testing a lot of LEDs these days I'm
sending them to light laboratories and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing full panel on like other brands of
LEDs cost a thousand dollars per test we
[SPEAKER_00]: do that we have a blog on our website
where we test a lot of that stuff but I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to find like you know here's the
marketed efficiency of the LED and then
[SPEAKER_00]: most often here is where the actual
testing comes into the efficiency of LED
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of you moles per joule so that
efficiency rating that a lot of people see
[SPEAKER_00]: so a lot of LED companies out there I will
I'm not gonna name any names but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: say there are a lot of companies
especially on Amazon who say they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: 2.7 2.8 you moles per joule and they
actually test it like 2.2 which if you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about it that's like a 30% you know
decrease from what they're advertising
[SPEAKER_00]: like imagine if like you know vitamin C
advertised to you like or a pill like
[SPEAKER_00]: ibuprofen they're like oh yeah it's 200
milligrams and then you test it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's actually more like 140 like
that's not false advertising yeah I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: it is false advertising but when you're in
such a niche little industry it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: who's the police you know of the small
industry I think they're policing more
[SPEAKER_00]: like Google and Apple and Facebook and
things like that so let's get into that
[SPEAKER_01]: light testing a little bit more that is
something that I had on the list here that
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to talk about so you've done some
light testing in the past I definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: want to dive deeper into that you know
integrated sphere is a test that's very
[SPEAKER_01]: common I'm sure you use that or you've had
you've used that in the past or have at
[SPEAKER_01]: least had your third party testing or
whatever yeah can you talk about like
[SPEAKER_01]: testing in a hole and kind of what your
goal there and so on and so forth yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: with integrated spheres they're extremely
expensive if you want to look one up and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy one more power to you that means you
definitely got some you know some play
[SPEAKER_00]: around money but we do contract that out
we actually do use you know it sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: funny because it's like light laboratory
that's actually the name of the company so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just a laboratory that test
lights but they're out of California Jason
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason Gee I think it is or G I don't know
the best way to pronounce it he's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the main guys over there but he's tested a
lot of lights for us and so we do a full
[SPEAKER_00]: panel like we'll do a grid over like a 5x5
at 12 you know 18 24 36 inches they do
[SPEAKER_00]: full testing looking at basically PPF and
PPFD you moles per joule they do it
[SPEAKER_00]: between 400 and 700 nanometers and for
those of you don't know that's just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like the photosynthetic range they also
test it from like I think 380 to 720 so a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a wider range and give you
also the PPF and PPFD for that they do a
[SPEAKER_00]: full spectral chart so they show you that
awesome little funky wave and you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: like how many blues are coming out
relative intensity versus the reds and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some whites and oranges yellows
things in between they also do a you know
[SPEAKER_00]: chromaticity graph which is a little bit
maybe a little bit above the average kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of late person to kind of absorb but they
do do that and you know a lot of people I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually for customers of ours especially
on the commercial side when they're like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I'm thinking about this LED or
that LED and I'm gonna be investing two to
[SPEAKER_00]: three hundred thousand dollars which way
should I go I want to be able to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligently about what you know what way
I think they should go in and based off of
[SPEAKER_00]: data not just necessarily what a sales rep
from the company told you who happens to
[SPEAKER_00]: be you know a really good friend or a
great you know maybe salesperson so I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: rather have the data kind of do the
talking for the product but sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: data is not available so in a way I felt
like an obligation to start creating that
[SPEAKER_00]: data making it publicly available and
that's where the light testing kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: came from and believe me I've tried to
test other products like I tried to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan test with like inline fans because
people would call us and like everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a fan would be like hey so what's
the quietest six inch fan that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd always be like man I don't know
like this one's quiet when you put ducting
[SPEAKER_00]: on it and a carbon filter but maybe as
quiet as the other one so I bought this
[SPEAKER_00]: like decibel meter and I was like you know
what we're just gonna test it so we went
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the office bought like every fan in
the market started testing with this
[SPEAKER_00]: decibel meter I think this is one of those
really old videos like a six or seven year
[SPEAKER_00]: old video on growers house probably still
up there I got it taken down probably but
[SPEAKER_00]: we were testing it and I will say like we
got some measurements out of that decibel
[SPEAKER_00]: meter but the thing was also like all over
the place so like that test in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be like one of the first people to
say like we got some decibel readings for
[SPEAKER_00]: those fans but like when I was in that
room listening to them they were all loud
[SPEAKER_00]: like like could I perceptively know the
difference no so you're like kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: splitting hairs in a way so like some of
my testing goes really well and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like you know I guess you can't feel
fast feel forward I guess it's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophy now for the light testing you
said this information is publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: available where would folks go to access
this information yeah how many roughly how
[SPEAKER_01]: many lights does this consist of all the
tests so yeah the I mean how many like
[SPEAKER_00]: lights have I tested in my career we're
probably somewhere between 50 and 100 on
[SPEAKER_00]: the most recent and relevant blog post
that we have up that uses the the light
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory that I really like using
there's probably 10 ish up there including
[SPEAKER_00]: like Gavita Fluence HLG growers choice
California Lightworks and I might be
[SPEAKER_00]: missing one or two but I know coming up we
are gonna be testing a few more brands and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them up there I know that on deck
we have like Lux Illuminar you know some
[SPEAKER_00]: people we do take some recommendations
from people so some people have thrown out
[SPEAKER_00]: LED companies such as the think grow by
troll master science you know and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: if there's any other LED companies that
are really making making waves in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry then they're probably worth
testing but if you go to growers house dot
[SPEAKER_00]: com slash blog that'll take you to our
blog and we have a lot of tests there but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's one blog in particular I think if
you just Google like best LED grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: of 2021 in Google we're like the first or
second thing that comes up and just look
[SPEAKER_00]: for the one that's by growers house and
that's kind of the LED test and yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: awesome yeah I think that's great
information for the folks to have you know
[SPEAKER_01]: especially you know as you know I deal
with a lot of a lot of home growers are
[SPEAKER_01]: really my audience is what I like to think
you know not as many in the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things I feel like more indoors
versus outdoors because that's the way I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow so I feel like a lot of folks a
majority of them maybe not everybody are
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of similar to that so indoor lighting
is huge it can be expensive and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a lack of data and
misinformation like you mentioned with
[SPEAKER_01]: people reporting false numbers and stuff
like that so you doing these tests having
[SPEAKER_01]: this information publicly available is
huge so thank you for doing that for us
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll link grows house blog down in the
description section if I could find that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific specific article I'll link that
in the description section so you guys can
[SPEAKER_01]: get right to it so you can see that
information right away but yeah great
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff there good stuff with the lighting
for sure yeah and you know we so even
[SPEAKER_00]: though I'm doing the R&D at home I do have
R&D with some friends at licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities and I'm actually
also part owner of one of Massachusetts so
[SPEAKER_00]: we are doing some testing with LEDs over
there different types of automated
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation like so people are wondering
like oh do you just have that little R&D
[SPEAKER_00]: 4x4 like no we test it depends on the
product line right so we have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of hobbyist product line stuff like plant
house tents that's like one of our tents
[SPEAKER_00]: so I tested that and that's the tent I'm
growing in but that's obviously not
[SPEAKER_00]: relevant for the commercial grower right
so yeah make sense so kind of getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: the commercial side of things you've you
know you have your own show can of cribs
[SPEAKER_01]: yep and you tore dozens and dozens of
facilities over the years you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing that for what are you on your
third second season third season yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: we're like finishing up our second season
and finishing up the second season yeah so
[SPEAKER_00]: finishing up the second season and then
we're just gonna keep going we have some
[SPEAKER_00]: fun stuff coming out actually we have a
yeah we have I'll just say this summer
[SPEAKER_00]: there's gonna be a really funny video that
drops that is very unlike what we normally
[SPEAKER_00]: do so check it out yeah definitely
subscribe to growers network if you are
[SPEAKER_01]: not currently so a question I want to ask
you is in regards to cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities and kind of having the the home
grow in mind right like I mentioned a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of my audience is probably home growers is
there anything you've seen in these
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facilities that you think can
be applied to the home grower that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't see the home grower
traditionally doing you know that I would
[SPEAKER_00]: say immediately the answer is absolutely
yes there there are a lot of differences
[SPEAKER_00]: between commercial and home kind of
growing operations but even in our last
[SPEAKER_00]: episode we filmed at at shango in Las
Vegas that that was just released and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this one section where we talk
about propagation and like you know in
[SPEAKER_00]: that propagation section you know what let
me let me rewind for a quick second when
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to a flowering room of a commercial
cultivation facility it's like it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so impressive and large and expansive and
the environment is controlled by these
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know 800 pound D Hughes that hang
from the ceiling and there's 10 of them
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's 200 lights and they have this
prevar Argus you know environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: controller and that also cost a hundred
thousand dollars as nets worked into their
[SPEAKER_00]: system and they're monitoring by computers
that's not like your hunger right but when
[SPEAKER_00]: you go into like the propagation section
even it's like you know they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: little 18 watt clone lights on a little
rack with 10 by 20 you know cloning trays
[SPEAKER_00]: with little grow Dan cubes and clone X you
know and I said that in the episode I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like this is the same exact way that
you're probably gonna be cloning at home
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is exactly what they're doing at
the commercial facility but instead of one
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning dome you know with a few plants in
it they just end up having about 40 of
[SPEAKER_00]: them you know with 50 clones each and they
do that consistently every week but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's almost it's almost like comical
that you know cloning and propagation is
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly the way it is at home as it is in
these commercial facilities so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: watch like any of those kind of groups
videos like in the propagation you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: watch it and you'll be like oh yeah like
this is basically what I do at home oh but
[SPEAKER_00]: oh they taught me that little you know
maybe that that little thing about like
[SPEAKER_00]: you know kind of like shaving the outer
layer of the plant or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: these cool little tips but you know what
if we go deeper though some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial operations are trying to keep
the genetics of their plant you know as as
[SPEAKER_00]: pure as possible so they're getting into
like tissue culture which is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that not a lot of people do at home but
you know when it comes down to it I think
[SPEAKER_00]: in commercial operations they're really
monitoring the exact same environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: factors they just have to do it on a
bigger scale so they're checking their pH
[SPEAKER_00]: they're checking their ppm they're
checking their temps their humidity you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the considerations when you go up to
a really large operation are not a change
[SPEAKER_00]: in those levers it's just a change in what
technology is needed for you to monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: those levers at that scale and learning
that so I wouldn't put commercial growing
[SPEAKER_00]: on a pedestal from basic kind of growing
understanding and expertise but I will say
[SPEAKER_00]: I do put it on a pedestal when it comes to
how you get the proper technology to all
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate together and almost becoming a
general contractor of a commercial garden
[SPEAKER_00]: like that's the people that I see do
really well they really study the manuals
[SPEAKER_00]: on this technology and they they really
read through that and they try and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand everything about the growing
operation and then they try and be their
[SPEAKER_00]: own contractor and building it out those
are the people that do well so if there
[SPEAKER_00]: are any home growers out there who are
like you know what I love doing this I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do this for a living I want to
make a career out of it I want to move
[SPEAKER_00]: from you know let's say you're a
bookkeeper now doing accounting and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know what but I love the plants I
want to be with them every day you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: would say start reading manuals on a lot
of the technology like watch some Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Cribbs episodes because it'll give you a
lot of ideas and you'll hear these brands
[SPEAKER_00]: come up like these really sophisticated
you know elaborate ones watch a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of videos and read some manuals on
how they work and you're you're basically
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway there that's awesome yeah stuff
there so you are the owner of growers
[SPEAKER_01]: house largest retailers for equipment
you've got to have some insight on some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these new products that are coming in the
future so can you tell us can is there
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you can reveal to us is there
anything that's that's coming out that
[SPEAKER_00]: excites you yeah there is and you know
it's funny the largest retailer in the u
[SPEAKER_00]: .s.
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like we're not really the largest but
if we're like kind of the largest like
[SPEAKER_00]: single-store kind of e-commerce operation
but there's other bigger companies out
[SPEAKER_00]: there you know than us for sure but when
it comes to cool products um you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are gonna see are
so people might know of like AC and DC
[SPEAKER_00]: fans most fans are AC by you know the way
the electrical current goes but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: these EC fans coming out right now which
basically can operate with digital
[SPEAKER_00]: controls which can make them work a lot
better with controllers and they operate
[SPEAKER_00]: on way less wattage way less power and I
don't know if people in the past have been
[SPEAKER_00]: like man you know they buy like a little
rheostat or a speed adjuster for their
[SPEAKER_00]: fans and it kind of works you know it goes
from like 100 to 50 but it's like not very
[SPEAKER_00]: precise and things like that and you can't
really get from 50 to 0 like these EC fans
[SPEAKER_00]: will be like I want it at 37 percent dial
it in with an app on your phone like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and then have it change because it's
digital it's like basically the world is
[SPEAKER_00]: your oyster like as long as someone builds
the technology just to like say oh yeah at
[SPEAKER_00]: 847 I want it to go from 37 percent to 62
percent but then an hour later I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: drop another five percent because this
happens like you can do all that stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: these fans I think will end up being like
the same cost as like the AC fans too
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really cool so that's going to be
coming up on the horizon I think
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's going to see a lot more like
Wi-Fi kind of based and app-based
[SPEAKER_00]: controllers for home grow tents that are
going to be coming way down in cost I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been like working on a project helping out
some people with some stuff like that
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like a controller that you know
it's kind of modular you can end up
[SPEAKER_00]: hooking up like basically a you know like
a soil a you know soil moisture probe and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can hook it up to your fans and
then you can have like a ppm probe in your
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir and you know you can hook up a
whole bunch of other probes and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: based on this little one controller with a
touchscreen and you can also hook it to
[SPEAKER_00]: your router and check it on your phone and
your laptop anytime and that controller
[SPEAKER_00]: will probably be like like I'm helping
these guys out if actually if you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: homegrown engineering that's like a little
YouTube channel by this guy named Volker
[SPEAKER_00]: he's an engineer and a German engineer who
lives in Australia great accent love his
[SPEAKER_00]: accent just hearing him talk is like put
you know put you to put you to sleep or
[SPEAKER_00]: meditate or something but that's a cool
channel and that product will be like 299
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks or something you know like that's
cool I love I love seeing little things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that come out even on the more
sophisticated side you know there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things the interesting thing that
people don't know that much is the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial growers there's the high value
crops for this industry like there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: much investment in R&D and technology that
it's actually like spilling over into
[SPEAKER_00]: other crops because they don't have as
much profit to like invest in this so the
[SPEAKER_00]: high value crops are like driving a lot of
technological innovation right now which
[SPEAKER_00]: is awesome because we used to be like you
know the the runs in the corner that no
[SPEAKER_00]: one paid attention to and now we're like a
driving force in thought leadership but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know there's there's some very cool
applications coming out with like crop
[SPEAKER_00]: steering where it's like if you're not
familiar with the term crop steering yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: just please Google it read it really fast
pause now play again so but they're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: all these factors and you can like
basically see these really small
[SPEAKER_00]: deviations in a plant's health and then
like bring it right back to where it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to so you're not waiting a week to see how
something's going and then it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: another week to respond to it it's like
you're keeping that like what we can call
[SPEAKER_00]: home stasis or equilibrium there and
you're like riding that wave perfectly so
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff is pretty cool I think
awesome so lots of exciting things coming
[SPEAKER_00]: on to the market soon that's good to hear
oh yeah yeah and I think the cool thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're gonna see is like raspberry
pies and like home growers just making
[SPEAKER_00]: their own stuff that I'm excited for too
you know that's for sure so wrapping
[SPEAKER_01]: things up how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future yeah how can they find me um you
know Instagram's really big I like don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really go on Facebook so I think I have
one I just don't really do stuff on it
[SPEAKER_00]: that much but I have an Instagram it's
Nate dot J dot Lipton they can hit me up
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably the most popular social
media for me in the industry but yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess that's that's kind of mainly it
check out growers network org that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have a forum like a grow forum we have
like 15,000 growers on there who are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about all this stuff all day long
so that's a cool thing and man I guess I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess that's probably about it well Nate
thank you so much for coming on to the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden talk podcast today truly appreciate
it and yeah hope you enjoy the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: your day yeah it's great great spending an
hour with you this morning it's a good way
[SPEAKER_00]: to spend it so thanks Chris have a good
one okay bye you you you
