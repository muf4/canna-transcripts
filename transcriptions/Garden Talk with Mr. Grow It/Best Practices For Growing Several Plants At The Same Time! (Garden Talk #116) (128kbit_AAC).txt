[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 116.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Walter from
Doobie's House.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 12 years and
grows a variety of plants such as squash,
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, cucumbers, strawberries,
broccoli, medicinal varieties,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also has worked in several commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks about keeping
things efficient when growing multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: plants at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That channel is dedicated to short bite
sized clips of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a poll on my YouTube channel,
the channel that this podcast is posted
[SPEAKER_01]: on, and I asked how many people are aware
that I have another channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fifty three percent of people said that
they weren't aware that it had another
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have another channel and I've been
uploading for the past seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually 130 plus videos on that
channel where it shows the plants that I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have that channel linked down in the
YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their grow tent kits are incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get their Ion Board LED grow light,
their grow tent, which is currently the
[SPEAKER_01]: thickest on the market, their ventilation
system, clip on fan, and their controller
[SPEAKER_01]: 69 to control it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also get their fabric pots,
trellis net, plant ties, and tremors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a good price for all that you

[SPEAKER_01]: website, acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using stash blend for over a
year now and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I really like is
that it saves me money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole bunch of different inputs in
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I no longer have to go out there and
buy a silica bottle, then a separate
[SPEAKER_01]: seaweed bottle, beneficial bacteria,
then a separate one for mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that plus more is in this one
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to stash blend dot com to learn more
about it and also have a link down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am joined with Walter Jones from
Doobie's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've reached out to me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think it was several years ago now,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were like, Oh, I'd be willing to
come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be completely honest with you,
the list of potential guests for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is, is over 200, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the time I wasn't able to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally I was able to get you on here and
I'm really happy I'm able to get you on
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about today's conversation
because of your background, your
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have experience in commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have experience in larger operations,
experience home growing as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just medicinal plants, but vegetables
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're going to be able to
bring a lot of value to today's
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation because it has to do with
kind of making things more efficient in
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're working in a commercial
operation, and you could correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, you know, every commercial
operation is kind of different,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But efficiency is kind of a big point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they don't want to just pay
workers for standing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want processes to be done in an
efficient manner and reduce the labor
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, the labor costs that they spend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a lot of tips, a lot of
various things that they do in commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities that I think save time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also a lot of that stuff can be
translated to the home grower as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the audience is home growers
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have quite a few folks actually work
commercial facilities, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: all aspects, but for the most part,
let's talk efficiency in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, let's get into the introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we'll get into the meat and potatoes
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my name is Walter Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing some gardening for about
12 years now, a little consultant on the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get started, I just want to
thank you for having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blessing to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank you for all the hard work
you've done over the past six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've created this awesome platform here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all your viewers and your
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm just happy to be here,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into gardening maybe about back in
2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: My best friend came to me and told me he
was having a hard time finding pops of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: His pops was dealing with some glaucoma
and he needed to consume just about every
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needed to be able to function normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I was like, yeah,
I can help him out, try to find him some
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I started doing that,
me and him really got to know each other a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more, even though I already knew
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would sit down with him for maybe half
an hour and then half an hour turned into
[SPEAKER_00]: an hour, then two hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually started hanging out almost
three, four times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day he was like, yeah,
man, I just want to show me how the
[SPEAKER_00]: glaucoma kind of affects him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, you know, it's not really
painful or anything, but it's just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you get pressure in the eye,
like some valve attached to the retina.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of just builds up pressure and it
just causes them not be able to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it just made him cry a lot
as well, just for no reason, just crying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one day he consumed in front of me and
he showed me that once he consumed,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that really came to a halt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time that I've
actually seen the power of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty remarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not long after that, he asked me about
helping him do a garden in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course I was like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he gave me a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really remember the name of the
book, but I know in the book, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it told us everything about gardening from
summer crops to cold weather crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to use the rototiller to dig your
plot, build the bed, the raised bed,
[SPEAKER_00]: build your soil, compost, compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just everything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we set out, we set everything
up, did everything that summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably like 2011 we did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got some really nice fruits and
vegetables when the season was over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next year, I'm up here in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next year was 2012 and then they
actually passed medical here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just had an idea like maybe we should
put some plants in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I wasn't really trying to like
watch his pockets, but I realized that he
[SPEAKER_00]: was spending a significant amount of
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to get his medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just thought, no, it'd be a great
idea if we can just do it ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I asked him about it,
I mean, he lit up like a Christmas tree
[SPEAKER_00]: and he was like so excited that I was
interested in maybe doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he looked at me for like maybe
two minutes, just not saying anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we cannot tell my wife about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no, no problem,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I knew a guy who was
actually already kind of doing it at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went by to check out what he was
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was telling me like he had
everything already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he was just feeding, actually just
plain water through this whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he said that, it just kind of
dawned on me like, you know, we just built
[SPEAKER_00]: our own soil for gardening and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, maybe I can just do the same
thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually gave me my first two,
you know, set of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some Cali Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used some of the garden soil
and we put the seeds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything was going real smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, you know,
we ran into like the malnutrition and like
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies kicked in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the time, we didn't really know
where any of that was.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just like, we don't know what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just started doing some research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was saying, you know,
you got to go to your local, local grow
[SPEAKER_00]: store and get some stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest store to me was in Rhode
Island.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was about 35 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I still went.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went down there in the store,
the store was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen a store like that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually found myself going down
there multiple times a week, sometimes not
[SPEAKER_00]: even buying anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to go there and just pick
the brain of people who work there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was there the first time,
I noticed that some of the nutrients on
[SPEAKER_00]: the shelves was some of the stuff that we
had in the garage already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, OK, well, I'm going to go
back to the garage and mix some stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the garage with, you know,
five gallon bucket and I'm throwing bone
[SPEAKER_00]: meal, I'm throwing blood meal in there and
kelp, alfalfa, a little bottle like
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm squirting that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just stir it up, mix it up,
and then I just throw it on the panel on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, all right, I think
we're going to be in good shape now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, I'm telling you, like maybe two,
three days later, those plants look like
[SPEAKER_00]: fried chicken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so burnt up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, did the sun do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did we got some pasta or something
attacking it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we didn't have no idea what was going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm back at the grocery store asking
the guys, you know, plants look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: weird now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, did you pH it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you get your EC right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know what any of
that means, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, you got to make
sure you're doing the proper feedings and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we eventually fixed all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the end result was not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were kind of bummed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was kind of like, you know,
I think I might want to try to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: year round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, no, it's not a bad idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I could help you invest in
getting some.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went back to the store and
actually picked up the hydro farm light
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up two CFLs, one for veg,
one for bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took it home, put it in the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the aluminum foil all around the
closet to get some reflection going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Made it real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I just started growing
right in the closet at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was looking at some videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: People were saying, you know, more lights
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went back to the store, picked up
some four foot T5s, put those in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I don't know if you remember this
light, but there was a light back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called the Kessel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looked like a bigger version of a
flashlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like one of the first LEDs they
really marketed in the Grove magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked up one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had all different type of light
spectrums going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much how I got started,
you know, from the closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I felt like it wasn't big enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ended up copying a four by four and all
the extras that come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've kind of just been doing it
ever since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you started out with the vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, before we started recording,
you listed off a dozen vegetables that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been growing over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you went to a closet grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're actually, you went actually
into commercial facilities too,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you mentioned to me behind the
scenes that you, there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: different operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I see an indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How'd you get into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, I'm up here in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So around 2015, they really started to try
to open these places up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really wanted to get a job doing it
because I was doing it at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people were saying that,
you know, I was doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't know if I was doing a good
job, but they said I was doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I always kept a portfolio and I
just kept going over to the dispensary and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, no, can I get a job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get a job?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, well, they got to talk
to, it was never, it was never there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day he was finally there and
I showed him my portfolio.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, oh, you're the one that's been
coming around here for a job, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, well, your pictures look nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I'm going to hire you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that was actually my first
gig back in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the greenhouse work that came
later on, that's actually down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some family down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 2018, my brother called me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, you know, I think Oklahoma is
about to get the green light down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wanted to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been, I was trying to teach him
like over, over Skype, over video.
[SPEAKER_00]: He called me every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent him some seeds, try to get him
going, try to show him the ropes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually he took what he learned
from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he showed his business partner
and then they got more partners and they
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up opening quite a few things down
there in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard Oklahoma is pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more freedom than some of the other
states out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild west down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty wild west, but right now I hear
they're trying to clean it up a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good thing to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of to bring it to where you
are now, you had mentioned behind the
[SPEAKER_01]: scenes that you're doing consulting now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've kind of stepped away from the
commercial facilities, still doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: home grow and stuff like that,
but you're doing consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that work out for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been working out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people, I started this
back in maybe 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I even did the, before I had Doobie
South, I actually called myself Natural
[SPEAKER_00]: Remedy because back in 2012 when I was
doing the closet grow and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually his name's Clarence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clarence actually became, I became
Clarence's caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we got all licensed and approved
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I became his caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing everything for him mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on down like 2015,
working in dispensaries and then like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just dawned on me that I wanted to do
something more like on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a lot of people at the time that
wanted to learn how to do this because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, it was so new around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wanted to try to get their hands
in on the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured, you know, I could start
doing this, helping people out,
[SPEAKER_00]: start them off slow, show them how to do
it from, from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people really wanted to get
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was willing to help them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine you have clients that are
kind of looking to get the information
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're about to speak today,
which is making things more efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a large number of plants and being
efficient with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's transition to that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I want to start with the
beginning, really germinating,
[SPEAKER_01]: planting seeds and cutting clones,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about those things in an
efficient manner?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually like to start my seeds either in
the solo cup or the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let those sit in the cup until,
you know, the taproot pops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper towel method, anywhere between 48,
72 hours, you might get the taproot
[SPEAKER_00]: popping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then shortly after that, I kind of
just transitioned that into maybe a four
[SPEAKER_00]: inch pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be its home for
several weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't really move it out of that
pot until I get a really good root
[SPEAKER_00]: structure built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the plant get like six to seven
inches tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I even talk about the plants
getting tall, the way I go about it is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, before I even plant the seed,
I like to put the soil in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use like a mister.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really go heavy with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to miss the top of the soil,
you know, poke your hole, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: put the taproot down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually put plastic bags over the cup
or over the pot just to keep the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: up because, you know, you need to get the
seed in at least 90% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get the seed to break the seed
coat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I do with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I usually let it stay in that pot
for at least probably three, three and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half weeks, maybe four weeks before I
transplant to the final pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My final pots are usually either one
gallon or two gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like those more because it's like
more control of your watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like easier not to overwater
your plants with a smaller pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people have trouble
starting off because they usually know
[SPEAKER_00]: water too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think small parts of other way to
go for when you start off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned the paper towel method
and I want to talk about that for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use the paper towel method quite
a bit and very common method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's one of the first things you
learn is to put the, soak the seeds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper towel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once you see it cracked open,
you plant it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people who just go
straight into the soil and they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, more efficient, easier, skip the
paper towel method, just go right into
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you're growing hundreds of
plants at once, germinating hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds at once, it's more efficient to put
it into a paper towel, see which ones
[SPEAKER_01]: crack open and then plant those ones
versus planting a hundred different seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: into grow pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're finding out which ones pop
and which ones don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I thought that was a really good
efficient tip that I heard from somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: when talking about just planting in the
soil and saving time and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody replied and they're like,
no, no, not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plant a hundred seeds at a time and
paper towels much more efficient for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that was a great point to bring
up since we are talking about efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: here is, uh, yeah, the paper towel method
can be more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing a large number of seeds,
then you'll see which ones are good,
[SPEAKER_01]: which ones are not, and you're not wasting
time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now how about mixing soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about, you're growing organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in your soil mix and how do you go
about the mixing process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I never really, uh, I never really
grow an organic, but like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: for medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've, I've tried it once with,
um, I heard a lot of good things with,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, what's the name of that company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast of Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coast of Maine is supposed to have really
good, uh, like super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the one time I really wanted to
try it, I got a really bad bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so many bugs in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was horrible, horrible experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the garden goes,
um, when we built the bed for the garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, we just use like a bone meal,
blood meal, alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we had kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually used, uh, European night
crawlers instead of using worm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, vermiculite, perlite, uh, you know,
mix it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you throw it in the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let the bed cook, you know,
all that stuff you put in there is really
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we let the bed cook for like maybe two,
three weeks before we actually put plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it went about building our
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said for container size,
you're starting out in solo cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: have those in there for about three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're transitioning, you're doing
one transplant, correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: to your final container, which is one or
two gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the question I had was using organic
in such a small pot, but you just
[SPEAKER_01]: corrected me that you're actually using
bottled nutrients or mineral based
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What brand are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I mean, I'm kind of all over the
place to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've tried almost everything on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first start off, you see,
so many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Oh, I got to try all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to buy this one first and buy
this one next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, over the past couple of years,
I've, you know, I've dibbled and dabbled
[SPEAKER_00]: with like, uh, raw salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the raw salts a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but my last store actually used Kana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like Kana too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kana has really good nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used, uh, the Tera, Tera blend,
the Tera is called Vega, Tera Vega,
[SPEAKER_00]: Tera Vega blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good, uh, pretty good line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how do you go about the
transplanting process?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've got so many plants you can
really spend a lot of time transplanting,
[SPEAKER_01]: or there are things you can do to make
things more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do the transplanting process
and keep things efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I mean, that's a hard one because,
uh, I don't think there's any really
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient way to get 300 plants in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, other than just lining them up,
dumping the soil and trying to transplant
[SPEAKER_00]: them as quick as possible and get them
under the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's how we usually do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we just line them up,
uh, dump it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we would, uh, build the whole open,
make the hole for the, for the new,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the new, uh, transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we use some Michael Ryze, but you
know, put a little something in there for
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, for the, for the roots to be
happy other than just dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, that was most, that was like the
most efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're not doing it by yourself,
of course, but like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe two guys, three guys, and just kind
of have a nice chain going down the line
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting them, getting them all parted
up and put into their new home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've done your transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in your final container,
which is one or two gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: When does your first feeding happen and
what does that consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: My first feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really depends on what medium
we're using, what medium I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried different, uh,
different styles of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've tried DWC, you know, I really
liked the WC, um, very efficient,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, super fast plant grill is probably
twice the, twice the rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's just constantly eating water
all day and food all day, um, less
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance, it's definitely less
maintenance when you grow a DWC style.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, coco core, uh, that's kind of time
consuming as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes you got to, um, charge the
bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bricks aren't charged, you got to
charge them up, or you got to inflate them
[SPEAKER_00]: because they'll come all like compressed
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get them uncompressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but on the larger scale, we kind of
went toward the other ones, towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: mesh bag that already kind of had the hole
in it for your Rockwell cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of made things really
quicker and efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're not, you're not, you know,
putting a bunch of stuff and put a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil stuff in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The holes there, all we're doing is taking
the clone from the clone dome and dumping
[SPEAKER_00]: it right into the new hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that made things really efficient for
us when it's time to transplant the
[SPEAKER_00]: clones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as feedings, we're using
raw or we're using Kana at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I, my first feeding is probably,
well, so I use, so it's tough because I
[SPEAKER_00]: use Fox farm sometimes and we know,
um, Fox farm runs pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm using the ocean forest,
I probably won't feed for a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, but if you use the happy frog,
um, you know, you can probably start
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding your first feed probably two weeks
in two and a half weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it'd be on the lighter side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I probably do something like a,
a 1.0 EC, something that's really light
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, pH is around, uh, six two to six
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm in soil, uh, if I'm in cocoa,
it might be more around five, nine to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for 300 plants, I mean,
what size of container are you mixing that
[SPEAKER_01]: in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are you in a large reservoir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a, uh, automated system drip
system or like, how does that work out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that would be on that definitely the
irrigation and fertigation for all those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are staking everything,
uh, having each each, uh, each pot
[SPEAKER_00]: probably get two stakes each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how we would go about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's just hooked up to a
reservoir and it's just dripping down on
[SPEAKER_01]: that throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was it like once a week or something,
you're changing up the ratio of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in the reservoir or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would, uh, we would change up the
recipe, not the recipe, we would change up
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we like to probably do like some
microfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know microfeeding is pretty big in the
commercial field, but they would do a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of microfeeding when I was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we probably water three to four times
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think they kind of like switched up
the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it would be heavier in the
morning and then toward the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, we kind of give it on the lighter
side, just so get that balance in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't get any type of like nutrient
burn or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So switching things up a little bit,
let's get into lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've worked in indoor operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at your Instagram right now
and there's just tons of lights stacked
[SPEAKER_01]: down the entire way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips for lighting such as
like grow like distance or dimming par,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my share of plenty of lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually think, um, I like T fives a
lot in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just so fluorescent, a little,
little less intensity for the plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually have the plants like
kissing the lights and it will do no harm
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the par.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our nose is usually between two and 300,
which is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, of course in veg, you want to be a
little stronger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause you want the veg, you kind of
want the blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the blues are anywhere between 400 and
500 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, vet and I'm in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be a little higher,
maybe in between six and 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, if you haven't any type
of like, um, if your plants are starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to stretch a little too much on your
tables and you're not liking the stretch
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can always lower your lights and
that will help stop the stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your plants are too squat and you
kind of want them to stretch a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more, then you raise your lights up a
little bit, probably between 18 and 20
[SPEAKER_00]: inches just to get them in the stretch up
a little more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, another big thing is,
uh, environment with the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, um, if you have a huge swing
difference between your daytime light and
[SPEAKER_00]: your night time temperatures, I know that
also causes a little bit of stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can really get your environment
dialed in to where the temperature kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stays the same, it is during the day when
the lights on, that would also avoid your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not looking to get them too
tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what temperature do you typically aim
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically aim for, um, in between 80 and
84.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now I run an LED and,
uh, the temperature kind of stays
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent around 84 right now in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's winter time, so the winter
time here is tough because there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: no, uh, no humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I have it set up right now on my
tent is, um, I actually leave the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the back, the back vent open and I leave
the one of the side vents open and I kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get, I kind of put a fan on the outside
of the tent that kind of blows air through
[SPEAKER_00]: the side vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, I have a fan also clipped to
the pole for circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, my temperature kind of stays
really steady between, um, 84,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, for temperature and my humidity is
always low because it's just so dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the winter time, humidity here
is probably 20, lucky to be 25 or 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do use a humidifier and veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to, you know, I try to get it up
to at least 45 and veg means it's real,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's better in the summertime here because
the humidity is a little high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be at 45 or 50 during the day,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but, um, I have, um, also have
central heat where I live right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of helps keep my temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this didn't stay anywhere at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can use the central heat,
but I don't have central air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use an AC unit for the window and
that really helps me keep my temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: down and having the AC in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, with, with the, and when the
lights are on, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, 84 in the winter, but in the
summertime, when I have the lights on,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably in between 80, 81 as high as
it would get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, as far as when the lights off,
my temperatures usually drop like maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or nine degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My humidity in the, in the summertime is,
um, stays kind of consistent around that
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 range just cause it's outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hot, but in the winter,
that's when it gets real rough around
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to use a humidifier to
keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my temperature stay in between there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're never really higher than
no 84 with the led that I run right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you adding CO2 into the grow space in
order to try to get better growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually tried CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I first started, I was actually
making my own CO2, just getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular little like Coke bottle,
soda bottle, and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: using yeast and sugar and then letting it
do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I cook its thing, you know,
in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I started buying the
exhale bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I tried the canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried the CO2 pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all seem to do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but right now I don't really use it
because, um, I have a monitor and usually
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 in my house already is around 600
ppm, which is not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really try to supplement more
CO2 if I don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get pretty good yields right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I do, I do dibble and dabble with
it if necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried it and, um, they work,
you know, they're very efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can see the difference on the
end result when, uh, when it's all said
[SPEAKER_00]: and done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can definitely be helpful, you know,
especially if you are running a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher of temps, you know, which you kind
of are with the 84 degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that additional CO2 can help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course having the highlighting can
also help with the growth for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into training plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I can only imagine 300 plants and
having to train all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've talked to other folks that worked
in cultivate cultivation facilities in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past and they avoid some parts of training
because it takes so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about how you do plant training
when you're working in these facilities or
[SPEAKER_01]: when you worked in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just say, was there a certain type of
training you would do for all the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether where the training that you would
avoid to do because there's some time
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming or what would you typically do
for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we typically try to avoid to do any
type of low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it would just take too long for the,
for the plant to recover or get to where
[SPEAKER_00]: we want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you're in a commercial field,
everything's on a timeline, everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything feels kind of rushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really no time to do anything
extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we didn't really do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our training or trying to low stress
train anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we did do, we did a whole lot of
femme topping and that was like one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: main things we did a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never really did any like, like,
like, uh, topping, topping, like regular
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, like cutting branches or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we just didn't want to do that
unless we were taking clones off the moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, we did a lot of femme
topping to get more tops and more shoots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when we put them in the flower,
you know, we do, we do, uh, we put up the
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis up, we'll put them through the
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, we will actually
remove any branches that were kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: crisscrossing across the table,
hitting other plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about as far as we got with going
with training.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just didn't want too much stuff
touching each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, try to avoid getting powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to have good airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to have no thrips showing
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would cut off any branches that were
crisscrossing with each other or just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't fit, fit well in the, in the
trellis on the bench.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, would you limit the topping or
femming actually you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you limit that to once per growth
cycle only in the veg or were you femming
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant multiple times in veg?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume you avoid doing that in
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we avoid it in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would actually probably fem top twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll fem top early in veg, maybe a couple
of weeks in, and then we do it again right
[SPEAKER_00]: before we send them over to the flower
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it again just to get some
additional topics going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, in the end it worked
out, you know, you're going there with
[SPEAKER_00]: just maybe eight tops, you know,
we could go and we do a fem before going
[SPEAKER_00]: there and then we'll have 16 tops,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smart going after the fem in a commercial
operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, not only does it help promote
that bottom growth, those branches growing
[SPEAKER_01]: up, but you're getting more than just a
couple of tops coming femming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be three or four tops coming from
that one fem area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes sense that that's used in a
commercial operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, I feel like people
should use it more in home grow operations
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally feel like I should use it
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Femming is easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to get it in the right
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried to fem so many times and it
just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've topped the plant before and
accidentally turned into a fem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely takes a little bit of
practice getting that perfect spot to
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's actually going to fem and go
into four different tops versus just two.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, good tip for training there and
making things more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, pruning plants, you talked about how
you would remove branches that were kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of overlapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: With other plants, that's one form of
pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about like lollipopping to where
you're moving the lower third or lower
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter growth of the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you do that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to loop in defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're moving leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you do that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we do that, so actually when we
put up the trellis, the first trellis that
[SPEAKER_00]: actually goes up, that's kind of like the
baseline for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wherever that trellis lands on the
table, anything below that first trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: baseline is going to be stripped off so we
can transfer all that energy right to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the plant, get really good colors
and vigorous growth from the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that started to take off,
you put your second trellis on to support
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's how we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do it like that and we would
defoliate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defoliate all through the whole plant
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I always tell people, I always ask
people, do you like haircuts?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll be like, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these plants love haircuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always good to give the plant a
haircut.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some folks get a little worried
about taking off so many fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh no, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't realize that you're going
to take all these leaves off today and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be fully back to what it was
seven days later like you did nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, oh no, you was
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, I mean, these plants
just love haircuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would defoliate all cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: During flower, we would actually defoliate
and do the pruning or the lollipop before
[SPEAKER_00]: they go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would do it again,
maybe 20, 25 days later, we go in and do
[SPEAKER_00]: another heavy strip and then just kind of
let it ride out from there until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we may take a little more fan
leaves off during before harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we like to keep as many leaves on as
possible toward the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then question for when you're in veg,
you mentioned stripping things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you doing that every single day or
were you like limiting to every three
[SPEAKER_01]: days, every five days or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say we were doing maybe every,
every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sometimes we would just pick off
leaves, just to pick off leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think it was no, no taking up too
much light blocking the lowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: we just pull it off, pull off one leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we would, we would wait,
you know, maybe a week or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go in there, hit it hard,
know how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back plan to be much bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go in there, hit it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it get much bigger?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it lay, we're going to have
to move with the flower and that's when we
[SPEAKER_00]: really give it no, no, the full haircut
that we want to give it or it takes off
[SPEAKER_00]: and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any tips for the flowering stage to kind
of make things more efficient there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely use the trellis, put your
trellis up, um, keep the room clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have a clean environment,
make sure you have proper airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know a lot of people like to chase a
VP D.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really big thing in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not really a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's very dangerous playing with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dangerous game, but if you have a
down pack, no hats off to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know, um, I mean, that's one of the
things we did a lot that we, we did chase
[SPEAKER_00]: the VP D where I worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was, it was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it causes a little problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to make sure you have the
proper airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you don't want to get any pests
showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the main reason,
um, you got to be really careful when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're playing with the VP D.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people just will ignore VP
D because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some, uh, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running a higher humidity, which is what
most of these VP D charts call for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately there are several
different VP D charts on the internet
[SPEAKER_01]: today and they contradict with each other
and that makes things so confusing for
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, it usually calls
for a higher humidity in the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stage where if you're running a higher
humidity and you don't have good air flow,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, you get bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that I've come across that
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, not good at all to be in
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you spot bud rot
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to chop off colas and get rid of
them or even powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, one of the root causes is
stagnant air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the good air flow, but yeah,
I know a lot of people would just ignore
[SPEAKER_01]: VP D because of that though, no matter
what, even though if it calls for above
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% RH in flower, they'll still keep a
lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they don't even want to risk
getting any sort of powdery mildew or any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's move on to harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing where it's like,
you know, when we're talking about large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale, 300 plants, harvesting that it's
got to be very time consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chopping down plants, moving them around,
getting them from the flower room to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dry room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us a little harvesting,
how you go about making things efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you just got to have a lot of people
on hands that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to have everybody in the
building, all hands on deck for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a constant train of chopping,
passing it down the line, tagging it,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it on the dolly, taking it down to
the dry room, hanging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, we can take down maybe a 300 plant
room and probably an hour, hour and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: tops, you know, get everything down and
hung up in the other room, weighed,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the wet weight, weigh it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the only way I think that
you can really be efficient is just have
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody all hands on deck that day
because it's going to be a long day
[SPEAKER_00]: without having a lot of hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's similar for a lot of home grow
operations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when I was running 12 large plants
and I'm maxed out here at 12 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a small home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can grow in my state is 12
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go above that legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I usually call up all my friends,
hey, come on over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're harvesting or even trimming,
you know, all hands on deck for trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's a very time consuming
process now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have bowl trimmer now and a bunch of
machine trimming now, which makes things a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more efficient, but all hands on deck
back in the day when we were just using
[SPEAKER_01]: hand trimmers the entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could totally relate to that on a
home grow standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to circle back because
we actually tried a couple of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things when we harvest them before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one time we tried actually
harvesting individual branches and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was just like, oh, you know, I mean,
it works, but that definitely takes up a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of figured, you know, chopping
down the whole plant at the base made
[SPEAKER_00]: things a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just hang the whole plant, space it out
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That saved us a whole lot of time just
chopping the whole plant rather than doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the individual branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume you're taking all those into a
specific room for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your drying conditions,
temperature and humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that's really preference
for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everyone has their preference where
they think the sweet spot is.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the commercial side, you know,
they used to play around with it quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen them run 60%
temperature, 45% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll put it at 55,
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like to kind of like fluctuate it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like they'll go three days at 60,
60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next three days they'll drop it
down to like 55, 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to like super dry it,
but then give it back moisture a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, but they take it away again.
[SPEAKER_00]: They give it back to it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really want to get that real slow
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want to be chopping
down too early and flash dry anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you just wasted the whole,
however long it took you to grow that
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to ruin it because you flash
dried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they played around with it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal preference, you know,
my last harvest I just took down,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually ran 65, 62, and it worked out
pretty well for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you what your personal
preference was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about like length of dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you like to dry for a number
of days?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the really slow dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going 14, maybe 17 days if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, then, you know, I'll pull it
before it gets too, too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know we're supposed to,
I know, you know, the, the grow bros
[SPEAKER_00]: always say, you know, you want to wait
till it gets to that point where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the branches are snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that might be a little too,
too, too long of a drag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause now everything is going to be kind
of crunchy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I kind of wait for the stems to be
a little, a little bendy to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: might snap, but they're not going to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of the perfect,
perfect time that I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it down, chop it and trim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after drying comes curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like, I like turkey bags,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about anybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm like old school with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like turkey bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of things on the
market these days, you know, sea vaults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my buddy just gave me these new bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what they call.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, yeah, man, this thing preserves
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, man, just go get some
turkey bags, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wasting your money on these bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, turkey bags work well,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you eat the turkey bag,
you get your, um, your thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's say that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the thing that monitors
what's going on inside the, outside the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag as far as humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I try to keep, uh, when my,
when my buds actually turn, I try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it between like 55 and 60 on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it goes below that or above it,
you know, I kind of just crack it off,
[SPEAKER_00]: gas it and kind of do a hard reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully it goes back to where I want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, on a larger scale, I mean,
when I was in the commercial field,
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't really do any of that turkey
bag stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just used, uh, they just line up
these totes with plastic, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in there and close the plastic
lids and kind of just waited it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, just kept everything in the dry
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, the dry room is cold,
so they just kept everything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep everything in a, in a dark,
cool, cool environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good storage conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, were they opening up the bins to burp
them on a daily basis or what was the
[SPEAKER_01]: process for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were burping those at least once
a day, you know, smelt the maize and too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, we'd burp them once a day,
try to off gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do that for probably a week,
two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we just kind of keep
it shut, you know, let, let the nuggets do
[SPEAKER_00]: its thing, you know, we're going in maybe
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, it goes off to
packaging and then off to the store and
[SPEAKER_01]: then people buy it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we just went from seed all the
way through harvest drying and curing
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't talk about that at any,
uh, tips for trimming, making that more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the way, the way to make trimmer
more efficient, honestly, is make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any, uh, any popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you have all nice big colors
that makes trimming a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I mean, uh, trim machines are
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they do knock off a lot of
trichomes, but some of them are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know people like the wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet trim is not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done some wet trimming and then we
just hang it up in the net and let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I would say just,
you know, try to avoid popcorn nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the bigger, the bigger, the bigger you
can get your nuggets and your colas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it'd be easier on the backend
when it's time to trim it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get it out to the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seems to be pretty split between people
who prefer wet trim or dry trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50 really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all with all the people I've
talked over the years, it's one or the
[SPEAKER_01]: other and, uh, they're hardcore on their
stance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally like the dry trim and,
uh, I do the same thing with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about like larfy buds or the
popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those actually nowadays just end up in my
trim pile to where I'm using that for
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles really for oil, butter,
and then making edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've gotten less and less picky
about trimming up larf or popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes in my trim pile and then I
just keep the top nuggets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you have any other tips just overall
for making things more efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout any part of the growth cycle
that we didn't cover yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, just be patient, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, gardening and growing in general,
it's just patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when you're on the commercial side,
you can feel kind of rushed, but things
[SPEAKER_00]: feel kind of rushed, but just be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything's not going to be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do what you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I mean, patience is key,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's gardening is supposed to be
relaxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be patient with everything you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you're going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing's going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a big difference between
being efficient and cutting corners,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and cutting corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's going to potentially get you
into hot water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing things where you really
shouldn't be doing it, you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: only to save time, but you're risking
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, big difference between being
efficient and cutting corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us how the listeners can find you and
do you have anything upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Instagram at Doobie's
House.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, if you got questions about
gardening or need help with something,
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respond and reply to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always willing to help any and everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as coming up, you know,
I would really like to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: expand my, you know, my consulting
services a little better, maybe try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: in more, more commercial side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, maybe start some environmental
monitoring as far as going in with like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Petri dishes, uh, some sponges and
some in an ATP meter to trying to help
[SPEAKER_00]: people out with, uh, figure out if they
have any like mold or yeast and mold and
[SPEAKER_00]: other bacteria is flying around their,
uh, grow rooms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, scrubbing down surfaces,
uh, checking the trim machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other machinery they might use that
may carry yeast and mold or other
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking forward to trying to know,
expand my, um, my services into doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as, uh, coming up, that's about
everything I got coming up with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a link to your Instagram down in
the YouTube description section below at
[SPEAKER_01]: Doobie's house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walter, thank you so much for coming on
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been awesome to be able to listen
to how you do things in the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, as well as you also gave us
insight on your home growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's great to have that vast
amount of experience and then hearing
[SPEAKER_01]: about the efficiency side of things,
which is something we really haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: covered much on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for giving us your insight and,
uh, hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
