[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode 103.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 17 years and is
the owner of Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has an extensive amount of knowledge
when it comes to reusing soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's today's topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also get into pH in living soil,
organic fertilizers, heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to bring free
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening information of all plants to the
general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boveda is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the Boveda 58% and 62%
humidity packs for six years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they do a fantastic job at ensuring my
flowers are at the ideal moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their humidity packs help maintain a
stable environment, protecting against
[SPEAKER_01]: tricone damage, terpene loss, over-drying,
and mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out their website at bovedainc.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's B-O-V-E-D-A-I-N-C dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also have a link in the YouTube
description section of this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to AAC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now have supplemental lighting called
the Ion Beam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Ion Beam S11 grow light bars,
which are 11 inches long and use Samsung
[SPEAKER_01]: LM301H diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also have the Ion Beam S16,
which are 16 inches long and use the same
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with a light controller with four
light intensity levels and timer settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: their supplemental lighting, and the
discount code MRGRODE15 works on both
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon and their website, AACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Tad Hussie.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to get into reusing
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many indoor growers will start off with
a bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it for one grow and then they'll
either dump in their backyard or dump into
[SPEAKER_01]: their trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little did I know that soil can be reused,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow after grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some things that you're
going to want to do with that soil prior
[SPEAKER_01]: to reusing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're going to get
into in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to pick your brain on pH in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot topic for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic fertilizers, heavy metals and
microbial inoculants if we have time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, what I do with all guests is an
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew up around plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents owned a nursery landscape
company on seven acres in Redmond,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been around plants my entire life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't really into it though growing up
until after college.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back from Australia with a master's
degree in special education and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to get a little burnt out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my parents had sold their nursery
landscape company and started a business
[SPEAKER_00]: selling and manufacturing compost tea
brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to start learning about soil
biology and microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really sparked some of the
scientists in me and got me back
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in plants and gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in 2011, we opened a seven acre
farm and feed store with an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroshop, outdoor preschool, edible
nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had chickens, pigs, ducks, goats all
running around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really cool experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did that until 2017 or 2018 when we
ended up shutting that down right before
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have an online business focused
around manufacturing living soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: providing soil amendments and really
working with people on how to properly
[SPEAKER_00]: amend and reuse your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just going to the garden
center and buying a fertilizer for
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes because it has a picture of a
tomato on it, but you're actually looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at like, what does my soil really need to
optimize soil fertility for that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you from Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of good organic products
and you have a lot of knowledge in regards
[SPEAKER_01]: to reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad we get to pick your brain on
it today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also are a fellow podcaster,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk a little bit about that
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Cannabis Cultivation and
Science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a high level technical podcast
for people who really want to dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to be growing
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of gardeners that tune in
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to hear what some of the
latest research is, we've actually had
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the same guests on like Bryant
Mason is a good example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soil doctor consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't listened, to the podcast
that you did with him, I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend people check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just launched a new podcast
called Dope History.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of capturing the
narratives, purely educational of people
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry who came before us that
really like set the tone and gave up a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: to get us to where we are now with the
legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those are two podcasts that I
have going right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to tune into the
Dope Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's anything like your other
podcast, it's probably a must listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll definitely have to spend some time
listening to those episodes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the guests we have for season one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to mention we got like Tommy
Chong, Ed Rosenthal, Keith Stropp,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of really awesome people for season
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, please do check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of folks that are using
synthetic nutrients in their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first I want to ask, can you reuse soil
that synthetic nutrients were added into
[SPEAKER_01]: during a past growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, how would you go about reusing that
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of a complicated answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I want to say I'm an organic
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stick to organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I'm not cultish about it by any
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for people who are using chemical
nutrients, I think there's a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that get misconstrued.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the organic side, and the first one is
that chemical nutrients or synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients kill microbes and they ruin your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just simply not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put out too many and your soluble
salt levels get too high, then yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get osmotic shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it difficult for the
microorganisms to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can damage the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's why you don't run high EC anyway with
synthetic salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low level minerals of mineral-based
nutrients actually are shown to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganism activity and have benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at what the giant pumpkin
growers are doing, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing a combination of organics
and synthetics as a way of maximizing
[SPEAKER_00]: their yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while personally I don't use those
products, I don't by any means just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight out say that they're bad if we're
looking at it strictly from a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can absolutely reuse those soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the one thing to be aware of when you
go to reuse those soils, if you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity to do soil tests, that will tell
you what sorts of availability you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: what nutrients you have at sufficiency and
where you may need to re-amend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you did apply high levels,
like if you ran a full cycle of just
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nutrients, chemical nutrients,
you may have soluble salt levels that are
[SPEAKER_00]: above what we want ideally for our next
crop, depending on what we're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lettuces, for example, are going to need a
lot less nutrients than tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers or corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to flush that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not going to test,
one easy way to reuse your media,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's organic or synthetic,
is just to run a fair bit of water through
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if it's outside, it's probably going to
rain depending on where you are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of that is going to leach out
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some environmental concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: about leaching phosphates and nitrates and
things into our water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to definitely be
cognizant of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're strictly talking about
reusing that soil, you absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually asked the same question
to Jeff Lowenfeld.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an excellent guest on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you might have had him on your
podcast in the past as well, but asked him
[SPEAKER_01]: about reusing soil where synthetic
nutrients were used.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, add it to your compost pile,
let the microbes work it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: and eventually work it back into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like what you had mentioned that if
somebody's looking to use that soil back
[SPEAKER_01]: to back, they don't have time to put it
into a compost pile, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: just flushing the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jeff's a good friend of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a character too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great to have on podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can never hear him speak live.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to add to that is when
we're talking about chemical nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's important to understand the pathway
to plants when we are adding organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers versus synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're adding chemical fertilizers,
you're essentially skipping that micro
[SPEAKER_00]: pathway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need to break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could add it to a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to disagree with Jeff slightly
on that in the sense that the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really need to break it down because
it's already in a plant available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless it's leached through the soil,
those plants are going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: access it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we apply something like alfalfa meal
or fish meal or some sort of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, for the most part,
it needs to go through that microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction, what's called the microbial
loop where the alfalfa meal gets broken
[SPEAKER_00]: down by the microorganisms, the bacteria,
archaea, fungi, protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then through that prey and predation
cycle, it gets converted into an ionic
[SPEAKER_00]: form, which your chemical fertilizer is
already in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the folks that are using soil and
they are growing organically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They only have organic inputs were added
to the soil on that previous growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to reuse that soil for their
next growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you go about reusing that soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is a little bit tricky
because I realize a lot of growers can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford to get their soil tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not practical to test it every
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to make the best data-driven
decision, then we have to use a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are going to run you about 50
bucks through a company like Bryant and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like Logan Labs just because that's
where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever lab you go with, stick with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Washington state, if you live in
King County, you can use the extension
[SPEAKER_00]: service to get a really basic soil test
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you get five free lifetime tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to check with your local
plant extension universities to see what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of options there are there for
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if testing is off the table,
then what I like to do is I like to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the plant and see what sorts of things
am I able to tell from my last cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did the plant have any deficiencies
that have any toxicities that were
[SPEAKER_00]: visually available for me to see?
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then I'm going to amend
conservatively realizing that every time I
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest a plant, whether that's a tomato,
a lettuce plant, a medicinal plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling out nutrients from that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling out organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling out biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those things, in theory,
need to be replaced because this isn't a
[SPEAKER_00]: closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to probably add back in maybe
a little bit of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to add in some more nitrogen and
a little bit more phosphorus, things that
[SPEAKER_00]: may have been leached out or consumed more
rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is another one that is fairly
mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure to put those back
in in low levels to at least maintain
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficiency in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are a lot of people that are
actually grabbing the native soil in their
[SPEAKER_01]: backyard and doing things to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recommend that, like adding in
fertilizer, for example, some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration, inoculating with microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you recommend folks do that instead of
going out and buying a bagged potting soil
[SPEAKER_01]: from their local nursery, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just like native soils,
compost, potting soils, all those can vary
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a bit in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I just moved to Fox Island here
in Washington state, and we are within
[SPEAKER_00]: like 10 or 15 miles of an area that had an
old smelter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the amount of heavy metals in our
soils is really high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I lived in a city, for example,
where I knew there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: disturbance, there's been a lot of
leaching and things that may have come
[SPEAKER_00]: into contact, like let's say I'm trying to
grow in like a sidewalk area or somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: that was close to a road, I would be a
little more cautious to bring that
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if I lived on acreage in the woods
and that soil was of good quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we could talk about how to amend that
or use that for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like here, I won't use my native soil
for growing anything I plan on consuming,
[SPEAKER_00]: any edible crops, just because of the fact
that I know our soil is quite high in
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals here in the area that I'm in,
and I just don't think it's safe for my
[SPEAKER_00]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to get into heavy metals
here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a topic that isn't talked about
enough, in my opinion, so I can't wait to
[SPEAKER_01]: dive into that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's say that folks aren't able
to use the native soil in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either they can't do it or they simply
prefer using a bagged potting mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: What brands do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Lino, let me back up real quick
before I answer that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're talking about evaluating
soils or potting soil, which is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: technically soilless media, even what
we're calling living soil today is really
[SPEAKER_00]: a soilless media because it doesn't
contain actual sand, silt, and clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I look for is sort of this picture
like a triangle or a tripod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the three things that I'm looking at
is one, the physical properties of that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does it drain?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well does it retain nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of porosity does it have?
[SPEAKER_00]: How compact is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What ability do the roots have to
penetrate deeper into that soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the physical properties of
that soil that's really important for
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy plants, gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, hydrology, all of that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next aspect is the biological aspect
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can kind of cut that out if we're
going straight to synthetic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if we're using an organic system,
it's that biology that's obviously really
[SPEAKER_00]: important for cycling nutrients and making
them into a plant available form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last aspect of the fertility
is the actual minerals in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the amount of nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, sulfur,
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium, all of our major essential plant
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of where I start in my head
when I'm thinking about using a soil or
[SPEAKER_00]: using a potting soil, whatever the media
is, is really, you know, how do I address
[SPEAKER_00]: or adjust those three things to make sure
they're optimal for whatever plant I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then when we get into brands of potting
soil, that's a little bit of a tricky
[SPEAKER_00]: question because I formulate and
manufacture potting soil for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously I'm biased.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think if you're paying money for
soil, you should absolutely ask for a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the very least, they should be able
to explain to you a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_00]: why they formulated the soil the way they
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you were to call my company,
I'd be able to tell you everything about
[SPEAKER_00]: our soil, why we add what we do,
what it's good for growing, what it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: good for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I wouldn't grow blueberries
in most of our soils without adding sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust the pH because it's too high in
that plant's soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so actually I want to get a little bit
deeper into your soil because your Kiss
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics soil, technically it's a super
soil, right, to where you can just plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in it and then it should last the entire
growth cycle without any additional inputs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be added in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if so, can you actually just talk to
us a little bit about that soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super soil was actually a term that
was, I believe, trademarked by Scott's
[SPEAKER_00]: Miracle Grow way back in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to change my label.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was sort of the common term back
in the day when people were growing in TGA
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been around the industry for a
little while, that's sort of where it all
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were one of the first ones making
these super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now people call them living soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the latest term that's really
popular or water only soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea is that we pack as much
fertility, balanced fertility into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil at the beginning of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really you're not having to add
nutrients or fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just water your plants and get a
good, healthy, organic harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that too is complicated
because if you try to grow in a three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot, you're going to get very
different results than if you were growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in a 30 gallon pot or in a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you're familiar with this
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to use up the fertility in a
small pot quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this idea, this claim of being able to
go the full cycle without any other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients is really dependent on the
amount of nutrients and how long that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to be in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for medicinal plants, a tomato,
a seven gallon pot is sort of the minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: size I like to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have a lot of guys growing in
raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've actually done some scientific
trials at facilities and discovered that
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grown communally in beds outperform
plants grown in individually in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if that soil, so for example,
if I took a plant and put it in a pot by
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, an isolated container and gave it
more soil by volume, let's say 30 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I took a bed, a yard of soil and
put 12 plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of soil per plant is going to
be lower in the bed, but that plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bed is going to out yield the one in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually have researched to back
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's available on our website.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can look at that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, yes, the idea being that if
you, if you plant the plants, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: in our soil or in a living soil,
that's well balanced, you can go the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, just water at the end of the cycle,
you're going to harvest your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll take out the above ground biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stock, the leaves, um, and,
and take that away, utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what we do, whatever root matter
comes with it is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we don't worry about excess root
hairs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, we've typically done a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were like a commercial grower at a
facility and we would re-amend that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: based off of that soil test that we took
two weeks earlier, uh, with exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: that bed needs to get it ready for the
next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 24 to 36 hours, we're bringing in
our next flowering crop and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: running that for another cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're reusing the media and we have
some guys who have been doing this for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, upwards of five to eight years
in the same soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they've never had to replace the
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we know it works and they're,
they're growing some of the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, product here in Washington and some of
the other states that we've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reusing my soil for probably
like two to three years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I, I was one of the ones
that believe that you can't reuse soil if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using synthetics in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, luckily I learned that you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I switched over to Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been reusing the soil with
organics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's what I've been reusing
the soil with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been working out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no need to go to the
nursery every single gross cycle and spend
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds of dollars on, on bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a one parter that you
can use throughout the whole growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I haven't been doing follow-up
soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the, you know, I'm just a small
home grower growing six to 12 plants max.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me sending out soil tests, every single
grow, it's just, I should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be doing that and really
balancing and buying the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments and, you know, amending that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've just been using that one parter
and it's been working out good for me.
So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we find, uh, when we are able to soil
test, cause, you know, we do work with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of larger facilities is that over time
we'll start to see things build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if your, uh, you know, particular
cultivar is pulling more, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, for example, then, uh,
another cultivar, um, or the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium you're adding over time,
you would have a magnesium deficiency or
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing goes the other direction
with nitrogen, you know, and the potential
[SPEAKER_00]: for toxicity with too much if the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all about how much is the plant
pulling out, how much is in the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: how much are you adding?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to get those
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, if you're just trying to do
it based off of, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially guessing, but it is,
you know, the nice thing about all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: process is that I should, I probably need
to mention is what we call living soil has
[SPEAKER_00]: a much greater capacity to buffer things
than hydro and other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, even if you're
way off, um, the soil is probably going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why people say like pH doesn't
matter, you know, or I, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to test it in living soils
is, is because of that buffer and
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think that's why you're
having the success that you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get deeper into pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's the next thing up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually did an Instagram video on
this and he had some great information and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of misconceptions, particularly pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it matter in living soil or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was kind of, uh, it was honestly
kind of shocking to me that this was such
[SPEAKER_00]: a controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be honest, I started off on that
sort of organic soil route thinking it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't that important because I never had
to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have really good water, uh, here in the
Seattle area, um, that doesn't have a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of mineral content and, uh, it's fairly
neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my soils that I used were always
within a good pH range, but pH absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take 10 seconds, hop on Google and just
Google pH availability chart for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it's very, very obvious when you
look at that, that there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges when nutrients are going to be more
available for your plant and heavy metals
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be less available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can stay within that optimal
pH range, and for me, um, if we're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants in living soil,
I like to run a little more alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually target around six,
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll go as low as six, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in hydro and other things,
people are down in the fives or low sixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I like to run a little bit
more alkaline because that reduces heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metal uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't necessarily limit a lot of
the nutrient availability and we still get
[SPEAKER_00]: good yields and good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, pH absolutely matters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anyone who's taken a plant botany
course, uh, and understands how plants
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake nutrients, we'll under,
we'll, we'll agree with it's one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things that like soil scientists just
don't argue about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the earth is round yet when we
get into the living soil community,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that's where things get a little bit,
uh, you know, less sure on, on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these just basic plant physiology
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a grower is growing with organic
inputs and their water source comes in at
[SPEAKER_01]: a high pH, let's say seven or even 7.5 or
above, would you recommend that they use
[SPEAKER_01]: like some form of pH down, whether it be
phosphoric acid or one of the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: methods of lowering the pH to that water
prior to doing a soil drench, or would you
[SPEAKER_01]: just recommend them water it in above 7.0
pH or whatever it is above that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, and we see this, I've seen water
tests that are crazy with heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, sodium, with high levels of
calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we, you need to know where your water
is so that you can adjust it to optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you water, if your soil is,
you know, let's just say it's at six,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, and then you're watering with water
that's seven and five, and it's bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: in high levels of sodium over time,
you're going to have, and sodium is not a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant essential nutrient over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have some, um,
issues with high soluble salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, osmotic shock and your plants just not
going to grow as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the plant going to be okay if you water
a few times with seven, three,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven, five water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might make it a cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might make it two cycles, but over
time you're going to have issues if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not accounting for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to take that same water
and you were to pH it down, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant is going to have to work a lot
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not going to work as hard to
access those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not having to work as hard to
access nutrients, it's putting more energy
[SPEAKER_00]: into creating, um, flowers, creating,
you know, creating biomass, all the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want a healthy plant to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just, we're just making it easier
on the plant in a lot of ways and reducing
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk of some of these other,
of some of these other imbalances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a lot of folks are going to,
they're going to say that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're pH adjusting it and you do a
soil drench, you're killing off the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in there because you're using
phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, are microbes being killed
with pH up and pH down solutions?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hear this a lot from what I've
seen, the research I've seen actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, phosphoric acid feeds microbes,
um, in low levels, which is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: should be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your water is that far off that you're
having to use excessively high levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: pH down, then you probably need to be
filtering your water using other means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one thing I will say, if you're using
phosphoric acid, your P availability goes
[SPEAKER_00]: through the roof, which means you're
probably, if you're leaching your soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: as in getting runoff, you're probably
adding phosphates to our water supply,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're already at peak phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, phosphates in our water cause algal
blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cause huge issues with our water
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't recommend using high
levels of phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to use a little bit to lower
your pH, you want to account for that in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of how you're managing your,
your other phosphorus sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably need to reduce those quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're using a lot of phosphoric
acid, you can also use sulfuric acid to
[SPEAKER_00]: lower pH and you can also use citric acid,
but they all have pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, citric acid would be really your only
organic option, but it's not a great
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to add citric acid into a
reservoir, for example, uh, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it in there and then come back
later in the day, your pH probably has
[SPEAKER_00]: gone back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it doesn't have as much of an
impact overall on lowering pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and just this morning, uh,
I saw some more lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen two lab tests now on pH down
products that were causing people to fail
[SPEAKER_00]: in, um, certain states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for heavy metals, specifically,
uh, arsenic in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, if you are a commercial
cultivator, um, check your pH down as
[SPEAKER_00]: another source of, of heavy metal
contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're talking like big time brands in
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these are not like they're using small
uncommon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, if I were to say the brand,
you'd be like, Oh my gosh, that's a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: multimillion dollar company that's been
around forever kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably GH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not going to say what the
brand is, but do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into organic fertilizer
blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they've become more and more
popular over recent years due to their
[SPEAKER_01]: ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the pros and cons to
using these organic blends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm, if I'm growing tomatoes
outdoors, uh, and I want to go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and buy a fertilizer that has a
picture of a tomato on it, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that really simplifies the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the nice thing about growing outdoors
is a lot of those nutrients are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: leach out of the soil in between cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of rain events, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty much starting from scratch
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not going to have excess nitrates
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to have a lot of available
phosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to have a really much
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can, as, as someone who formulates,
uh, fertilizers and nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can feel fairly confident what that
starting point is for most growers from a,
[SPEAKER_00]: from a fertility, from a chemistry
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to dial that in a soil
test is really useful, but if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use a soil test and you're
growing veggies and you want to just add a
[SPEAKER_00]: veggie fertilizer, uh, that's,
it's not a bad way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are paying a premium for that product
because they've mixed it together for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're buying the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and some are going to be higher
quality sources than others, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, yeah, there's certainly nothing wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now indoors where you're not, not leaching
your soil where you're not getting that
[SPEAKER_00]: same level of runoff, you can get that
buildup and, and toxicities are
[SPEAKER_00]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: She challenges over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any blends that you
recommend to use or recommend not to use
[SPEAKER_01]: when growing medicinal plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's so tough just because as someone
who's in that industry, um, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to step on anyone's toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, here, here's what I'll say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were buying, uh, bottled nutrients,
a lot of what you're paying for is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are better options out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of companies, if you're using
chemical nutrients that I personally turn
[SPEAKER_00]: people to is, is beanstalk, uh,
agriculture, which is a lot like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's like Osma code, but it's designed
for medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever seen those little tiny
pebbles that come in your nursery plant at
[SPEAKER_00]: home Depot, they're just slow release
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're chemical fertilizers and
they're going to release nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slowly over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beanstalk makes a product like that,
uh, that you can just put in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant is going to release the
nutrients slowly and it's optimized for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're someone who likes to mix your
nutrients, you're a chemical grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and you want to do this as affordably
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the best company that, that I've seen
out there is Jack's, uh, Dr. Carrie Peters
[SPEAKER_00]: is their chemist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a family business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, they test regularly for heavy
metals and for nutrient quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had her on my podcast, uh,
once I'm actually going to interview her
[SPEAKER_00]: again on Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they've done a ton of tissue testing,
uh, and lab analysis on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, great company.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go chemical nutrients
on the organic side, obviously I love,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love what we're doing at kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put a lot of time and energy into
creating a soil, um, and fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it took me, it takes me about
two years to formulate a soil mix before
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll release it because I really want to
do that research and know it's a good
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one thing I will say, especially for
people who are growing organically and are
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about heavy metals or in a state
where they need to pass for heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_00]: these tests that I'm seeing on social
media do not match the test that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing when we test things independently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so just because someone claims to be
transparent online does not mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: their product quality or their product is
actually what they say it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, just be careful there and test
your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not going to name any names,
um, in that regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are some people that avoid
the blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd rather go the individual amendment
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of your favorite organic
amendments to add to the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe talk to us about what the amendment
is, application rate, when to add,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, that's a whole podcast in of
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's so many amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you go on our website on kiss
organics.com, you can, you can click on
[SPEAKER_00]: any amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say fish meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fish meal is a good nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's going to be fairly available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's the, the size of the molecule
or the size of the product, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: finely ground powder or it's, um,
prilled or a larger pellet is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine how available that plant,
that product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want something that's going to
break down, uh, more, um, break down
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly, then you, you want something that
has a larger surface area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said that backwards, smaller surface
area, the larger the surface areas in the
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller, the more the particle size,
the more available it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but fish meal is a great,
great nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you specifically want to add
nitrogen, you can use fish meal and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go on the website and see the heavy
metal test and see the NPK level that
[SPEAKER_00]: tells you how much nitrogen is in that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so then at that point,
it really comes down to when I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at these different amendments,
it comes down to cost and it comes down
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, what am I paying for that
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at the end of the day, the plant
doesn't care if it gets its nitrate from a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of nutrient, from alfalfa meal,
from fish meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, nitrate is nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some sources are better than others in
the sense of how available they are or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, if they're bringing in other nutrients
or again, I know I've said heavy metals a
[SPEAKER_00]: few times on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they, if they're, if they come with
heavy metals, those are all things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can factor into your, your purchase
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like to play around too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add those individual things,
kind of like a, you know, kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: wizard or a witch trying to like make a
potion sort of thing to maximize my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I like to do it around a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually know that what I'm adding is
what I, what is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I, I do see that where people are
like, okay, there's this hype product
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see online everyone's using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, if, if that product's main main
product is the main thing in it is let's
[SPEAKER_00]: just say phosphorus, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've already got phosphorus
sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I add more phosphorus that could be
causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what Brian talked about now,
my iron may be less available or other,
[SPEAKER_00]: other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's important to keep that in
mind when you start playing around with
[SPEAKER_00]: all these little individual amendments
that they're balanced, that they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, helpful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I think if I were to,
if I were to talk about one, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium and lime, just so we want to talk
about individual amendments really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to calcium, you have,
you have a few different, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of options like fish bone
meal, anything with phosphorus is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring in calcium more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're talking about just limes,
there's a lot of different lines out there
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're kind of confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about agricultural
lime or oyster shell flower, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to raise your pH and that's
important to know too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you're low in calcium,
you have a low pH, this is when you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use agricultural lime or oyster shell
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the amount of trace minerals in
oyster shell flower is so small.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think they want oyster shell cause
it's better than ag lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both mined products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're close enough that you can use
them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whatever's cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other one is dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dolomite lime is going to bring in
it's calcium carbonate and magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a fairly large load of
magnesium that you may or may not want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to use dolomite very
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not balanced properly for plant
health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you were to confuse yourself
and add dolomite, it's going to raise your
[SPEAKER_00]: pH a lot faster and a lot, and a lot
higher than, um, uh, calcium carbonate or
[SPEAKER_00]: ag lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not sure you have a good pH,
you think you need calcium, stick with
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sulfur in the gypsum keeps the keeps
you, um, it buffers the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially it's not going to,
it's not going to really change the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's just where knowing a little
bit about limes can make a huge difference
[SPEAKER_00]: in what you add, uh, to your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about for potassium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there like an amendment that you would
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people will add in some
potassium in flowering, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to help with flower production.
[SPEAKER_01]: What organic amendment is good for
potassium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, as Bryant mentioned,
a lot of people get sufficient potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: from their compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all composts are high in potassium,
but quite a few of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something definitely to be aware
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to keep potassium sulfate on
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's 50% potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very available potassium and it's,
it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a few bucks a pound sort of
price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it allows you to get a lot of
available potassium really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see you have a potassium deficiency
or if your plants just are not,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, if you're just not getting that,
that denseness.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the flower bud that you want,
um, mid to end of cycle, or they're used
[SPEAKER_00]: to seeing it's probably a potassium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where you could start adding
potassium to see if you get that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: response that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, potassium sulfates, uh, you know,
not technically, um, considered completely
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, um, it is approved for use in
organic production if you have a potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's something I like to use for
potassium.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I would say that the products I
like to have on hand, if I'm a,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm a tinkerer and, uh, you know,
I, I know I'm going to be need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: individual nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have agricultural sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say I like to have gypsum on
hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, oh, and, uh, magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Epsom salt, um, because those are all
things that I can use to get calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really quickly in a very available source
at a very affordable price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the egg sulfur is a, is a great
way to lower your pH in your soil over
[SPEAKER_00]: time used in small doses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we're just scratching the
surface here with these, uh, individual
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments and probably could do a whole
episode on this in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might have to invite you back
sometime in the future to now we're in on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, uh, let's get into heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that a few times here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was mentioned, but I want to get deeper
into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly be a concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: What should we know about heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we test for them and how do we
avoid them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heavy metals is sort of something
that's become relatively important in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and relatively new, something
that we weren't really talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, people were sort of indiscriminately
using organic amendments and then states
[SPEAKER_00]: started testing for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we found that there's certain things
are going to be higher in arsenic,
[SPEAKER_00]: cadmium, uh, lead, you know, some of those
major ones that are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, first of all, I want to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one is testing our vegetables right
now for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to me is, is much more of an
issue than what they are doing in testing
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of our industry on the medicinal
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, the other day I was out
buying, I was at the grocery store buying
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes and I was thinking about,
I was like, do I want to buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponically grown tomato?
[SPEAKER_00]: And California that was grown using
chemical nutrients, but probably not a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of pesticides in a hot house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do I want to buy that certified organic
tomato that was grown in Mexico that
[SPEAKER_00]: probably has lax or standards and no one's
testing for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it may have been grown
organically, it may be higher in arsenic
[SPEAKER_00]: or lead or, or cadmium than I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got me thinking about what,
you know, it's a complicated issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, is what I want to say around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of how we manage it in soils,
um, I want to say, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're, we're passing in every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did just have a fail in, in
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just heard back from the grower
today that the pH down was their biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: contributor of heavy metals, but every
organic soil is going to have some level
[SPEAKER_00]: of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every organic fertilizer is going to have
some level of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it all becomes down to management.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we know how much the plant is
taking out and a lot of medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are hyper accumulators of these heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, hemp is used in remediating,
uh, a lot of damaged soils because it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: great at pulling out, um, pulling out
heavy metals and other, and other,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, toxins out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, there's a few things we can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can pull it, we can pull heavy metals
out by planting a crop that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially accumulate these nutrients and
then getting rid of that, that biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that leaf matter, everything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also your stems and your leaves are
going to have higher levels of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals than your, your bud or flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something to keep in mind in
terms of how you trim your plant for
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, what are some other things
to think about here?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, running a higher pH is going to
help with certain heavy metals and then
[SPEAKER_00]: being less available to plants than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that will work too, but really,
um, you need your, the amount that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is taking out of, out of the soil
needs to be less than the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: standard, but higher than what you're
adding to the soil every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that's a little hard to
visualize, um, but, but you just have to
[SPEAKER_00]: think about your inputs, have to be
bringing in less heavy metals than the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is taking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you maintain that,
you'll continue to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but we're talking about parts per
million or in some cases parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is, it is something you have to be
aware of and there's no formula to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, if this soil has 10 PPM of arsenic,
then my plant's going to fail for heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals because how you water, um,
if you're using CO2, what your light
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are, you know, what your VPD is are
all going to be factors in terms of how
[SPEAKER_00]: much heavy metals that plant takes up in
addition to pH and other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, there's no exact science
to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no great way to know, but we can
reduce heavy metals by utilizing products
[SPEAKER_00]: that are lower in heavy metals,
um, and working with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who makes your fertilizer to know that
you, what your product is, is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, there's some,
there's some products out there right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I see on the market that,
um, are very, very popular that are higher
[SPEAKER_00]: in heavy metals than people realize based
on the independent testing we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, one good option for people,
if they want to test themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lab called the Delta Urban Soils
Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think they're, they charge like $15
a sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be as accurate as some
of these other methodologies for testing
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals, but it's an affordable way
to get a test of your garden, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: without breaking the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can also test fertilizers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've, uh, we've been using them just
because of the price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I, I just sent in a sample to
get certified for a new, um, bloom
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer that we're going to be
releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like $250 to get the
heavy metal analysis on it, to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: certified analysis that I can then send to
the state to register my product properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it can be expensive too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is heavy metals more of a concern with
some organic amendments than others,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, the rock phosphate,
is there more likely to have heavy metals
[SPEAKER_01]: in there versus like an alfalfa meal or a
kelp meal and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, though there's no, there's no hard
and fast rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, uh, rock phosphates,
so soft rock phosphate, people have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of Calphos, um, Eden makes a rock
phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all mined products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything mined has the potential to have
heavy metals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so yes, I think in general,
really watch rock phosphates, kelp meal is
[SPEAKER_00]: another one that we see a fair bit of
variability on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned alfalfa meal and that's
a great example here because people think
[SPEAKER_00]: that like all alfalfa meals are going to
be the same, but really it's, is the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that that alfalfa meal was grown in high
and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was, then that alfalfa meal is going
to be higher in heavy metals, but without
[SPEAKER_00]: testing of that particular source,
you're not really going to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and again, alfalfa meal is a tough
one because it may be sourced from a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different places under the same
brand name every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where testing kind of becomes
more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like whatever source you're
going to, to buy that alfalfa meal or kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: meal or whatever, looking for them doing
that testing, looking at that report and
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing if there are heavy metals on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also it sounds like doing your own
individual testing because sometimes those
[SPEAKER_01]: tests, tests aren't going to be accurate
to what the testing that you do on your
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, wow, that's kind of crazy to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a, it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that unfortunately is,
is more complicated than we want it to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same too with nutrient
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I go online and I see these charts
and forums of like NPK levels for various
[SPEAKER_00]: manures, you know, chicken manure,
cow manure for various amendments like
[SPEAKER_00]: fish meal or, you know, anything that has
NPK, those things are just going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: rough guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every product is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the state has done testing on
even the products, like you go buy tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, and it's, let's just say five,
five, five, when they go to test that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it might end up being five, seven,
three, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, there's inconsistency across
product too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very hard to, to, to know
without, again, without testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're actually getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about that a little bit
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your soil added in fertilizer,
but you need those microbes in there in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to break down those amendments and
turn them into usable nutrients for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people are doing the IMO
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going into the backyard and
getting microorganisms that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people are buying products on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What microbial inoculants do you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how often should people be inoculating
their medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of options out there
on the market now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's getting more and more,
more and more crowded with microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them are really, really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some great microbial
inoculants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been using mammoth pee for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another one called microbial mass
that I'm setting up trials with right now
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know the founder of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see how that product
performs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was just talking yesterday with
a guy who's got a microbial organic
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning gel that I'm excited to start
playing around with that they did in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with the university to create
research on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some good products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the microbes out there are coming
out of China and they're just being
[SPEAKER_00]: re-bottled and blended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be good or bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the consistency across microbial
products is something that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: standardized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go on the Oregon Department of
Ag website, you can see that they did some
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and found that the claims on the
labels don't match what's actually in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But things to consider looking into a
researching trichoderma is an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good bacillus products
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think what I would say,
whether you're doing an IMO, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying a product is do a control in
your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe you do half your plants or a
quarter of your plants and then test it
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep all your other variables the same
and see if you get the plant response that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, then maybe you don't need to
be buying that product or maybe your
[SPEAKER_00]: application rate is wrong on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where I think people get in
trouble is they start adding all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different products in or maybe they got a
bunch of samples at a trade show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you really have no idea if any of
these things are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of them may actually be
antagonistic and you're spending money on
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you don't want or don't
need necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are doing IMO, keep in mind that
you do have the potential to be bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: in pathogens into your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be aware of that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the compost tea, same with
anything you're sourcing outside or from
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the risk is relatively low and it's
something that can be managed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just try it on a few plants and see how
it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned several products throughout
this episode and some of the products you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to be weary about because some of them
don't work as intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's marketing there and they sell you
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you evaluate a product for your
garden, cut through the marketing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do whole talks on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing I try and do with any
product is I try and cut through the BS
[SPEAKER_00]: and look at it and say, okay, what are
they actually telling me in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: information?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start throwing around words like
proprietary or confidential, usually that
[SPEAKER_00]: means they're hiding something.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product probably is something pretty
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something necessarily all that
novel or innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I look at is what's
actually in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is on the ingredient list that I
can actually see?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they are guaranteeing an NPK
level, for example, anything that provides
[SPEAKER_00]: NPK has to be listed on the ingredient
list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the company is not registering
their products with states, like as a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, what they're doing is illegal
and there's no oversight and buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I can look through that ingredient
list and say, okay, well, these are all
[SPEAKER_00]: things I can source myself or there's
something unique here in terms of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: it's put together that I really want to
experiment in my garden and then I'll try
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and see if I get the plant response
that I wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something you can look at too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these products that I'm
finding on the market are really just
[SPEAKER_00]: basic things that are overpriced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of molasses based
products on the market right now that are
[SPEAKER_00]: called sweet or bud enhancer or things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you look at the ingredient list and
you're like, okay, really they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: adding some molasses and maybe a little
bit of potassium sulfate in there and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: paying two to 300 times what I need to for
that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just as a general rule, if there's a
picture of a sexy woman on the cover of
[SPEAKER_00]: your bottled nutrient, you're probably
overpaying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to throw that out there
because there are a few companies like
[SPEAKER_00]: that out there that have been around the
industry for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, you got to try
things out in a controlled setting and
[SPEAKER_00]: then determine if that product is worth
spending money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I want to add on that is
like, so one of the examples I use in my
[SPEAKER_00]: PowerPoint is seaweed extract powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can buy seaweed extract powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like zero zero 16,
for example, or you can buy liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liquid seaweed is typically reconstituted
from seaweed extract powder, only you're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying now for them to do that for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can add a quarter to half a
teaspoon per gallon of the extract powder
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and save hundreds of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: On a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good example there where you
can... Eggsil 16H is another one,
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy all these different silica
products or you can just buy potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate in the form of eggsil,
add it to water yourself and save a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some ways to get around
spending a lot of money on products.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another thing I feel like we're
just scratching the surface on and we
[SPEAKER_01]: could probably go way deeper on if we
really wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we are coming up towards the end of
the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here are a couple more things I want to
ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, is there anything else in
regards to reusing soil that you think is
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial for the audience to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you're unsure about the quality
of your soil, pile it up outside,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave it for a few months, let it get
rained on, and then bring it back in and
[SPEAKER_00]: re-amend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or don't bring it back in, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it in your garden outside because it
may have picked up some pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much as if it was just a brand new
soil that didn't have any fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the simplest thing and
easiest solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, all media for the
most part can be reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worst case is you have to leach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, don't throw out your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably my biggest piece of
advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can find us at kisorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also on all social media,
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be working on some more
YouTubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting together an indoor garden as
well as a... I've been getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: houseplants lately, so I'm excited to do
some more stuff around houseplants for
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm currently outside building my
veggie garden so I can shoot some more
[SPEAKER_00]: videos out there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really big on education.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ton of information on our
website and on the blog section as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope folks will come check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to send you a nutrient pack so you
can try out our mix and see how it does
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to chat about that after the
show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm releasing a new Garden Talk
podcast episode and I'd love for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ted, once again, thanks so much for coming
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been insightful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned a lot and I know my audience
is going to be learning a lot with this as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it and I appreciate
your platform and what you do for
[SPEAKER_00]: educating people on growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for your positive words.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
