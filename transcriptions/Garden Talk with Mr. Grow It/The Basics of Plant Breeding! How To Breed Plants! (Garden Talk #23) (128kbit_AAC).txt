[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to get more purple,
then so the first thing you'll do is F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll take a sister and a brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll put them together and that'll be
your F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then F3 on the next sister brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's filial breeding all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sister brother, sister brother,
just straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the word stable when it comes to
saying, seeds are stable, means that they
[SPEAKER_01]: come out like a monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 99% of the traits that they display,
they almost look like clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the progeny, you can get them all down
to being all root or Alice after a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of generations of breeding or a few
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get it down to all of them being
root or Alice, you'll never get the
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll always be recessive against so you
can take a male and stress it out and run
[SPEAKER_01]: it long enough and it will throw female
pistols and flowers and seed itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of your seeds that come from that
male will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody through that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't know me, my name is Chris,
AKA Mr. Growit, and you're tuned into the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: TalkÊºèkate is episode number 23,
In this episode, I interview Vader OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the founder of OceanGrow Genetics
and has been breeding for over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows a variety of plants such as
cucumbers, tomatoes, herbs, orchids,
[SPEAKER_00]: banana trees, fig trees, avocado trees,
citrus trees, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vader also has a YouTube channel where he
has nearly 80,000 subscribers and he's
[SPEAKER_00]: been uploading videos for the past 10
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's definitely an OG on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we talk about the basics
of breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from the nomenclature all the
way to how to make different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am joined with Vader from Ocean Grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super pumped to have you on the podcast
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about breeding,
the basics of breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't think of a better person to
have on the podcast for this discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember watching you in 2014
I think is when I first started watching
[SPEAKER_00]: you and you've been around since 2011 is
when your first video came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yesterday, I think it was June or July
11th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think yesterday was 10 years on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the 10 year anniversary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this, this is like an anniversary
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to call that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 469 videos currently on your
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 80,000 or about to hit 80,000
subscribers and all those videos combined
[SPEAKER_00]: have over 9.2 million views.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's truly incredible, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hats off to you for really doing this for
the past 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's just extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even think about the numbers most
of the time, like the analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know others, even people on the team and
stuff, like really nerd out about the
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sort of look past it and don't think
about it often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you hear the numbers like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, it does sound like a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just really to me, it's just like,
you keep trudging, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's about the same work is
growing or it's the same work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had years where like, yeah,
really active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's other years where,
you know, you take a slow down,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have other things going on in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens and, but we're still here and
I'm happy to still be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've even been through a little
bit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had channels deleted and YouTube
give it back and just really with no
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance from YouTube or anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still happy to be here and putting out
content when we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of changes,
I think for everybody over the years,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even just with life,
but we're still making our way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still cruising through and still plan
on keeping it up for the time being,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as they allow us to keep
performing.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know who you are,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and kind of how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the kind of basic little story
is that when I was a graduate of high
[SPEAKER_01]: school, stuff like that, I joined the
military for different reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of different reasons,
but ended up being the military for a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years, got sick and resulted in
kind of a lung and bronchial issue for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself was PEB, which you call a physical
evaluation board.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they wouldn't allow me to stay because
I was going to take too long to recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't even sure if I would
recover all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pretty sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent on and off a few months in the
hospital at a time and full ICU,
[SPEAKER_01]: very similar to some of the viral issues
that you see people going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time I had gotten something very
similar in the sense of like that resulted
[SPEAKER_01]: in my body then producing pneumonia
symptoms and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't kick the virus that it was
at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got pneumonia over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept relapsing with it and it damaged
and scarred my lungs and my bronchioles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got bronchiectasis and lung scarring
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was pretty down about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And military was like, you're not going to
be coming back right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had gotten all the way down to like
140 pounds at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was going from like 240.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pounds of, you know, having some muscle
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that like in a six month period,
just way down and then couldn't get weight
[SPEAKER_01]: back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I got out of military,
it was about 180 pounds and I'm six,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my average good weight is
205 to 220 at least just to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of slipped below that and I'm a
little too thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still had some work to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they retired me and I didn't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on a bunch of steroids in 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really feeling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had been an athlete my whole life and
wasn't wasn't sure what the next step was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were things like, you know,
medicinal herb that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty popular in the culture around Cali
and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Derivatives of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that fashion, it was offered to me
during the time to think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had always been an athlete and so
I'd always avoided it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Friends and people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Participated at a party here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had had a beer, you know, a few hops and
passed around some of that medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it never really affected me much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, it wasn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never really thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had seen some friends that,
of course, like you get in that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people can abuse things really
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was always in my mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: But got in the military on a bunch of
steroids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doctors didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of mine joked about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little Peter Tosh, Bob Marley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ha ha ha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's asthma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, oh, I'll give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so friend brought some over and tried
it and couldn't believe how incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: just immediately better I felt even for my
lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I had scarring, you know,
you would think that it would be like a no
[SPEAKER_01]: no, especially to consume a product by
inhaling and burning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ended up changing my life around about
the viewpoint of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at that time period, it was really
important, especially for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make sure that I had clean product,
because a lot of people, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: unregulated markets, can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're fighting a lot of weird
pest issues, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people will use products that are
outside of agriculture because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really important to me at the
beginning to be able to produce my own
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned that very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one thing about that time period
was that it was harder to get your medical
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything in Cali at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 96, they had opened it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But 2001, 2002, still really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had to go to like one specific specialty
doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to go through a bunch of stuff,
bring all your records, multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews, ended up getting a card and
ended up being able to also produce in
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali law.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could produce for yourself as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So along with that, I started producing
for myself pretty lightly for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it just kind of grew from that
point on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and I ended up falling in love with
this, not only the plant itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but plants in general, agriculture and all
kinds of medicinal plants that do come
[SPEAKER_01]: along with these concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you break your mind free of like a
stigma of something you've been told,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it makes you realize like,
well, hey, if we were told this about this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, then what other things out there
are there misconceptions for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that started me on a path,
definitely more based in agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: a large part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had mentioned before we
started filming is that you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding for over 15 years now,
is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first few years for sure,
it was just for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just produce product or flowers
and things like that to be able to make
[SPEAKER_01]: different products and try different
avenues to thinking about it, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there are different ways to consume the
products or make different products for it
[SPEAKER_01]: and found what works for me, what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then slowly, though, more friends,
because you're doing a good job of
[SPEAKER_01]: producing product, clean product,
then more people would like some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just ended up sort of growing
that more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I did have the permits and
everything available or started with my
[SPEAKER_01]: card and then kind of worked my way
through the system to see, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, in my county, in my area,
what can we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you bring that up more production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had some friends thought about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had really gotten into the online
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people that know like back from the
overgrown days, that's where I initially
[SPEAKER_01]: started doing seed trading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started because I saw that going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, well, you know, if you're a
farmer, like not only are you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: something, but you also want to breed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also want to try participating in
those future generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot with like the medicinal plant that
we use, you can propagate these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: through cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's super popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was super popular in our community
and in Cali and in that industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we'd quote, unquote, call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still like, you know, you had to
give and get different kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes, different kinds of unique
clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have things that people had
found, but you could also make your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what started me on the
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started small by just using what
they call feminized breeding, where you
[SPEAKER_01]: take a plant and you hermaphrodite it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll use pollen against another
particular strain style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll get something unique out
of those progeny or offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was my original sort of tiptoe in
from maybe 2002 to 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking things, breeding them, finding
clones and then releasing those clones
[SPEAKER_01]: into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And slowly running sort of clone market
business as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't really for like producing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't come until later by being able
to share seeds with other people,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe with friends and of course seed
trading online.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we were all doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still, it's just hemp seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a derivative of the same
species stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there being no cannabinoids,
things like that, that had regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: towards them, especially for like us in
the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that was our way that we could get
around that without having like live
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or live products and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though in our areas it was regulated
and legal, at least on a state or county
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into, let's start with some
of the basic terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, starting with what exactly is
breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to breeding, there's,
you're basically making offspring,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, we've got that with animals and
with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: With animals, it can be a little bit
different, obviously a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: With plants, it's going to be,
I generally call it a little simpler.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could argue theoretically a few
different vantage and viewpoints for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending especially the species.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, it's pretty much simpler in
the sense that for plants you have
[SPEAKER_01]: mono-ecious and dio-ecious or de-ecious,
dio-ecious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of get the, some people say it's
tomato-tomato sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the difference between
plants that have either the, both sex
[SPEAKER_01]: organs on themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So technically they can self-pollinate
themselves, although they generally will
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take like maize, corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is, it tries to have its male parts
and pollen come at a different time than
[SPEAKER_01]: its female parts on its particular plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another corn or maize will be flowering
its female parts at a time at which one
[SPEAKER_01]: near it will be flowering male parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tries not to pollinate itself so
much and then send it off to other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: although technically can pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have both organs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then dio-ecious, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have two different male
and female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now some people get that confused with
like hemp because hemp can show those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually genetically there's,
it's a little bit of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be considered a dio-ecious plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has both males and females,
which was something really interesting for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to learn at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I first learned about it,
I actually thought all plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and especially flowers and things of those
species that are near there, like on the
[SPEAKER_01]: taxonomy when it comes to botany,
were, they all were males and,
[SPEAKER_01]: or male female parts would be on one
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of like the joke at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, it's an alien plant
because, you know, there's true like males
[SPEAKER_01]: and true females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until I learned more about agriculture and
botany, and then it turned out like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh no, you do find this around quite a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, then you get two
separations.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, for us, then we have two
different sets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going for females and males.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the baseline of breeding,
which we call true breeding, or many
[SPEAKER_01]: people refer to as regular, in our
particular industry or community with our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting into, I think it's
appropriate to talk about genotype and
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is something that I had briefly
talked about in a recent past podcast with
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwest J.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We described what it is there,
but I think it's appropriate to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: it here as well in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ken, can you break down genotype and
phenotype for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fenos are going to be what your progeny
persists on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have different phenotypic
expressions per traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genotype itself is the larger genomics
of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and phenotypes are kind of,
we throw it around a lot, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: in like, oh, this is the phenotype of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're really talking about when
you get a progeny and it's a phenotype of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, meaning it's showing a phenotypical
trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say color purple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even though something like color
purple comes from really stress and it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from mutations for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say you're just going for color
and you want something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a progeny that has something
offspring that has purple in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would call it a purple phenotype,
but it's really just displaying that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the whole thing itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually only just the miniature
traits versus the genotype, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing in general for that species,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of taking a step back just to
kind of make things basic for the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners for introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Male plants are going to produce the
pollen sex and are going to release,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pollen sex will open and release
pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Females grow pistils and receive the
pollen through that, ultimately forming a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed within the plant's buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are different generations,
F1, F2, F3, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is an F1?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that nomenclature is when you
take two different kids or two different
[SPEAKER_01]: things in a species and put it together so
it can still breed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's still the same technical
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it gets kind of, it gets a little
different because you talk about like
[SPEAKER_01]: things like animals are easy to show,
like lions and tigers are obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: different, but they're close enough that
they can breed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're at the same time kind of
far enough away from each other that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you breed them together, you get weird
things going on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from sterility to gigantism and
all kinds of funky stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've gotten away, pretty far away,
but they're not super close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you're talking about a species
like for us where we're using our plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're so close that we can move into
different, the same downward spiral is
[SPEAKER_01]: really within the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like humans, like we're all so similar
that you can just mix us like our idea
[SPEAKER_01]: that hair is a certain way or skin or
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're small little changes to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like they might be a wide
variety of stuff, but really genetically
[SPEAKER_01]: we are so similar that these traits are
just well within the same species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where like F1s and things,
I'm talking about just hybridization
[SPEAKER_01]: because all of our plants are hybridized
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can take one that's purple and
one that's green and put them together and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that'll be your F1 on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your F2s, your F3s, traits down,
these are filial breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally what you're gonna do is an
offspring and progeny, you'll take like
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have two parents and then if you,
F1s are gonna be two separate parents,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: From two different zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're on two different sides of
the valley, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been developing far enough away
from each other, but they're like two
[SPEAKER_01]: different tribes.
[SPEAKER_01]: North side and south side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the F1, north and south side
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then their progeny, their offspring,
if you take a brother and a sister and you
[SPEAKER_01]: breed them together because north side and
south side had two different traits,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, purple and green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, and you wanna get more purple then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing you'll do is F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll take a sister and a brother,
you'll put them together and that'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: your F2 and then F3 on the next sister
brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's filial breeding all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sister brother, sister brother,
just straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually you can back yourself in the
corners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally with like hemp and stuff,
it's pretty well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get to like F16 somewhere F12 to F16
and generally you'll get to sterility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably some funky genetic traits,
weird growth patterns, all kinds of stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in between there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can only go so far without F1ing
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning taking something out of that
lineup and resetting it back to something
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back crosses would be back crossing to,
if we move into that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is really popular and that's where
it's much quicker to get to a trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can easily back cross by meaning
you did an F1 and then you got something
[SPEAKER_01]: purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the North original parent lineage was
also purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take a purple child and you back
cross that to the purple parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll take a purple grand kid
and change that back to the original
[SPEAKER_01]: parent again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you get down to like BX4 where
you're like four generations down,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you still keep going back up to your
original parent, which was your zero or
[SPEAKER_01]: your P1s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you'll get into like back
crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get into self-crossing,
which is because with like hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, even though it has males and
females, it has, we have been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed it and it was showing it in nature
and naturally where it will throw both
[SPEAKER_01]: male and female parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the, or this happens with
both plant styles, even mono-ecious or
[SPEAKER_01]: dioecious, that when you self,
the pollen from itself adds in extra
[SPEAKER_01]: chromosomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where you get like X or Y,
XX, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when you get your future progeny,
they're not what we call true breed,
[SPEAKER_01]: where they'll just have XY and XX,
which is why it can get a little confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: when people go to test for sex with the
sex testing, because the sex tests check
[SPEAKER_01]: for Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could say like, oh, this is a Y,
it's a male, but it might actually be a Y,
[SPEAKER_01]: XX, right, or XXY.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're catching the Y thinking it's
male, but really it's going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you grew it out, it would look female.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't give it any stress,
it wouldn't show any of its like
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't, it wouldn't show its selfing
traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just something to think about
that chromosomes and those things aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: all equal in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes like very advanced,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Concepts and things get a little,
so without digressing into weird
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretical or other concepts,
just keeping it simple, getting into
[SPEAKER_01]: selfing S1, S2 can be really viable in a
lot of situations and help hybridize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's another technique that you can use
in speed against filial crossing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which always takes much longer to pull the
traits out, especially when two things are
[SPEAKER_01]: vastly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take something like a plant that
was from equatorial zone, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in Columbia, and then you want to go breed
that against something that was natural in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, very close in the species,
but it was over in Northern Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's going to be far more hybridized,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your progeny are going to be way more
varied, where if you take something from
[SPEAKER_01]: equatorial Columbia, and then you take
something that was over in Peru and you
[SPEAKER_01]: put those together, they're going to be
much closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to call them an F1 when
you breed them together, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily mean that they're not going to
be so similar because maybe they had had
[SPEAKER_01]: some crossing back and forth between the
days earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be much more stable in a sense,
as far as like a monoculture crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll still call them F1s and F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something to think about when
people hear like, oh, this is an F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to stay away from those,
or this is an F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, something that's so hybridized
nowadays, especially in our industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: community, most of the time we've
hybridized everything so much that when we
[SPEAKER_01]: have one thing, there's still so many
traits that are similar that they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to work well together and you may not see
as much variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just have to get to know your
breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why, you know, in the 70s,
80s, there was a lot more varied
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the years, of course,
we're all just interacting with each other
[SPEAKER_01]: and passing around plants and genetics
that we've really come to a place where
[SPEAKER_01]: we've gotten away from a lot of those
extreme.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't find those as much anymore
because the production has moved itself
[SPEAKER_01]: all around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the record, I am not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did create a cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did brisker OG cross with Pakistan
Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you are a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm learning so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this conversation here, you know,
the short 20 minutes that we've already
[SPEAKER_00]: been recording, I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't consider myself a breeder at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you consider me a breeder,
I'm a breeder with barely any experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, experience levels, but same with
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure that somewhere in here,
somebody who has, you know, a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: level of education will catch me on saying
things that, right, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're always going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even myself, like, I'm pretty well up with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can handle it with the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have friends who are Ph.D.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can hang with them and know a lot of
concepts, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't always get the terms and
everything right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's important to note.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even for someone like you,
as you're getting into it, don't get hung
[SPEAKER_01]: up on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you kind of messed up on a term or
something or even a concept, as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: you have the baseline of it, like that's a
great beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn from new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even I myself learn all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but you're on that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is well to call yourself if you've
started breeding, then you're a breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: like that's to me, that's the same place
you're participating in something that
[SPEAKER_01]: most people don't participate when it
comes to plants and farming just in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's hop into the selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, oftentimes breeders,
they're going to select certain males or
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with males.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at certain characteristics in
the plant, things that they're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for, that they want to breed within that
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about the male selection
process, what are some characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: that you look for when you're selecting
males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when it comes to these kinds of
things, I've always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of depends on where whether you
know your your particular strains or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in one species of a plant,
once you know your strains more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make a variety of decisions based
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But always starting really simply,
like just in a basic level, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always lean into recommending that you
go for help, go for the health of the
[SPEAKER_01]: males and you don't worry about trying to
get into the nitty gritty of figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: what traits are going to pass on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be able to tell that,
especially like in our field with the
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the more prized possession.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what people are going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you concentrate more on what the
females are displaying and not what the
[SPEAKER_01]: males are displaying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you're going to get into is
dominant and recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could pick a male, for example,
that is showing purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you breed it with a female that
has purple green and then all the progeny
[SPEAKER_01]: just turn out green.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is because there is a dominant trait,
right, that is going to grasp on and be it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in ones and twos or zeros and ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that dominant trait is going to
overtake the recessive trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll run into that all the time with
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is why I say at the beginning,
you worry about health of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that strength and stay away
from worrying about the traits themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: as much when it comes to the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The females are much easier to identify
the traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you breed with them,
you'll be able to then try to keep picking
[SPEAKER_01]: those females that display those traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, of course, you can start doing with
the males themselves, colors, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for hemp and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to like trichomes and stuff
and production, then that will lend itself
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you start picking purple males that are
real sticky, right, and you want stickier
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers on your females, it's going to
lend itself over and you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: more dominant traits for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always say get to know your plants
first before worrying about the specific
[SPEAKER_01]: traits because of those dominant recessive
genes are going to be more powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to find the visualization
of being able to choose that and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding your plants under females
much quicker and easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Males are a little harder to kind of wrap
your brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't deal with them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will display different traits
depending on what strain line they come
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that from experience that
certain strain lines, I'm not worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about if a male's tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a recessive trait with the
particular females I'm running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always I don't care if he gets
super lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really bother me that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't want it extremely lanky,
but it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will pick a linkier male that is purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over a male that like, oh, I don't want it
getting too lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get it a little bit more green
because I just don't want to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: height down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of that artistry experience
that comes in play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the hard part about time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then time comes into play and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shooting for males that are healthy,
strong, that's the best way to go at
[SPEAKER_01]: first, because that will always bring up
the health and vigor of all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and all the progeny from that
point on, even with females.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we hybridize stuff so much and so
many people in the industry end up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds from stressed out situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things didn't go just perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're bringing against clones that
have been around a long time and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly had epigenetic drift, as we call
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So epigenetic wise, they've been exposed
to different environments and different
[SPEAKER_01]: stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has changed their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like the twin, even with humans,
you take two twins and one of them grows
[SPEAKER_01]: up well, super healthy, and the other one
is malnourished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing up, you're going to get that
particular exact clone, in a sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: that identical twin, to one, be displaying
different traits even later on in their
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have displayed either trait of
being a little hunched back or being
[SPEAKER_01]: standing up straight, for example,
but due to those stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to clones, a lot of
times, and even seed batches as people are
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, we sort of end up defaulting down
into things not being as healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the easiest ways to bring up
the health of stuff is just to pick for
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier plants in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that kind of makes sense in that
realm, I just say start soft, start
[SPEAKER_01]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I first grew out of male,
I was really surprised by not only how
[SPEAKER_00]: fast those pollen stacks grew,
but how fast they opened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it was around day 20 or
something, pollen stacks were opening up
[SPEAKER_00]: and pollen was going everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around what day of flower do you feel it's
best to kind of harvest pollen or collect
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from males in order to kind of
maximize the amount of pollen you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some people are there,
you know, let me back up a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some people that are actually
collecting the pollen, storing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and using it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some people who are just
putting a male in with a female and
[SPEAKER_00]: shaking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as like people who are
collecting it, what day of flower is best
[SPEAKER_00]: do you think to kind of harvest that
pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, there's no difference
between pollen that's just being released
[SPEAKER_01]: and pollen that's on a male that's been
opening pollen up for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The viability and strength of that pollen,
the genetics that they're passing on is
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just doing it at different rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're growing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first stamens are coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're starting to drop pollen for the
males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The wind, I mean, you know, with like
hemp, for example, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even need a pollinator like bees or
anything like that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you know, the wind will just
take care of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a chamber or something,
that'll just all on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get off in an environment and the females
will grab it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're collecting, then you don't have
to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just do it right at the beginning,
get enough pollen and you can nuke that
[SPEAKER_01]: male and you don't have to keep it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to waste time on it or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're just doing pollen collection,
then yeah, collect as much as you need
[SPEAKER_01]: right at the beginning and then you can
move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will not change the strength or any of
the traits by letting the male go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to keep producing
pollen to get more females because plants
[SPEAKER_01]: grow at different rates, especially in
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants know they're like,
hey, you know, they drop males,
[SPEAKER_01]: drop pollen from, you know, they start
opening up every two or three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, usually by week three,
males are totally blooming and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to bloom until week five or
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're just, they'll almost die
off themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like after they've spent, males are just
like, bruh, and then they're down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't even see them last, which is why
we usually say, even if you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: chambers or something, you can cut off
your males.
[SPEAKER_01]: After week five or week six and not even
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once the males are cut out of the
situation, then the females will put a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more production and okay, not getting any
more male pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now I'm really going to put that
production into the seeds and the embryos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as like collecting the
collecting process, I've done it a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I put a bag over the actual branch
and shook it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the palm gets collected in a bag,
um, you know, cutting it off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bashing it down onto like tin foil and
then scraping it up is another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using one of those like trim trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that has a screen on it,
bashing it down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the pollen comes down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that to be kind of the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What techniques do you use to collect
pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your biggest thing for collecting
pollen cause pollen is going to go inert
[SPEAKER_01]: really quickly if it dries up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's one thing to note also with
males just as like a side tangent,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like, if you have a male,
um, and it dries up or the pollen dries
[SPEAKER_01]: up, it's going to go inert within like 72
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it dries, it'll be dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the little yellow pollen
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on the edges, but if it's dried
up and gone, it's gone and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it won't be pollinating anything else
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to throw that into a cool
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, guessing you, you either did fridge or
freeze, um, the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in the fridge and I was,
I was, another question I was going to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: you is the best way to store pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, cooling it down and keeping the
moisture level, it's basically what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on with the fridge and cooling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll, you'll get six months or
so out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, often, um, getting into longer period
of freezing, then you need to freeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then um, normal fridges work okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, you're lucky to get a year,
year and a half out of that pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you'll need to get into like minus 80
environments, um, to be able to store
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen for longer periods of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, anytime you freeze it,
because we all know this water expands,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, just like a human being or,
you know, you put ice, you put water in a
[SPEAKER_01]: glass inside your freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ice expands, breaks the glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same things happen with cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to dethaw stuff,
um, if it wasn't frozen quickly,
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, it can actually like the expansion
will, will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go to dethaw, it will create
more problems with moisture and damage the
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the dethaw process that ends up
being hard, which is why, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to be able to kind of move
into a similar round, like on the next
[SPEAKER_01]: round, you know, you're going to use that
pollen on the next round, but you just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to save it for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then just throwing it in the fridge is
generally a better idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you want to do for
oxygen, uh, oxygenization or oxidization
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything is that you want to get the
air out as much air and getting out
[SPEAKER_01]: enough, um, particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you're saying, um, putting it over
a screen and just getting the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: itself and keeping out a lot of the
larger, um, cell structure, the stamens
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, leaf matter and things like
that is going to help in that storage
[SPEAKER_01]: process without inviting any other,
because there's moles and fun guys and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like that floating around,
bacteria floating around and those
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and everything and, and fun guys
will eat away and start, um, in the dethaw
[SPEAKER_01]: process or even inside the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to cool it down enough where
you don't promote that kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, warmer situation where you'll get like
fun guys and things to grow and keep it
[SPEAKER_01]: nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So screening it, um, getting it into a
container of some kind and then getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the air out, which is why I'm more of a
fan of, yeah, whether you get it onto a
[SPEAKER_01]: plate or tin foil, like you were saying,
or whatever different techniques are,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you kind of shake some and you scoop
it up a little spoon, get it into,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put it into vials, things like
that, but it's harder to get the oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: out where with like a little baggie,
you can, if you store them in bags,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can even just kind of press the air
out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just get most of the air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that will help with long-term
storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting the air out and then keeping
the natural moisture level it was at
[SPEAKER_01]: cooled down, then you're going to create a
good environment for that pollen to stay
[SPEAKER_01]: moist enough where it's viable,
but, um, doesn't degrade and doesn't also
[SPEAKER_01]: get eaten away at some kind of pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the female selection
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said it was a little bit different
of a process when you're selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: females.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you select females?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the nice thing about females is that
you kind of like, and I still lend myself
[SPEAKER_01]: away and again, different people can have
different techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: I encourage people to have different
techniques, um, for what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just cause I do something a certain
way, um, doesn't mean it's the right way
[SPEAKER_01]: to go about it or do it because I'm have
such a heavy background in creating
[SPEAKER_01]: clones, um, trying to find specific traits
that are expressed and finding unique
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I will hunt or what we call pheno
hunting, pheno hunt out females,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then use those as my base line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, whether I get into filial breeding or
I just use back crossing quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that work lends itself really well
for like our particularly medicinal style
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp or hemp breeding and stuff that,
uh, yeah, for females, I generally go to
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt for, you know, what I would want to
run as a mono crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find something that would be great to
run just as propagation for clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you clone a bunch and then you run all
whole tray or a whole room just in that
[SPEAKER_01]: one crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll find things that I, to me are
something I would love to grow in larger
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll take that as our baseline
and then use that either for filial
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing, um, F1 style crossing and
hybridization, or we'll use it for back
[SPEAKER_01]: crossing into future generations to try
and see stabilize those traits into being
[SPEAKER_01]: when you grow the seeds out hopeful or
eventually if you get it right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get those seeds to basically what
they call stable and not to be confused
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the terminology, a lot of people
are like, Oh, they're stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like as if they're stable against
hermaphroditic traits, which is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be stable against hermaphroditic
traits, but the word stable when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to saying seeds are stable means that they
come out like a mono culture that 99% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the traits that they display that the
girls are displaying.
[SPEAKER_01]: They almost look like clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be stability or true stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting closer to stability and a
lot quicker with back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start with some baseline thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you just, you're back
crossing to those, you'll end up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: down as long as you don't run into some
weird odd mutation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and everything's pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can get those seeds by BX4,
BX5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's some nuances in there and some
things that we do see depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: back cross generation it is and depends on
the particular strain line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually by BX6 or so, you should have
a pretty stable run of just seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so now you have seeds in the
same way you could produce just those
[SPEAKER_01]: clones by propagating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nice thing about seeds,
unlike clones is that seeds can stay
[SPEAKER_01]: viable for years without, with,
with just some decent storage and still
[SPEAKER_01]: get perfect propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, then it just kind of depends on,
you know, what way in agriculture do you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to hold mom's clones or seeds,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes to the, the actual
pollination process, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're, if you're trying to
pollinate a female too early, you could
[SPEAKER_00]: mess things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too late, you could kind of mess
things up as far as like your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: yield on seeds or however you want to say
it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What day of flower would you suggest?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what do you think is like the
best day to pollinate?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a big believer in nature and for
how many seeds the plants produce for the
[SPEAKER_01]: average person going into this,
you are going to get so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you should never really worry about
trying to do what we call seed production
[SPEAKER_01]: runs where you'll purposely grow the
females out till like week three before
[SPEAKER_01]: even setting a male into flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, by the time the male opens up
and starts producing pollen at his week
[SPEAKER_01]: three, the females are say a week six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that a six week old female
is going to have a lot more flower sites,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more pistils, a lot more calyx sites
to be able to absorb pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be able to get more
seed out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, one, it depends on the strain and
two, it's kind of negligible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are so many seeds that it's
not really that much more production to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be something I would
talk to when it comes to production for
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, when facilities are trying to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were counseling that, then we
could start eating the nuance with
[SPEAKER_01]: particular strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even when you're first breeding and
you just want to keep things natural,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, back to the healthy and strong
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put males in with the females,
they know that they are sending out
[SPEAKER_01]: signals to each other, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're picking that up and the females
will grow just with a male in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vicinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will see them grow slightly
differently because they know that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a male there and they are bumping
themselves up, getting ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other way is that they will they want
to get seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll start putting out and we
can smell it in terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The females will start putting a lot of
production into like trying to basically
[SPEAKER_01]: be sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, to me, lends itself more to like
they want to get seeds in and you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find healthier, better phenotypes
from females that like had a male and they
[SPEAKER_01]: were ready to go right at the same time
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in nature, the males are going to
grow in a field with the females randomly
[SPEAKER_01]: or in the same environment under the same
lighting system, lighting times or photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period times, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to get the same basic
signals from those environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions to start up their production on
whether or not they're going to be getting
[SPEAKER_01]: seed or not getting seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it stresses out the females a
little bit more when you hold that back
[SPEAKER_01]: from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fine when we're just using the
female flower product and that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're getting it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it for a specific thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've bred them to have these big fat
flowers, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or same with cucumbers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we've bred them to get real big and not
have any seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bananas, examples, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to look past like what
we've done for breeding and what not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's really stressing the plant out
and overall, that is a stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting the males in early when you're
just trying to find the best things is
[SPEAKER_01]: always my recommendation is what I go for
is just let the males get in there
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally because the females are still
going to produce more than enough seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when you're doing production on a
personal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also logistically, it just makes
it much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything kind of lines itself up to
just get the males in with the females and
[SPEAKER_01]: let them have a party.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you about yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, generally speaking, I mean,
you can you can veg a plant out,
[SPEAKER_00]: fill up like a four by four space and then
pollinate that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot more seeds than you would a
smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of generally speaking,
you know, do you have a recommended size
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to pollinate and like roughly how
many seeds can potentially yield it from
[SPEAKER_00]: that size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, strains or as you're kind of like
pointing like strains are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how big they are different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like female just when you're
even going for flower production for that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thing with like total sense of me
and no seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going different strains are going
to lend themselves to different training
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, with breeding, you start
getting a male into something like a
[SPEAKER_01]: chamber, then you're not going to be able
to train them out as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get to a point where if
they're locked in a chamber, you can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and like strip down certain
families and still try and promote certain
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a little bit more
difficult challenge unless you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the called pollen collection, going to do
bagging of certain branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then, if you're doing that kind
of technique, well, you're not going for
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to get enough seed
variety out that you can go and experiment
[SPEAKER_01]: and find some different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So becoming more and more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have regular seeds, which can be they
can end up being a male plant or a female
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have feminized seeds, which are
supposed to be always female.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what happened, but they're supposed
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would they're supposed to be
displaying just their female traits?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's what they're attempting to
do is get them there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp itself has a natural mutation
somewhere along the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know exactly where, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been going in and out of
production for hemp for thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are things that like in the 60s
and 70s when all the hippies went out and
[SPEAKER_01]: found all the crazy stuff that was still
out and around or near farms and Vietnam
[SPEAKER_01]: or somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of them were wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they weren't really wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we look back in the genetics of these
plants, we can tell that they had gone
[SPEAKER_01]: through some kind of selection process and
humans were involved in moving them
[SPEAKER_01]: towards different kinds of traits in those
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a crop that we have had our hands
in for a long time, even when it has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: back to wild this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do display these traits of what we
call hermaphrodite traits, where they will
[SPEAKER_01]: just like plants that just have male and
female parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll kind of do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can basically leverage that trait,
this hermaphroditic trait, to and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: where we get into even those females,
though, will still have chromosomes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are displaying both X, X, Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both an X and a Y chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why if you give them a little bit
of a stress, they're much more likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: show those traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even the males and females that you
get in true breeding still have this
[SPEAKER_01]: stress trait in their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most likely from the nature we can
imagine, you get to the fall time of
[SPEAKER_01]: females there, self-preservation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no males to pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end, it'll pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frost is coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll throw out some male sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollen will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll pollinate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least it'll keep that thing going
into the next year, the next season after
[SPEAKER_01]: the frost or whatever it is, wherever that
environment is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we can theoretically
imagine that that's where that trait comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to leverage that trait
by then producing plants that will only
[SPEAKER_01]: show female flowers, a trait for only
displaying female flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we get into the feminized
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it works that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works great if you're super healthy
and you're super good about your
[SPEAKER_01]: selection, then you can absolutely
feminize, as we call it, like this
[SPEAKER_01]: branding term, into seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, a lot of people and a lot
of breeders and places just don't take the
[SPEAKER_01]: time to, one, make the proper selection to
get down to make sure that they're stress
[SPEAKER_01]: tested, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the reasons I stay away from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of that for phenohunting,
to go find strains out of clones and to
[SPEAKER_01]: make clones, because you can find a clone
out of feminized seeds that has all the
[SPEAKER_01]: traits you want, doesn't show the
hermaphroditic traits, is really strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's easy to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to go that far down in fem
breeding to find good clones and then be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to then maybe add some males back in
there, re-hybridize out the genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get it reset, but still grab those
traits that are dominant mostly for those
[SPEAKER_01]: particular strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other places, though, if you give them
the stress, people may see like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, in their environment, they smashed,
you know, two females together and one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they hermaphrodited for feminized
seeds, made fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their environment, it seemed fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't get any hermaphrodite traits,
but then tons of people are reporting back
[SPEAKER_01]: that they share those seeds with,
that they're having issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where you run into this
issue over and over again, where sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: people love fem seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never have any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good breeding was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great selection was done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in other places, it wasn't,
maybe even good selection was done,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in their environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to really expose them to a lot
of different environments to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out whether or not those traits
will be expressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where for myself, yeah, I stick to a lot
of true breeding because even if those are
[SPEAKER_01]: in strains that we use, those kinds of
traits, they definitely aren't displayed
[SPEAKER_01]: as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to be healthier and be able
to get through a lot more stressful
[SPEAKER_01]: situations by having the variety in that
genetics, especially with the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: excuse me, the way that we've hybridized
the entire species itself so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you touched on how feminized seeds are
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otto flowers, another popular type of seed
or plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are those seeds created?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Otto flowers come from part of the
species, the taxonomy for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, that is a ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is related to hemp or is hemp,
but it is started going off in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: path, like a lion and a tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're farther away from each other
versus like, if you go and look at lions
[SPEAKER_01]: or even killer whales, like for example,
there's two different kinds of killer
[SPEAKER_01]: whales.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the Northern hemisphere ones
that hang out and then there's the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: hemisphere ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to us by eye, you might not notice a
difference, but actually if you study
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they've sort of started to bridge
away from each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is smaller than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: One have a little bit different social
interactions, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not totally different with
something they can't breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same with lions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like lions can be that way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think like all lions are the same,
but actually there's some different,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the zones and where they are,
like in say Africa, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: where lions are in different places,
environments, they've gone away from each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, but you take those lions back
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll, they're still lions versus
tiger, which is all the way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at like Ruderalis is like a
tiger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sort of, you get into breeding that
with what we've made selection for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for so long on our production that we've
had a lot of hand in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going back to something that has a
slightly different genetic makeup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now auto flowers are in zones and they
were pulled in a place where they will
[SPEAKER_01]: flower automatically, regardless of your
photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photo period doesn't affect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes along with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the advantage of that,
of course, is that if you pop a seed,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will vegetate itself up no matter the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could give it 24 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll do that for three, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll just start flowering and
you can leave it on 24 hours of light and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll keep flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a great trait for somebody to
be able to just, you know, throw a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in their backyard or on a porch or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue with this is that it's really
hard to get, again, we're back to dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: and recessive traits, to be able to pull
in the traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the progeny or the offspring,
you breed with it with a Ruderalis male,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, this is just, you know,
it could be a female or male, but we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just say a Ruderalis male and you take it
against your favorite at home medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those progeny are going to come
out Ruderalis or auto flower and some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the progeny won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will depend on what's dominant or
recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some of the traits with a particular
strain, maybe a bunch of them come out
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis and a bunch of them don't come
out Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you have to do the
breeding to get it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience with Ruderalis,
because of the genetics and the way it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been worked, it's really tough to get like
flavor profiles, color, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, because that you want,
that you love out of your photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: plant into an auto flower plant because
the dominant traits for auto flower may
[SPEAKER_01]: always go against it being purple,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure, all the progeny, you can get them
all down to being all Ruderalis after a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of generations of breeding or a few
generations, but to get it down to all
[SPEAKER_01]: them being Ruderalis, you'll never get the
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll always be recessive against.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just one example of something
that you could and will run into when
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus if you do feminized seeds and you
self something or self it against another
[SPEAKER_01]: or at least put female male hermaphrodite
pollen onto a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those seeds are going to be that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's much easier to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see that with feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not like with feminized seeds,
some of them turn out to be male and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of them turn out to be feeble.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, they're all going to majority wise
show that female trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to Ruderalis,
you're talking about something completely
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you really have to worry about the
recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indomitable genes to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you get that battle where
some people are like, oh, I ordered
[SPEAKER_01]: Ruderalis seeds and like some a couple of
them were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of them weren't even that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wouldn't they're not photo.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just regular photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because the work wasn't done to
make sure that you got those traits along
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to stabilizing a particular
strain, which is going to be much more
[SPEAKER_01]: important when doing auto flowering and
auto flower breeding to stabilize
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, especially for that particular
trait, because that's the trait you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to ask you, you know,
there's more and more people reaching out
[SPEAKER_00]: to me saying that they got autos,
but they're not actually autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to be the same breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, number one, I won't expose anybody
in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, a lot of these home
growers, they just have one space to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've got a plant that's not
actually an auto and you need to flip it
[SPEAKER_00]: to 1212, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a lot of people that just
they're stuck at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you touched on how that can
actually happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, you know, the not
stabilizing and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's sad to see some of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: People kind of see like things are rushed
in a sense, just to get it out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that and that's the age old
problem even before Ruderalis auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: had become very popular over the last
years, 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really taken off.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get with feminized seeds where people
get complaints like, oh, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's hermaphroditing at week six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even make it past week six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly it's showing its trait
that normally would show at week 12 or
[SPEAKER_01]: something in like a normal true female.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would still throw that hermaphroditic
trait show to try and self-pulling itself
[SPEAKER_01]: under stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead it's overtaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can't even get past week six
with those progeny without it flipping
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also kind of a fun note about
plants, just so some people just to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of get in your idea in your head,
when it comes to true breed, you can also
[SPEAKER_01]: do this to males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take a male and stress it out
and run it long enough and it will throw
[SPEAKER_01]: female pistols and flowers and seed
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of your seeds that come from that
male will be male-ized.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will majority show the male trait and
come out as males, but then they'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing female pistols and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see that in your males and
everything, then you know like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, this somewhere along the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of ended up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happens with tons of strains I've
run across because I too standing on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shoulders of giants and working with gear,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even if it was a long time ago,
at some point I started with gear that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have no idea what the history is of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm told to certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can try and look it up from the names
and from where it comes from in that time
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you never quite know where along the
past something happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of a fun, weird thing
about like feminized breeding is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: also goes the other way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can go on and on and on and on,
but we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us how the listeners can find
you and what you've got upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We run, I have run a company called Ocean
Grown for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best way to find us is we either run
on our Discord or you can just go to our
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's purely educational site.
[SPEAKER_01]: No issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find information about where to
find different kinds of products or what
[SPEAKER_01]: the available producers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have a YouTube channel
that I've been running, as we mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just Vader OG or you can type in
Vader Vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the show that I run
through that production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over on YouTube, you can find me there
and some resource videos available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you want to talk to us or even
get a hold of me a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have questions about things in the
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our Discord has been I used to be big on
forums, so I loved forums and that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: you used to be able to find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've gone away from that with the
newer technology into a much more simpler
[SPEAKER_01]: platform that allows a lot more access.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if you can't just talk to me,
you can talk to people in the team that
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be able to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over at our Discord, Ocean Grown
Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also you've got a podcast that
you're a part of now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk a little bit about that
Growers Workshop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we've started running a podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for Growers Workshop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to get the community together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have a show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So GoTube, a lot of people know and that
was great to be able to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people in our particular community
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is still there to a degree,
although we've kind of stepped away from
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some issues with YouTube and
banning channels and deleting things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time around, very similarly,
we have created a podcast where we can
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about these subjects, but keep them
available for information that YouTube is
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to remove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tried to start this podcast where we
can still talk a little bit more openly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with the right nomenclature,
the right language to express the
[SPEAKER_01]: information out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Growers Workshop is the podcast we've
been running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there is some idea and plans for
also that's where we've been putting like
[SPEAKER_01]: build out stuff, chamber things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who want to like be able to
do breeding and you want to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a chamber area that is going to be
good enough not to let pollen out and
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate, you know, some females and
stuff right nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this can work for orchids and all
kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these that is a great place also to
find that kind of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's less it's more grow wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with I do do like permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do do hydroponics outdoors for veggies,
for all kinds of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of stuff is also a resource
for those looking to do that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's slowly building.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go over there and it doesn't
feel like there's too much information,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're new venture that we're working
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link Vader's channel down in the
description section below and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers Workshop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that channel down in the
description section below.

I release a new episode unless Susan
[SPEAKER_00]: decides she needs to manually review it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then she then it usually comes out on
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically every weekend we have a new
episode out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apple podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're listening on there, please leave
a rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 79 so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting real close to 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everyone who has left a
rating or review on Apple podcasts so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lastly, sharing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sharing this is probably one of the best
things that you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reddit is a big area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of Facebook groups that
you can share it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everyone who shares this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vader, thank you so much for coming onto
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truly been an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so thankful for you to come on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Dago.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one who kind of connected us to
make this happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, and for anyone listening,
drop questions on whatever platform you're
[SPEAKER_01]: watching it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I will rotate back through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get into more detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can even be prepared with some research
if somebody brings up something
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretical or just something that they
want to know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really tough in these kinds of
podcasts to keep it within an hour or 45
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes because I can tangent really quick
into other kinds of concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping that kind of baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully we knocked out the beginner
stuff, but absolutely get down in there
[SPEAKER_01]: and ask away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will definitely rotate back through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a wonderful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Vader, thanks again and hope you
enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll see you soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
