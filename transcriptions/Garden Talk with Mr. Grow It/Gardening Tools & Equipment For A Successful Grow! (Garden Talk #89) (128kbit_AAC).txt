[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grow tent is like your house for your
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something really solid,
you want something reliable, you want
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not going to fall apart
in the middle of your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, the AC Infinity fans with the
speed controller are kind of a no-brainer
[SPEAKER_01]: just because the speed controller is so
huge as far as keeping the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: nice, getting your, you know, humidity in
check.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will alert you if there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has saved my butt a number of times
from some from some problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're buying something that's going to
last you, you know, maybe a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of electrical bills,
you know, so spending a little bit more to
[SPEAKER_01]: have something so your bills a little
lower every month will pay off in the long
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's places to go cheap and then
there's places to invest is how I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lighting and environment are two
places where it's worth spending a little
[SPEAKER_01]: extra money to get efficiency,
quality, and get the kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: performance you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast, this episode
number 89.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Supe the
Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 12 years and
many of you know him from the Dude Grows
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a big contributor over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: His main focus is helping new growers get
started with their first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, I figured we'd talk
about some of the tools and equipment that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use for successful grow.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Soup the Gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you decided to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had a request from,
I think it was Discord, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody like connected us on Discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you need to bring him on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'd love to have him on because
I heard so much about you from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Dude Grow show in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have a ton of knowledge and
I'm just super excited to extract some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that knowledge from you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to hang with you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love that Discord community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love my Discord crew over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The DGC, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those people love hanging out with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So was super excited when I saw they
recommended me to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, heck yeah, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to get into talking
about gardening tools and equipment for a
[SPEAKER_00]: successful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can either just get the bare bone
basics and budget as much as possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to not spend money, save money,
or you can ball out and spend money to get
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment to optimize and or automate
things in your garden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we'll touch on a bit of both in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, before we get deep into the
topic, what I like to do with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: guests is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I first got into gardening a little over
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started having digestive problems and I
found medicinal plants really helped me
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, and learning to grow my own
and also just the therapy of growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, learning to spend time in the
garden, connecting with plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: connecting with nature, you know,
really made a big impact on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I love sharing that with other
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a big focus of my life has been
trying to share that excitement about
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plants with as many people as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love helping people get started,
love people, helping people start new
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens and yeah, just love gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that your main focus is on
helping new gardeners get started with
[SPEAKER_00]: their first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I thought this topic would
be perfect because I get a lot of new
[SPEAKER_00]: gardeners reaching out to me and asking
about equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different pieces of
equipment, particularly when growing
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, that you need to get in order for
the plants to grow at a good rate and be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful with the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of going through the different
pieces of equipment, I don't think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get touch on every single thing,
but I think we can get a good chunk of it
[SPEAKER_00]: done today and just kind of go through
each piece of equipment or tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, just some notes for
beginners and advice you have on things
[SPEAKER_00]: and should go pretty good from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think starting with grow tent or
really grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing indoors, for example,
I have a spare bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a nine by 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in that spare bedroom,
I have a couple of grow tents because I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have one tent that's for
vegetation stage, you know, a different
[SPEAKER_00]: light cycle than the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally have a two by four tent
and also a four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a new grower kind of reaches out
to you and they're like, what should I get
[SPEAKER_00]: for a grow tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically answer to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I usually ask people two questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is, first off, what are your
goals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you trying to grow a ton or are
you just trying to set up a little hobby
[SPEAKER_01]: grow for yourself, maybe you and a
significant other or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are you looking to, you know,
really max out your space as best as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other question I like to ask
people too is, you know, like what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: budget and what kind of space are you
working with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, tell me more about where you're
trying to put this grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you have a big space,
maybe putting some little tents in there
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense, or maybe it makes sense to go
crazy and fill the whole room with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just depends on what are your
goals and what kind of budget you've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, but I love both approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in both a big room in one building
that I have, I have a separate building
[SPEAKER_01]: out back with its own little environment
set up with its own little, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioning, all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also use tents, you know,
I use tents here in my office actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have two tents right in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I love small tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love big tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love big rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all just depends on, you know,
what's your budget, what are your goals
[SPEAKER_01]: and what kind of space you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, everybody's situation is a
little bit different, but tents are great
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you said, you can have a veg
tent and a flower tent, setting up
[SPEAKER_01]: different environments like that gives you
so much opportunity to try things,
[SPEAKER_01]: try, you know, if you want to try doing
some plant breeding or you want to try
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping some other plants or doing some
cloning or, you know, having separate
[SPEAKER_01]: environments really gives you that option
to, to do a lot of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always tell people two tents if you
can, or two separate rooms, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really opens up a lot of possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say they want to go with two different
tents and they've got their sizes picked
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a particular brand that you
recommend or brands that you say to avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: because maybe they're poor quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I always tell people with tents
going for something well made is really
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grow tent is like your house for your
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something really solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want something that's not going to
fall apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always used guerrilla grow tents
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love guerrilla grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make really good quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, they've also had many
years to perfect their design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it seems like they're always kind of
adding little features or making little
[SPEAKER_01]: tweaks to the tent to make it more user
friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like they've got double doors
that kind of open up in front of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you access kind of all the way
around your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, however, also say too, I really like
AC infinity makes some really good tents
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on more of a budget,
AC infinity tents are really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the double doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only have a single door, but they're
still really well made, still have a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of great features and they're not going to
fall apart on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's so much of the big thing
with grow tents is there's some really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of lower quality ones out there that
aren't going to last you, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: much more than a grow or two at the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always tell people invest in a good
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something to, you know, spend a
little more on getting something quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and something well made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got two great options there with
AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And gorilla grow tent, they both make
really sturdy tents that are going to last
[SPEAKER_01]: you many grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got some gorilla grow tent shorty
tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using for like five plus years
and they still look brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big fan of quality tents, whatever you
go with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used both gorilla and AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the AC infinity tents now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my four by four and my two by
four is the AC infinity ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to keep in mind grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like some people aren't aware that
some of these tents don't have that back
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or side window, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, make sure that you, you know,
if you want that feature to where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to access the other side of your
plants, for example, sometimes if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like a four by four, for example,
reaching over your plants or going under
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, it's easier to like walk to
the side of your plan, side of your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, zip down the side and then access
the plants that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that some grow
tents don't have that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, gorilla grow tent ran them for
many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality AC infinity apparently is a
thicker canvas density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's a thicker grow tent from gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a Mars hydro one, which is pretty
decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're two by four is actually,
I think a foot taller than some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: others on the market, which I found to be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause some of these two by four tents,
I think are only four feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me getting it to a five foot tall one
actually made it easier because I could
[SPEAKER_00]: raise up the light more and grow taller,
a little bit taller of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, the Vivo sun ones,
I've had those in the past way back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're talking 2015 ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran their tents and there was some
pinhole light leaks in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely got to be careful and
keep an eye on those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did get their grow tents again
recently, um, a couple of years back and
[SPEAKER_00]: their quality was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, some of these companies,
they may have poor, poor quality to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with, but they've gotten better over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd throw those couple things
out there.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love one of my favorite things about
the gorilla tents is actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a lot of them have the ability to
extend the height.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a tent and you have a really
short space, you can actually get the
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla grow tent shorty, which is what
I'm using in my office here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a shelf in my closet and I can't
fit a normal size tent under the shelf,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can fit the shorty in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I want to use, uh,
if I want to use it in a different space
[SPEAKER_01]: where I don't have to worry about that
limitation of having the shelf there,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put the extension kits in it and
make it, you know, back up to seven feet
[SPEAKER_01]: tall or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're choosing your tent too,
that's a great tip is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: look at what space you have and look at
the dimensions of all the different tents
[SPEAKER_01]: and find the one that's going to fit your
space the best because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them have different heights and
that can really affect your options when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even with the four by fours,
I mean, there's some brands that are only
[SPEAKER_00]: have like a six foot tall and then other
ones are close to seven feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that can make a difference there
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, height is major, really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about ventilation system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we're talking about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that are new would be the inline
fan or exhaust fan, ducting, carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all makes up your, your ventilation
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically run for ventilation
system in these different sizes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get four inch kits,
six inch kits, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size grow tents would those go in and
what brands are you typically
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I really liked the AC and Finney
ventilation equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their automated speed controller,
uh, which I'm sure you're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the ability to, you know,
set a minimum and a maximum temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: right there on the little control panel
and letting the controller kind of control
[SPEAKER_01]: the fan speed to get the environment where
you want is so helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, really has made growing in
my office here way easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I also really like what that
controller, you can set a maximum speed on
[SPEAKER_01]: your fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have your fan in your house or
in a bedroom or somewhere where there's
[SPEAKER_01]: people, sometimes you might not want that
noise all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sound of the fan going full blasts all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually limit my fans in my office
to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, you know, never go higher than
60% and that keeps them running really
[SPEAKER_01]: quiet, which means I'm able to do things
like podcasts here in my office without,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, worrying about raging fan noises
in the background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as far as sizes go, I tell people,
usually if you're looking at like a three
[SPEAKER_01]: by three and smaller, you're probably fine
with a four inch fan, four inch ducting,
[SPEAKER_01]: four inch carbon filter, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're going for, you know,
maybe a four by four to a five by five,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can probably get away with like a six
inch fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start going for something
big, like a four by eight or a five by
[SPEAKER_01]: nine or something real big, that's when
you want to be looking at eight inches or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you're going really big,
that's when you start looking at the 10
[SPEAKER_01]: inch fans or the really big beast fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, for most small office grows or
small tents, I mean, I love a good four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four, uh, or a good, you know,
two by four tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, usually a four inch or a six
inch is good enough for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for three by three tents,
there are people who put the six inches in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, six inch ventilation systems,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the four by eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran the six inch ventilations in
there and it's been fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, an eight inch might give you
that little extra speed that you might
[SPEAKER_00]: need if you really getting a lot of heat
generated from those lights in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: With those AC infinity fans, I always
recommend people to go a little bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can turn them down,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can limit the speed or because they've
got the automated speed controller in
[SPEAKER_01]: them, they'll turn themselves down if
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, you know, you have a little
extra fan capacity if you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's a really hot day and you
need a little extra fan power to keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent cool, you've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and you can always tune it
down or run it a little bit at a lower
[SPEAKER_01]: speed if you want it quieter or,
you know, you don't need as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you're running a carbon filter
on there, you might want to go with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit because that restricts the
airflow a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I tell people, is if you're going
to run a carbon filter on your ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: system, you might want to opt for a little
bit higher of a size, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were on a budget and you want
to just keep things bare bones,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there a particular brand that you kind
of recommend besides it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, AC infinity, you're looking at,
you know, over a hundred bucks for an
[SPEAKER_00]: inline fan by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are inline fans out there
that can be cheaper, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find something that's like 60,
70 bucks with just a variable speed
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any brands that you can think of
that you would maybe recommend for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's trying to keep it under a
budget?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, I would actually maybe look at
some of AC infinity's cheaper fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have some smaller fans that are a
little bit less expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have like, I think a less powerful
line of fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do really recommend people look into
getting a fan with that speed controller
[SPEAKER_01]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think it's worth the extra
investment, you know, spend an extra 30
[SPEAKER_01]: bucks to get that controller in my
opinion, cause it really does make a big
[SPEAKER_01]: difference as far as controlling the
environment, controlling your humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can go cheap on your fan,
but when you think about it, your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment really plays a huge role in
the success of your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would urge people not to go super
cheap on their fan, but yeah, you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: away with a cheaper fan if you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just all about getting it dialed
in and focus on getting your environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters where you want them,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like does the fan achieve the goals you
want, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, the AC infinity fans with the
speed controller are kind of a no brainer
[SPEAKER_01]: just because the speed controller is so
huge as far as keeping the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: nice, getting your, you know, humidity in
check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's just worth spending a little
more for one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you can go with a budget
fan though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you just gotta make sure
it's gonna do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody were to reach out to you and
say, Hey, what's the best girl light?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your answer for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, such a tricky question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've used a lot of lights over the
years, the two companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with right now are the two
companies that I've been having good
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences with lately are HLG and AC
infinity again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, HLG, a horticulture lighting group
makes really good quality lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be a little bit on the pricier
side compared to some of the stuff out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I do think it's worth it for the
quality and the customer service you get
[SPEAKER_01]: from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they can also answer any questions
from you as far as like finding the right
[SPEAKER_01]: light for your, your space or how to best
array your lights or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also really am a big fan of
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I really hate wasting electricity in
my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting lights with a high efficiency
rating, uh, which HLG always has some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best efficiency on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that it pays off in the long
run, you know, your electric bill being a
[SPEAKER_01]: little lower every month, you know,
makes up for the light costing a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more upfront.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've also had great experiences
though, with the AC infinity lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've got one of their lights in my two
by two tent here in the office with me and
[SPEAKER_01]: it does a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also really like it's got a built in
dimmer right on the top of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really easy to just dim it up and
down super quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tap that button.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't need as much light or if you
are worried about heat, you can also dim
[SPEAKER_01]: it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I also really like, I believe their
lights are IP 65 rated or IP 64 rated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember which one, but they are
water resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to worry about
accidentally spraying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing like a foliar spray in
your tent or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just rinse them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, to me, that's a really good
feature to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had great experiences with both
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a lot of other lights and
they're good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell people, you know, lighting and
environment is a great place to invest in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's places to go cheap and
then there's places to invest is how I
[SPEAKER_01]: like to think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lighting and environment are two
places where it's worth spending a little
[SPEAKER_01]: extra money to get efficiency quality and
get the kind of, you know, performance you
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked about lighting every,
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's somebody in my DMs asking
about lighting and lighting is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've dug deeper into over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those folks have been following me for
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do part testing on lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a year doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had my hands on over 50 grow
lights or testing them, learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: them, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually gotten to a point where I've
gotten the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so often that every year now I do the
research on the lights and put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: list of the best led grow lights of that
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually list them on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have five different articles for the
different sites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just refer people over to those
lists.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically like 10 lights per size
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I do want to mention,
I know I'm going to get some criticism for
[SPEAKER_00]: this is I feel like we're at the point
where you can get the job done and get
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal growth for a decent price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many, what am I,
what am I trying to get at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to get at, there's a lot of
overpriced lights on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I, I'm trying to get at,
I'm trying to get at, I'm trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: at, I feel like for the size grow space
you're working in, set yourself for a
[SPEAKER_00]: budget for that size.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I don't think you should
spend any more than $200 on a two by two
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a two by four, no more than $420
should you spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a three by three grow space,
no more than $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a four by four grow space,
no more than $800.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for a five by five grow space,
no more than a thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: From all the research I've ever done,
I find tons of grow lights that get the
job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the good amount of par being
embedded from those grow lights for prices
[SPEAKER_00]: under those, those dollar amounts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tons of good lights out there
that fall above that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not taking anything away from
those companies whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of good grow lights out
there that are more expensive than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can definitely get away with
spending less than those numbers for those
[SPEAKER_00]: sizes grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you search.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you, you're spot on.
[SPEAKER_01]: With your numbers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're like right in the ballpark
about how much about people should spend.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I'll add to that is in some
cases, it might be worth looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency and seeing like, Oh,
if this one light's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more efficient than the other one,
meaning it's going to use, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: less Watts to give you the same amount of
par, maybe spend a little bit more on it
[SPEAKER_01]: because the longer you use it,
the more that'll make sense over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if your electric bills a little
cheaper every month, that'll help pay for
[SPEAKER_01]: that difference between, you know,
a cheaper light and a more expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always try to look at efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I really like to look at
when I'm looking at lights is how well is
[SPEAKER_01]: it going to cover your space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned picking the right light
for whatever size of tent or whatever size
[SPEAKER_01]: of setup you're going and make sure you
get a light that's going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: give you a full spread over that full area
and make sure you can use all your
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive grow tent real estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but I think you're spot on with
your numbers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say too, like I tend to like more
higher end lights, but you can grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, much lower end, much cheaper
light and still have a great time,
[SPEAKER_01]: still have great success.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people get super hardcore
and nerdy about their lights and want the
[SPEAKER_01]: most efficient, most powerful everything,
you know, and I'm not that guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm not that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have really nice lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that the AC and fan lights are
water resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a really good feature to
have in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can have success with all
kinds of lights being high budget lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: low budget lights, just make sure you've
got the power and the coverage you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, after that, I say look at
efficiency, you know, try to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting a decent efficiency for
your money, because that's going to impact
[SPEAKER_01]: the running cost of your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You always have your startup cost of
buying your light, but then you also have
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost of what's this going to cost me
every month that I keep this light on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so keep that in mind too,
when you're shopping is advice I always
[SPEAKER_01]: like to share with people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So efficiency translated as micro moles
per joule, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the number a lot of people
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a good number that people should go
after?
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, like the minimum number I
should say, I know three, four years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: is like 2.0 micro moles per joule or
higher is a good efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's what more like 2.5 ish or higher
or what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's always going up,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would say you definitely want
over two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say that's like a good place to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, just start comparing
prices of like, okay, if I spend this much
[SPEAKER_01]: more on a light, how much more efficiency
is that going to buy me?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is that going to get me to 2.5
or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that going to, you know, and if it's
not, you can, you can actually do the math
[SPEAKER_01]: if you really want to and figure out,
you know, how much is this light going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cost me each month?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that for each light if you want
to really break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I'd say, you know, anything
above two is going to get you in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ballpark of where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get higher than that,
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you can get way higher than
that, that's great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on how much you willing to
spend because oftentimes efficiency comes
[SPEAKER_01]: with that higher price tag, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think both HLG and AC and Findy are
right in that ballpark and they do it at a
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I tend to stick with those
brands or that's why I often recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: those brands to people, but there are lots
of other brands too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just take a peek at that efficiency
and then maybe look at a couple other
[SPEAKER_01]: lights too and see like, am I,
is this really efficient compared to what
[SPEAKER_01]: else is out there at the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it does seem like efficiency
numbers are changing all the time and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a little hard to keep up with sometimes,
but I think we are approaching slowly the
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretical maximum efficiency of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, I'd say something above two
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody is looking at two different
grill lights and they're stuck between
[SPEAKER_00]: these two and one of them is at 2.5 micro
moles per joule and the other one's at 2.7
[SPEAKER_00]: micro moles per joule and the one that's
at 2.7 micro moles per joule is $200 more
[SPEAKER_00]: than the one that's 2.5 micro moles per
joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it for them to spend that $200
more in order to get that little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient fixture?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I'd have to do the math on that
to really give you like the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way I think of it too is the
longer you plan on using that light,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more the efficiency is going to
matter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And efficiency also, another thing I like
to keep in mind is efficiency also matters
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more in a veg light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds a little counterintuitive,
but if you're looking at a light that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to run 18 hours a day,
you know, you're running that more hours
[SPEAKER_01]: per day, getting better efficiency out of
that might be a little bit more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say it's up to you, you know,
you have to really think about your own
[SPEAKER_01]: budget as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you have that extra $200 to
spend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in that case, you make the upgrade,
you know, go for the more efficient light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't, then, you know, there's
nothing wrong with going with the slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: less efficient light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just remember that each month when that
electric bill comes, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: paying a tiny bit more because you went
with that less efficient light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, do what you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always try to buy lights that are
going to last me like five years or more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's always my goal is I want,
I don't like buying tons of equipment and
[SPEAKER_01]: replacing stuff all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd rather pay a little bit more for a
higher end light that I know I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to keep a little bit longer,
but that's kind of just my preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's up to you and how you run
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but I think either way, either of
those choices would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what's best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe also how much your electricity
costs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some areas have really cheap
electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some areas have really expensive
electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got pretty pricey electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to go for efficiency whenever I
can cause that means I can run more lights
[SPEAKER_01]: or run, you know, lights more often,
or, um, you know, use my power for other
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it just depends on your setup,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a new grower were to reach out and
say, should I do soil or should I do
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your answer to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tend to say you can really do
either, but the most important thing is to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you're picking a system that
works together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I always think of nutrition and
plant media as being equal halves to the
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to think about your medium,
but you also got to think about what kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of nutrients you're going to be using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to use living soil in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'm putting, you know,
all the nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on building the soil as a
battery to kind of power the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the style I really like doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that it's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that I only have to water my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about mixing up
nutrients and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, some people like mixing up
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like the control that bottle
nutrients give them and like the
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility that bottle nutrients give
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that sounds more like your style,
maybe cocoa is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've done some great grows with
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done some great grows with bagged
soil and liquid nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done some great grows with living
soil and dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just kind of depends on what
style kind of speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say that with living soil,
you do a lot of the work up front,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend a lot of time building your
soil, prepping your soil, making sure the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil is nice and balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you've got lots of life in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe getting some mulch and some cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're doing a lot of prep work
to get your soil ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once the grow started,
all I really have to do is water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the soil's got all the food in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have to think about
nutrition a whole lot for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to just kind of, you know,
use the irrigation system or hand water
[SPEAKER_01]: and it makes things really simple that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if I make a mistake, or if I
screw something up, you know, I've maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: painted myself into a corner by using
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like both styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for new growers, it really depends
on what speaks to you because I really
[SPEAKER_01]: think both systems can work well,
both either a cocoa based system where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding liquid nutrients all the
time works really well for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you maybe have space limitations,
you don't have room for a huge pile of
[SPEAKER_01]: soil at your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't want to be mixing up
dirt in your house anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then maybe cocoa is for you or maybe if
you live in an apartment or like a trailer
[SPEAKER_01]: or something, you know, in those cases,
liquid nutrients, I think tend to work out
[SPEAKER_01]: better for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I really think it's up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just is a preference thing,
you know, and I've like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done great grows with cocoa and
bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done great grows with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just about picking what
speaks to you as a grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think different strokes for different
folks, different, you know, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be drawn to different styles of
doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always been drawn to the living
soil way of doing things because I love
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, you know, microbes and nature
doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to pretend I'm a forest ranger
in my grow more than like a chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people like being a chemist
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like mixing all the different
chemicals, like checking the pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: like checking all their numbers and all
that and like having that degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of more of a let's build an
ecosystem style of grower, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how I like to do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say if you're a new grower,
look at both approaches and see what
[SPEAKER_01]: speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do you think you want the
control of a bottle nutrient grow with
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa where you're able to dial things in
really specifically and you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: control, but that also means you're the
one in charge, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the one who's got to balance
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the one who's got to make sure
you're following a feed chart or following
[SPEAKER_01]: a feed plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas living soil, I feel like you kind
of follow a recipe at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You set it up and then it's kind of nature
does a lot of the work for you from then
[SPEAKER_01]: on out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, again, it just depends on your
approach and what kind of speaks to you as
[SPEAKER_01]: a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, living soil has been the way
for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of soil and just love
getting my hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, all depends on what what
speaks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have much to add to that one,
except for there is one thing to keep in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like with soil, it holds on to like
the water nutrients a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: than cocoa, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one thing I noticed as I was going back
and forth between soil and cocoa is you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to water a little bit more often when
you're in cocoa because the more area of a
[SPEAKER_00]: medium doesn't hold water as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say you can't overwater
cocoa, but I found that to be false.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can totally overwater cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've seen plants where clearly
there was a lack of oxygen in the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone because I was overwatering them,
but it is a little bit more difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwater cocoa, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the plant size is going to
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the container is going to
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, cocoa holds a
little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to water it more
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something to keep in mind if you're
looking to be a little more hands off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're going to get into auto
watering systems here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just as far as hand watering
could be a little bit more labor if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting in there a little bit more often
to water cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I forgot to add that one in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about pot size and type?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they could choose either plastic
or fabric or air pots are out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Size container is a common question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what size should I start in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I transplant or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should be my final container?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically recommend for pot
size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I like to think of nutrition and
medium and pots and all that stuff kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: as a system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what system you're going
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going with a cocoa grow and I'm
using liquid nutrients, smaller pots are
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with much smaller pots of
that style of grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say also with cocoa, as you're
saying, you kind of are feeding every time
[SPEAKER_01]: you water typically and you're also
watering a bit more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those cases, I think air pruning
pots, so something like a fabric pot that
[SPEAKER_01]: helps kind of prune the sides,
it'll actually keep the plant from
[SPEAKER_01]: spiraling its roots can be really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: For living soil though, I really think big
pots are the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I always think of it is with
living soil, your soil is the battery,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want a battery that's going to
last you from the start of your grow all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way to your end of the grow,
you're going to need a pretty big battery
[SPEAKER_01]: to hold all that nutrition in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for living soil, I typically tell
people you want your final pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot you go into flower with to be at
least 10 gallons, probably more like 15
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a good 15 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love beds and much bigger pots too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for cocoa, I think you've got a lot
more wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa, I definitely like the air pruning
pots, like a fabric pot or one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: aero pots can be beneficial because they
dry out the media a little bit faster,
[SPEAKER_01]: which means you get to water a little bit
sooner, which means you get to feed a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas living soil, you really want the
soil to stay moist pretty much all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that soil to keep alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got microbes in that soil that are
helping break down all the nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: make them plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you let that soil dry out too much,
the microbes kind of go dormant and that
[SPEAKER_01]: makes nutrition much less available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole kind of biological system
kind of starts to shut down when things
[SPEAKER_01]: get too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping soil a little bit more moisture
helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having bigger pots helps you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a small pot, it's going to dry
out a lot faster, especially if you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: a little tiny pot with a big old plant in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always in both growth styles tend to
push people into going with larger pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, I do think the more roots,
more fruits, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just, I think plants are
healthier when they've got a good size
[SPEAKER_01]: root system supporting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow a little tiny pot this big,
but you grow a big giant plant in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really asking a lot of those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really pushing them hard and
they're going to have to work really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure that plant's getting enough
water and nutrition and all that other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas when you've got a good size pot,
you got a little more wiggle room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a little bit more of a buffer in
case you make a mistake with your feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: or in case you make a mistake with your
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things aren't going to go bad on you like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always try to push people towards
larger pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me in living soil, I really like
at least 10 gallons maybe even 15 if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can, or bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown some great plants in 25 gallons
too, but I understand not everybody has
[SPEAKER_01]: the space for gigantic pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can, I really like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's quite a few people who will
do living soil, but they'll do the fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will grow, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of what you mentioned earlier,
the medium needs to stay moist at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have these fabric pots,
they actually dry out from all different
[SPEAKER_00]: angles, which isn't natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grassroots fabric pots, they make a fabric
pot with a liner in the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fabric up top, then it's a liner
most of the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the very bottom, I want to say it's
like two inches from the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fabric again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that helps keep the moisture in on all
the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of people that are growing
with organics, living soil are going
[SPEAKER_00]: towards those pots or plastic pots versus
just the straight up fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd mention that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really great thing to bring
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love those pots, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those grassroot fabric pots with the liner
inside of them work outstanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, I actually use them in my
bigger grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have their beds, they make beds with the
same liner in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have two three by three beds in my
bigger grow with the living soil liner on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does such a good job of keeping the
moisture in because like you were saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want the air pruning at the bottom,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want things to start drying out at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want there to be drainage at the
bottom of your pot or the bottom of your
[SPEAKER_01]: bed, but you don't want those sides and
you don't want the top drying out super
[SPEAKER_01]: fast with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that starts to shut the soil down,
starts making the microbes all go to
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I love those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are a great recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about environment monitors?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing indoors, temperature,
humidity, a lot of people track a VPD now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any monitors in the market that
you generally recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the Pulse monitors for
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It monitors temperature, humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think their newer monitor also has CO2
and has a built-in light meter,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a chance to play with that
one yet, but the older ones that I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of them around my grow and
being able to track and log the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also love it's got a feature where it
will alert you if there's a problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can set up your parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has saved my butt a number of
times from some, from some problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had a dehumidifier
malfunction, you know, and I would never
[SPEAKER_01]: have known I would have come back several
days later and my plants would have been
[SPEAKER_01]: real unhappy, except I have this wonderful
Pulse monitor that sent me an email
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, Hey, something looks a little bit
off in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should come check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really liked the Pulse monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a little bit on the expensive
side, but if you're a serious grower and
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're like going to be doing it for a
while, I think it's worth the investment
[SPEAKER_01]: to pick one up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like the AC infinity controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about earlier, the
controllers built into their fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can get one that's Bluetooth
enabled or wifi enabled and it has some
[SPEAKER_01]: monitoring too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually logs your temperatures,
logs your humidity, and you can log into
[SPEAKER_01]: the app and actually see all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having the ability to see how your
temperatures and humidity change
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the day or throughout the light
cycle, I think is really valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I used to dial my grow in during
the day, but then I was like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what's going on at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, having the Pulse monitor and
having the AC infinity tents in there
[SPEAKER_01]: actually lets me look at that,
lets me see, you know, when my lights are
[SPEAKER_01]: off at four in the morning, what's going
on in my grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, the plants, it's important
to the plants all the time with their
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, not just when you happen
to be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a tool that logs and also a tool
that alerts you, both can be really
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I understand the Pulse meters are a
little bit more on the expensive side,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're serious about growing and
you know, if you're setting up an
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that you're trying to really
keep dialed in, I think they're worth the
[SPEAKER_01]: investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a good idea to, you know,
track that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's helped me be a better grower,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, being able to track my settings
and being able to notice things like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, my humidity is way out of whack at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it helps me make better
decisions in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say they're, they're definitely a
tool I would recommend, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in your budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great being able to see the line
graph, like you mentioned with the
[SPEAKER_00]: history, be able to see the temperature,
humidity, VPD, all in a line graph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see the history, what it looked
like for the past hour, what it looked
[SPEAKER_00]: like for the past day, what it looked like
for the past week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That functionality with AC infinity
controller is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm using right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also similar to that is the sensor push
monitor I used for like past five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with the AC infinity one,
I don't even know if I'm going to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor push one anymore because AC
infinity now has it built into the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller, same style line graph and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a really good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the monitor for sensor push was
like 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for the wifi gateway was a hundred
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 150 bucks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Pulse monitor, that you
mentioned the Pulse one is 200 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, unless they change the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the Pulse pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one with the PAR meter built
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 500 bucks, but you know,
it's kind of getting up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it does actually CO2 as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 monitor PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look to see what that has,
it could definitely be beneficial to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: that extra money.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking to monitor your CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not many, many CO2 monitors on the
market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe AC infinity is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they're working on one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like they're working on
everything these days and they're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out some really high quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's only a matter of time before
they're doing CO2 equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke about their fan earlier and
that's one of the other things I think
[SPEAKER_01]: adds value to it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're paying a pretty decent price
for a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fact that you're getting a
fan plus an environmental controller plus
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental monitor all for that one
price, it makes the AC infinity fan kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a no brainer in my mind, as far as the
value of it, because you're getting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, three things in one,
you know, for the price of a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good call out,
but the environmental monitors,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you're getting some sort of
notification, that's helpful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a sensor push, you can set the
notifications to if it reaches a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, you get alerted on your
smartphone or it goes below a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the pulse monitor does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if they, I haven't played
around with it too much yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they give you some sort of phone
alerts, if the temperature goes too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the fan will kick on and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not sure if alerts will actually come
to your smartphone when it gets out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges that you've set.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely can be valuable to be
alerted when things are out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you can go in and investigate
and make adjustments as necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just have your environmental
controller do it, which is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environmental controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's Neewa, there's Trollmaster,
there's Inkbird.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your experience with
environmental controllers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a ton, to be honest,
outside of the AC infinity controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've played a little bit with some of the
smart plug base ones, like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Inkbird is a little bit of a
smart plug, but there's also like the CASA
[SPEAKER_01]: smart plugs and some of those other smart
plug things that can be used to control
[SPEAKER_01]: things and work as environmental
controllers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my big concerns about some of
those controllers is when they're wifi
[SPEAKER_01]: based, I've seen ones that if your wifi
goes down, they don't work properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they start doing strange things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a smart plug that when my wifi went
out, it would just turn everything on,
[SPEAKER_01]: which wasn't really what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say just like, keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be kind of a vulnerability with
some of those wifi based systems is if
[SPEAKER_01]: your wifi goes down, how's it going to
react?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to understand that before you
base your whole grow on something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't use a whole lot of like
big system, you know, whole system
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental controllers, but I think
using the built-in control options on
[SPEAKER_01]: things like your air conditioner or your
dehumidifier is usually kind of the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as opposed to using some sort of smart
device to control it for you, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: typically the built-in controllers built
into most grow equipment tends to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think those smart plugs and the Neewa
and some of those other things have good
[SPEAKER_01]: potential, but you just have to make sure
that you're not going to run into a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem if your internet goes down or your
power goes off and then comes back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's it going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to remember the settings from
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to forget them and you're
going to have to go reprogram everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in my mind why for just small
grows, I find that AC infinity fan with
[SPEAKER_01]: the built-in controller to be just hard to
pass up because it's made growing in my
[SPEAKER_01]: office so much easier being able to have
that environmental control where all I
[SPEAKER_01]: really do to control the environment in my
smaller tents is keep my house at a
[SPEAKER_01]: regular temperature, you know,
keep my house comfortable for me to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I let the AC infinity fan
controller work out the details,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I let it fine tune everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find as long as I keep my house,
you know, between 60 and 80 degrees or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and keep humidity in a
reasonable range, the AC infinity
[SPEAKER_01]: controller is able to dial my grow in,
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for my larger grow, I'm using
individual devices that aren't plugged
[SPEAKER_01]: into any kind of controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all just kind of set at their own
parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have a standalone dehumidifier,
standalone air conditioner, and those are
[SPEAKER_01]: all using their own internal controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think there's some value in
some of those other controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful and just be aware of the
failure points of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, be aware of if something goes
wrong, how's it going to behave?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the big failure points with
some of these controllers to keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had the troll master controller
for a very short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why I got rid of it is I
plugged in my humidifier into there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can plug in your humidifier,
dehumidifier, heater, air conditioner,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That that's the point of these
environmental controllers is to plug your
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment in there and then they'll turn
on and off as necessary to control your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the downsides is it doesn't
actually control the function on and off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to turn the unit on,
but in order to actually start spitting
[SPEAKER_00]: out that humidification, right,
the water vapor into the air, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to press another button be turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the troll master isn't able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are going to get one of these
environmental controllers, make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the equipment that you already
spent money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your humidifier, dehumidifier,
air conditioner, heater, make sure those
[SPEAKER_00]: things are going to automatically turn on
once power is given to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just figure out that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a pretty big downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really disappointed when I first got
the troll master and realized that it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't going to work with my equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my heater, air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to increase the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use it with the heater or
you need to decrease, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's too much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are adding in some sort of air
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked to us about heater,
air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any specific brands or equipment
that you recommend folks to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd say a lot of this depends too on
the size of your equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're running a two by two
tent, probably shouldn't be looking at air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioners or, you know, big heaters or
anything like that, because it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in those cases, if you're running a
smaller tent or smaller environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it works best just to control the
environment of the room the tents in,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me in the office tents here,
I'm using my house AC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a dehumidifier in here,
but I'm in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my humidity stays pretty good most of
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the bigger grow outside, I have a
frigid air dehumidifier that's worked
[SPEAKER_01]: really well for me for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a mini split.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing I was going to say as
far as air conditioners go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Efficiency is another really big thing
with air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the little portable ones,
the little ones with the hoses that come
[SPEAKER_01]: out of them and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've used those before and they work,
but man, you lose so much efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use so much power just to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really adds up on your bill
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a mini split is a really expensive
option too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a really nice mini split air
conditioner can cost you several thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're serious about growing and
you've got a bigger grow environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: or if you've got a couple of tents in one
room or something, getting a big mini
[SPEAKER_01]: split will save you money in the long term
because the efficiency is so much better
[SPEAKER_01]: than a lot of those smaller air
conditioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have to, you can use a window air
conditioner or use what you can't and it
[SPEAKER_01]: depends so much on your grow, how serious
you're going to have to get about things
[SPEAKER_01]: like air conditioning and
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's another one of those areas of
your grow where I say it's worth investing
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more money to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth getting quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth getting more efficient stuff
because man, running a really inefficient
[SPEAKER_01]: air conditioner will cost you a ton of
money and you'll quickly regret it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy if you live somewhere
really hot and you start running one of
[SPEAKER_01]: those little portable AC units all day
every day, be prepared for a big old power
[SPEAKER_01]: bill at the end of the month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me growing in the house here in the
small tents, I've got a two by two and a
[SPEAKER_01]: two by four in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to keep this room at a pretty
decent temperature just kind of using my
[SPEAKER_01]: home climate control, using my home
ventilation system works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there can be other problems with using
bigger, um, grows, you know, at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to start looking into
something a little bit more expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it just depends so much on your
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I, I'm a big fan of,
uh, frigid air for a lot of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I also like Fujitsu.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going for a mini split Fujitsu
makes excellent mini splits, but they are
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I spent something like $3,000 for
my 18 K mini split unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the good thing about that though is
it's was a, the most efficient unit on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also, um, you know, has a 10 year
warranty that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it hurt a little bit to pull up my
wallet and smack down that three grand to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I know I'm set for the next 10
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got a good air conditioner
that's going to last me a long time and my
[SPEAKER_01]: monthly bills aren't going to be huge
because I'm using a really high efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I mean, it just depends so
much on your setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as soon as you start getting
into bigger grows, bigger tents,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, running a lot of lights,
you're probably looking at a mini split.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're running smaller tents,
I would say try to do what you can with
[SPEAKER_01]: just your home air conditioning system,
you know, see what you can do with just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to keep your house or keep the
room, your tents in at a decent
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, and then use something like
the AC infinity controller or another
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental controller to really work
out the details, you know, to fine tune
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I find with grow tents, if you can get
to the, to the ballpark, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: environment wise, you can use a controller
to kind of get you the last little mile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to get away with using the
central air conditioning at my house as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I'd past couple of years,
I've been successful not growing during
[SPEAKER_00]: the summer months, July and August in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan my grow, you know, plan it so I can
have enough harvest to last me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to grow in those couple of
months can drastically bring down the
[SPEAKER_00]: energy bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did use a portable air conditioner at
one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you had mentioned, like once you
get that electricity bill, it just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's skyrockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of energy those things consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot more friendlier on your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the air conditioning in
your home, at least that's been it from my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to heating, I have
actually been pretty successful using a
[SPEAKER_00]: tower heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, controlling the
temperature and humidity in your lung room
[SPEAKER_00]: or the room that your grow tent is in is
definitely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have my tower heater there,
but sometimes I also have a tower heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I actually have one in the grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, because when the lights turn off
winter time, temperature does drop quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it can certainly drop to the
high fifties, you know, low sixties where
[SPEAKER_00]: I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, so having a tower heater,
just kick on for a short period of time in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to reach that set point that's on
the actual heater has definitely been
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those tower heaters, they're not that
expensive, you know, 50 bucks,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does consume a lot of Watts,
but they're not on for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to see a, a massive
change in your electricity bill unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running it all day long.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and with heaters too, I really like,
uh, I use in the past, I've used,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, those like radiator style heaters
where it actually looks like a little
[SPEAKER_01]: radiator and it's full of oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefit of that is, is when it's
on, it heats up that oil and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: circulates it around inside the radiator,
but it even keeps working once the power
[SPEAKER_01]: is turned off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that oil stays warm, that radiator
stays warm, and it keeps kind of heating
[SPEAKER_01]: the space even when there's not power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowing into the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I really like those for heating
grows because they're a lot safer than a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the other styles of grow or of
heater, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, having that efficiency factor of
the kind of keep working a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: even when the power has been cut,
they'll kind of keep heating the room a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit longer because they hold heat
in that radiator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call out humidifier
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you kind of talked about that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you have anything else to
add about those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've used as far as humidifiers,
I really like the one that build a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: recommends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what it's called.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the active air or something like
that, but I really like it's a little tank
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can fill up manually,
uh, which I find really helpful where you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to like take the whole tank
apart and take it to the sink and fill it
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a thing where you can just take a
pitcher of water and dump it in the top
[SPEAKER_01]: and away you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's been really helpful to me as
far as dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dehumidifiers is definitely a place if
you're going to buy one, look for
[SPEAKER_01]: something efficient because dehumidifiers
can use a ton of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a big fancy grow,
I mean, look at something like the quest,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, quest dehumidification makes them
really efficient, really powerful
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cost a lot, but you'll save money in
the longterm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, you're buying
something that's going to last you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe a decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of electrical bills,
you know, so spending a little bit more to
[SPEAKER_01]: have something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your bills a little lower every month
will pay off in the longterm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to get something efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have a smaller, um, frigid air
dehumidifier that I'm using right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I really like it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really efficient, um,
despite being kind of a home unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but just keep in mind with
dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I think most dehumidifiers on the
market are made to be put in someone's
[SPEAKER_01]: basement and used, you know, a month or
two a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not designed to be used 24 seven,
you know, 365 days a year, like one year
[SPEAKER_01]: we would in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those home-built dehumidifiers
aren't, don't always have the kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: reliability or the kind of efficiency that
you'd want for a grow dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so just be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there's not a whole lot of
like grow centered or like designed for
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow dehumidifiers out there that are
small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them are really big and really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but either way, just make sure you're
looking at that efficiency number and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you're aware of how much power it's
going to use because they do tend to be
[SPEAKER_01]: power hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a very dry climate, so I've
never had to use a dehumidifier here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been fortunate enough not to have to
have add that to my electricity bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do have to add in a humidifier and
I've tried out so many humidifiers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past, uh, eight years since I've been
here, nine years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of the ones that I really
like is called LeVault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smart humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing that you had mentioned where
it's top fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to remove the whole
container, flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually just remove the top and
fill from the top, but it's also connected
[SPEAKER_00]: to your smartphone and app to where you
can notify you when it needs to be cleaned
[SPEAKER_00]: and also when the tank is empty and you
need to refill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been, that's been the best one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are getting a humidifier,
one thing to mention is you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: you definitely want to get one of those
ones where you can have a set point on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a certain percent that you're
aiming for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some humidifiers, you just have the
on button.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just go on and on and on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have one of them with the,
uh, with the, a humidistat, humidistat,
[SPEAKER_00]: there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: To actually have a set point, a certain
percent that you can aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it reaches that percent, the unit
will turn off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I mentioned, LeVault,
it does have that capability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we got through a lot in this
episode, man, there are so many more
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we could have gone through,
but, uh, I think we might have to save it
[SPEAKER_00]: for potentially a part two if,
uh, if the audience demands it and wants
[SPEAKER_00]: you to come back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could talk about so many other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get into auto watering system,
but we didn't even get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH meters, TDS testers, harvest equipment,
IPM tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more stuff that we could
have gone over, but we just didn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: time this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Hey, maybe a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are tuning in on YouTube,
let us know in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like a part two, also let us know
what questions you have in regards to the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go through and answer some of
these as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you have the time,
if you'd be willing to come on and answer
[SPEAKER_00]: some questions in the comment section as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure people would love to have
your feedback in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about grow happy to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
Yeah.

[SPEAKER_01]: And I also host our patron exclusive
podcast every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call the four 20 happy hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hang out live with our audience and get
the chat about growing, answer grow
[SPEAKER_01]: questions, talk about different grow
topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, you can always find me over
in the dude grows crew or hit me up on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram or anywhere else.

a landing page for new growers with all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to start a grow, want to
expand your grow, want to learn more,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, go check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, as far as what's coming up,
uh, probably the latest thing I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: working on is I've gotten more into
breeding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started breeding my own plants and,
uh, release some seeds publicly for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time recently and really excited to
get further into plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's something I'm really
passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning about different strains and,
uh, you know, combining flavors and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of stuff is really my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, it's been a lot of fun
learning about it and it's been great
