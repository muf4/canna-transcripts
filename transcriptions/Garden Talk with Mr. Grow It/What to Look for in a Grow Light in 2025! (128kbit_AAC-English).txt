[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of folks who are shopping
for grow lights, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in 2025, what should growers look for
when purchasing a grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the question is, is right off
the bat is what it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the, the map, you know, where are you
trying to go is where you're going to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get, you know, so like, let's say
you're in a tent and you're inside your
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right off the bat, we've kind of
nixed HPS out of the picture, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to be able to grow with
high intensity lighting in a, in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: tent atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because you have to air cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the things that's really
got me educated on this, like even 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago is, you know, growing in a
pre-LED environment, we were stacking
[SPEAKER_01]: lights together in a small room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all had to be vented hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd run air through the hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd remove all that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the byproduct of that is you were
cooling the bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so color temperature, like you'd have
like a more orange number for the HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that number is, that's an
actual temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Color is temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're lowering the
temperature of the bulb to its actual spec
[SPEAKER_01]: operating thing, you're losing a lot of
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started learning, like,
why is it my friends that like have like
[SPEAKER_01]: Gavita's strapped to their ceiling and
their giant basement are getting what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the same, we'd all shared
genetics back then it was, it was tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there wasn't all the seat,
a lot of the, the, the genetic banks were
[SPEAKER_01]: over in Europe and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be ordering off the back of
magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was sea monkeys or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it wasn't, wasn't a lot of trust
as far as like the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really relying on the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all shared genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd find things that we liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the forum cut of the, of the
cookies, like back, back, back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: when it first came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm noticing these guys are getting
way better results than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that was different is I
was venting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turns out as I started educating
myself, sure enough, I was losing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're losing a lot of power that's
supposed to be hitting those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're choosing, I would say there's
a lot of controversy controversy right now
[SPEAKER_01]: about HPS versus led.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's very,
very interesting is genetic expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with the jug guys, the jug dealers
over at new millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Jaron always likes to say,
phenotype is genotype times environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you and I have the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the same genotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the same genetic profile,
but then you put it outside and I put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a tent and they're going to express
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always wondered, where did all
the things that I loved in the 2000s,
[SPEAKER_01]: where did they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still, I still get the, the name some,
oh, here's the strain you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they give it to me and it's got the
name and it looks kind of like it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it didn't taste the same, didn't smell
the same, didn't, didn't quite look the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it, was it genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, was it all the clothes are being
abused or people lying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not the thing that I did?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I started meeting more people,
more trustworthy guys that are OGs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: game, I started getting the real stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get the real cuts from the real
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still didn't express.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started digging in another hole
in knowledge and I realized, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because they're not grown under
vented hoods with GH nutrients packed
[SPEAKER_01]: together in a tiny room, VPD out of
control, like even bad growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a phenotypic expression that
you enjoy, the only way you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it is through an quote unquote,
an inferior growing process, because what
[SPEAKER_01]: plants were selected under is what they
will thrive under.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you're not running things,
like if you get a genetic and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: take clone from clone to clone,
it will acclimate to your environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it will never, its code is locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you take something and you breed
it, like if you back-cross something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you self it and you self it against itself
and the genetic remains the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: it shuffles the deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always remember that family that I
grew up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was friends with the youngest brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the oldest brother, he was like a
genetic copy of the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle brother was like a genetic copy
of the dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the youngest brother was like a direct
split.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started understanding like,
oh, okay, there it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I was dealing with plants,
I started getting, okay, recessive genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like some of the grandparents come
in, some of the mom comes in, different
[SPEAKER_01]: eye color, different skin tone,
different hair color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take the twin brothers and
you raise them in different places and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to act completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your twins are raised in the same room,
finished each other's sentences,
[SPEAKER_01]: yet twins raised across the country can
have surprisingly different lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this comes back to lighting,
where one of the biggest things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do to change your environment is the
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you chose an HPS versus LED,
one of the things that really makes LED
[SPEAKER_01]: superior to HPS is that you don't need the
cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a watt is a watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have a thousand watt LED and I
have a thousand watt HPS, technically
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking, more light, there's the same
exact heat, but the LEDs produce more
[SPEAKER_01]: light for that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your output is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that LEDs are cooler or
there's more efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a watt of heat equals X amount of BTUs
and you're gonna get what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out that when you measure things
like leaf surface temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go in there with a little
thermometer gun and you point at the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to run your room slightly hotter
with LED because there isn't that
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost no infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see those red diodes in an LED,
that's them trying to stick some red in
[SPEAKER_01]: there because they don't come with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas HPS, high pressure sodium just
kicks out the IR.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you could feel the heat coming
off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why if you go to a restaurant,
you'll see the IR heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have something that isn't glowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not red, it's not hot, to like
visually hot, there's no color coming off
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet you're getting blasted with this heat
that's coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a pure IR lamp that's
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that that wouldn't have a,
I'll raise the temperature a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what is kind of interesting is that
the leaf surface temperature, it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: affects the biotic structure of what's
going on, like heat stresses and things,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though there's micro boundary layers
that your plant creates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we like a lot of airflow and
get them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it breaks those micro boundary layers
across, because it's just got this micro
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of insulation, we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you wanna knock that all off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just raising the temperature of
your room doesn't necessarily get the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant leaf surface temperature all that
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you're bombarded with that IR,
it gets it way higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, so even the things that we
kind of consider not valuable in growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it is affecting the metabolism of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I'm not getting that diesel
expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that 2003 diesel, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like lifestyle Rob and I, when we were
hanging out in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're just the right amount
of boomer millennial.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we remember that 2003 diesel,
baby, where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It still exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to grow it wrong according
to 2025 standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these days, particularly in
the homegrown market, that I feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of people are going with LED
versus the HID.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, HID, whether it be HPS or MH or
even CMH falls into the HID category,
[SPEAKER_00]: high intensity discharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, as far as what to look for when
purchasing a grow light, I think the first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing right off the bat is coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: What area are you trying to cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a two foot by four
foot coverage area, well, you can filter
[SPEAKER_00]: it down by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of get into the
granular details of what's the power
[SPEAKER_00]: output?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the light spectrum look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could even look at like the
diodes, drivers, people get really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really deep into what's the BTU,
the heat output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot of different things that
people can look at.
