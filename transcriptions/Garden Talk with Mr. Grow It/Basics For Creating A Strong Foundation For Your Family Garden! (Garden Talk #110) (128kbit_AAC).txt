[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening, and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 110.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Dave Hanson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave is a father of three, a small
business owner, and some of you may
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize him from the Perfect Gardens
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening since he was a kid,
and he favors organic methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, Dave goes over a
presentation that he created, which goes
[SPEAKER_01]: over some of the basics to create a strong
foundation for a family garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you the presentation slides as
we go along, but if you'd like to download
[SPEAKER_01]: the presentation, I'll link it down in the
YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk Clips
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That channel is dedicated to short clips
of these podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to provide free
[SPEAKER_01]: information about gardening all plants to
the general public.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Dave Hanson.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you through Perfect Gardens
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're very active over there,
and I see you just active in so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different comments section.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we cross paths, getting you on this
podcast was one of the things that we had
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a great topic that you actually
presented, which is you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about some of the basics to create
a strong foundation for your family
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really intriguing to me because at
some point in the future, I might have a
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I have questions on a personal
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you put together a presentation
for this, which I'll have in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: description section.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you click on that, you'll be able to
access this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also be showing it on the screen as
we go along, be kind of flipping back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, if you're on one of the
podcast platforms, you definitely want to
[SPEAKER_01]: head over to YouTube and download that
presentation so you can kind of follow
[SPEAKER_01]: along with this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into the topic,
can you introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Dave Hanson.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you said, I'm pretty active in this
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me over at Perfect Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The communities are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love going around them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The community is always giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was my opportunity I saw to give
back to the community, to share my
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gardening since I was a little
kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had the privilege in the
summertime going out and picking a fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato and washing it off and eating it
right from the vine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later in my teens, my parents kind of let
me experiment and start my own little
[SPEAKER_00]: garden plots in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, at a young age,
I knew I was pretty connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going to probably be doing some
forms of gardening throughout my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I got older, it held true through
different variations of rental homes and
[SPEAKER_00]: buying homes and anything in between,
adapting so that I can continue my skills
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one day when I had a family that I
could pass it down to them, and I do,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a single father of three kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recently this will be I think our
fourth year since we broke ground and our
[SPEAKER_00]: new house and our new garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from here, it's teaching them the
basics, trying not to overcomplicate it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and mainly connecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see this through this
presentation, I'm going to keep it very
[SPEAKER_00]: basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to go into super
technical, but I'm going to outline things
[SPEAKER_00]: for you guys to plant the seeds of
questions to ask yourself every process as
[SPEAKER_00]: you start your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get it started now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about my first time ever gardening
from what I can remember is with my
[SPEAKER_01]: grandparents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was super young and maybe around
five years old or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember the exact age,
but I was pretty big in their life,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it wasn't big in my parents life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it didn't really pass on to me as
a kid as you know, I wish it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, looking back, I wish it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I mentioned, once I have a family
in the future, being able to pass on to my
[SPEAKER_01]: kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, let's get into this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I, and I, the main thing I
tell my kids too is no matter what you
[SPEAKER_00]: choose to do in your life, you don't have
to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to feel the pressure to do
so, but just note that you have the skills
[SPEAKER_00]: and the power to provide for yourself or
your family in the future if you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might not understand that yet,
but it's pretty powerful because we all
[SPEAKER_00]: know the economy and things shift and move
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having this ability is, it's just,
it's so rewarding, not just for as a
[SPEAKER_00]: parent, but just as the children too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting a family garden should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to get overwhelmed with all the
different methods and practices that are
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things will come with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm speaking from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're, if you choose organics,
like don't feel that you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: composting and this type of composting and
ferments, stick with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel the pressure of needing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially nowadays, with platforms
and the availability of information is so
[SPEAKER_00]: great, you know, including your podcast,
Chris, with the information out there at
[SPEAKER_00]: times can be overwhelming and we just get
way too much and we feel that pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't scale your garden to fit your
family schedules and demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember summer's coming, soccer
practices, cheer practices, summer
[SPEAKER_00]: picnics, like what are your demands as a
family?
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are things that are always going
to shift as yourself and your children get
[SPEAKER_00]: older and it'll help you not bite off too
much than you can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember you're going to have awesome
years and not so many great years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some problems may be from your own doing
while others are completely out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what the circumstances may be,
you are still connecting and learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only loss in the garden is opportunity
not taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I planned a vacation and I came back
and all of my ripened tomatoes were bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a lost cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can compost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many avenues in gardening that
you can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a garden should breathe and grow with
your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of goes back to how you
scale that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some years you might expand and get it
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other years it might have to get
smaller or contracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe you move and you go from a house
to a condo on an apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might have to go to pots and something
that's smaller to suit your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those who are watching on Pitcher,
that's our second year of our family
[SPEAKER_00]: garden where we broke ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were super proud of it and I put a
Pitcher on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for us just a little bit
about how many beds you have and what are
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these plants that they're seeing
on the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot has changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our garden does breathe quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of beds, this one had two raised
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was for carrots and one was like this
makeshift one that I have for potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can kind of see it in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a long run of wood and that's all
potatoes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, my kids kind of carved out
paths.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see mulch paths and we just kind
of incorporated plants and plopped them
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have guidance of where I wanted
onions and stuff, but I kind of left it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to them to explore and to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's roughly right now, I think it's about
25 by 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did another new plot last year
and that's probably about a 10 by 10
[SPEAKER_00]: behind my shed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a decent size garden, but don't
let the size discourage you because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can only have a four by four area,
whether it's in the ground directly sowed
[SPEAKER_00]: or in a raised bed, be happy with that and
plant what you can with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually you can have a big garden,
so be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't make me more successful
than the person with the smaller garden by
[SPEAKER_00]: no means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And saying that we're going to go into the
second slide and I outline them as garden
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically you need seeds, plants,
weather and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on your type of growing,
you can even maybe take food out because
[SPEAKER_00]: you might be more towards favoring
microbial or letting the nature kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: extract in mind what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for seeds, make sure you're sourcing
quality seeds that are suited for your
[SPEAKER_00]: region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Choose heirlooms if you're wanting to
collect seeds for the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a plan on planting seeds,
don't buy like seedless watermelons or
[SPEAKER_00]: these hybrids that are really staring
towards genetics that are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a seed to reproduce with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind when you're
purchasing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say only plant organic
seeds or this seeds, your region,
[SPEAKER_00]: your resources are different than mine,
so you have to kind of decipher what's
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What plants can you grow in your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will provide you the most for your
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying most for your money,
I'm saying most for your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's time with your children,
that's time at sports events, that's time
[SPEAKER_00]: just around the dinner table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your growing zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to go into this in the
future slide, but the growing zone is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important and what challenges may
arise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live in Northern Illinois,
my problems would be at times extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: high humidity, other times really dry and
hot, and then two days later back to
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're kind of thinking of VPD
outside, my VVD ranges are all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place and I have to take that into
consideration of what crops will grow good
[SPEAKER_00]: for my time in my region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one is food.
[SPEAKER_00]: What sources of food or fertilizer will
you need?
[SPEAKER_00]: What techniques interest you slash line up
with your values?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of goes into taking on
techniques and all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is to your values?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody wants to do compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, for myself, I like doing ferments,
but I probably will never try a JDOM
[SPEAKER_00]: wedding agent or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, it just doesn't do anything
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that I can source that from
other people in the community over like
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Goblin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's very competent and has mastered
the safety and the skills to do so where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking that into consideration when
picking your techniques or your food,
[SPEAKER_00]: this will all kind of line in with
plugging in how you're going to have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backing up to seeds real quick,
talk about quality seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: A place that I like to get my vegetable
seeds from is Baker Creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple ladybock choy, got some butter
crunch lettuce, some bullnose peppers,
[SPEAKER_01]: some madhus ras.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sweet melon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, really good place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's one of the more popular places
when it comes to like vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have flower seeds there as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, might be a place that you want
to check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you have any sources of
vegetable seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally get, when I do get seeds,
a lot of our seeds are actually from
[SPEAKER_00]: because we have a routine coming at our
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a lot of our seeds from the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dill, we have our dill seeds from
last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my basil seeds from last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I go into further in the
presentation, we'll kind of plant those
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds of how you can do that if you want
to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of sources, if I do need
seeds, I tend to go to my local guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know if it's his brands
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like stopping in and getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, growing zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully most of you have seen this and
maybe some haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on most packets of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your growing zones is basically your
first and your last frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This for those who are listening,
there's a picture on the screen of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States and a packet of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows the US zones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are broken down, like I said,
on the first and last frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is this important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if this is all about your timing,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to start seeds indoors,
you want to try to have the best timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had timing guys where I've had
tomatoes indoors, and they end up being
[SPEAKER_00]: way too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't a lost cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I planted them sideways, underground and
the root system was amazing because that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole stem will grow roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a two foot tall plant laid down
sideways, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could have been prevented if I paid
more attention to my zone and timed it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out in Nevada and you can see like,
you have a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges, obviously, because you have
mountains and flatlands and foothills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm down on the southern tip there
actually in zone nine, which you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have listed there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 9A actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, desert region for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that goes to, you know,
what's going to be suited for your region
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that's, that's for in terms
of for planning and what crops may or may
[SPEAKER_00]: not be conducive.
[SPEAKER_00]: The planting cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into this very basic
planting, feeding, watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I kind of break this down,
I want you guys to think like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I need to plant it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do I need to plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And ask more in depth questions to
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So planting, know when your crop can be
planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of with plants that can be sowed in the
fall or in early spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the plants feeding demands?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you planting a plant that's heavy
feeding next to one that may not have as
[SPEAKER_00]: much of a fertilizer demand and causing an
access watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much do you need the, how much does
the individual crops need to be watered?
[SPEAKER_00]: If one type of plant requires high volumes
of water, you wouldn't want it by more
[SPEAKER_00]: sensitive plants that require less
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the potential harvest dates and
how to prepare for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the crop, it's at this time
that you can plant for a second harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't see the visual,
there's planting, feeding, watering and
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's aero cycling back around
because if you understand your timing of
[SPEAKER_00]: your planting and your, when you're going
to be harvesting, you can potentially sow
[SPEAKER_00]: in two or a third one, depending on the
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with harvesting, this is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvesting windows are especially
important when it comes to preserving for
[SPEAKER_00]: your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: To ensure longevity, you need the freshest
produce and the timing is everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we kind of go back to, okay,
I want to can, what do I want to can?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to plant tomatoes, but you have to
ask yourself what kind of tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you plant the variety that's
going to give you some tomatoes trickling
[SPEAKER_00]: in through the summer and into the fall,
you're probably not going to have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to be, to efficiently be able to can your
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to get the variety that you're
going to harvest most of them towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're picking the ripest and the
most of your harvest and then washing,
[SPEAKER_00]: prepping and canning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where your timing is
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, garden layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand the orientation of your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast, Southwest, you know,
where's the sun coming up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the sun coming down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to get the most sun?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't always the most important
thing, but most crops are going to require
[SPEAKER_00]: full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that are going to require
partial or more light amounts of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will parts of the garden have long
durations of shade?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this is not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small little tree that during
midsummer, it shades a portion of my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, but I'm able to plant in like
another row of lettuce and the heat of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun in the summer is not going to make it
go bitter because it's underneath the
[SPEAKER_00]: shading and it still gets enough light to
photosensitize and produce quality
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you growing plants that have low light
requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes to the same mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the requirements of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of keeps repeating in our
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you are you growing plants that have
low light requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're planting fruiting trees,
how big will they get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with annuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you see on the screen, this is
actually when me and my kids designed our
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and there's two apple trees and we
planted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we figure like eight years worth
of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how I prune them and how
big they're going to get, it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to shade that part of my garden where I'm
growing my vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in front of my garden,
you'll see four little circles and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: where we put our raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as of this year, that is a wall of
raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of knowing your plants and what
you're planting, I didn't have to spend
[SPEAKER_00]: all this money to fill it up the first
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought four mother plants and now
it's a complete wall and I can probably
[SPEAKER_00]: pull out 10 to 20, maybe more babies every
year and plant them around different parts
[SPEAKER_00]: of my land or give them the neighbors and
have them start their gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you use to make this?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest with you, this was some free
thing that I Googled online and people
[SPEAKER_00]: used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like how some websites do
grow logs where people can keep track of
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was one kind of that was free and a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't user friendly, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you know, working in paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a really cool concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it got enough for where, yeah,
this is my plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the back corner behind the shed,
you can see that that's the newer,
[SPEAKER_00]: the newer plot that we put in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last year we did potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we did all potatoes there last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people probably wondering
where that came from, because having a
[SPEAKER_01]: mapping tool through software seems like
it could definitely be valuable to map
[SPEAKER_01]: things out just like you show here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But never rule out the old notebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have notebooks filled of old
garden drawings and I go back to them to
[SPEAKER_00]: see my mindset, to see what I was
thinking, you know, and take this line,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what direction do you want to
plant your rose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone asked me, I personally
plant mine running north south because the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun is rising east west.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I plant normally my tomato plants will
can go on the would be the east side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, as the sun comes up and they're
not shading the plants of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the plants have their all day
sun and the bigger plants are not shading
[SPEAKER_00]: the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I do have other rows
that go east west, like my onions,
[SPEAKER_00]: my carrots, because they're just small and
the sun is there and they take it and
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing shades them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, these are things that you
can consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things fall under the bro science and
I don't matter which way you plant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, that's what you connect
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's move on to the next slide
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't try not to interrupt you as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you got quite a few slides left to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let you do your thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so the next one is growing media and
nutrient delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are having to do raise beds,
if you're on a deck patio, consider the
[SPEAKER_00]: differences between growing medias and
their water holding capacities when
[SPEAKER_00]: planting raise beds or planting in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just outlining organic soils,
pure peat moss, pure cocos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of goes into your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how much you're going to have to
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a soil that maybe holds
more water, it might be more conducive for
[SPEAKER_00]: your your lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're out at work and you come home,
they're not just wilted because they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: even make it that far into the day without
needing water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where knowing your soil,
the cohesions and stuff will help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, for your nutrient
delivery, we basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at it as we have organic dry
amendments, organic liquids, synthetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then synganics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry amendments are basically just
different forms, granular sizes,
[SPEAKER_00]: both materials and nature comes in many
reduced size forms, requires biology to
[SPEAKER_00]: break down organic liquids or,
you know, as the certifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics are just manmade ionic forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have synganics, synganics,
which is a blend of amendments and
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly, in my opinion, it seems like
people favor organics and they just use
[SPEAKER_00]: that little bit in between what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's important that you kind
of narrow end your methods so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't end up wasting a lot of money and
having a shelf filled with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your time when you're doing your
research and picking your delivery system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those listening, you can't see on
screen, but I have a picture of one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: family peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we cut it open, there's like a
perfect smiley face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wrote nature is always showing us how
happy it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're eating dinner and I cut it open
and I called the kids over and I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: see, we know we're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I showed it to them, you know,
and they're like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was it was one of those
moments where, you know, they really
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with their hard work,
you know, and they got to pick it and cut
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see how happy it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going into that, it's keep it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feel the need to incorporate all the
growing methods and techniques at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are not going to want to do all
techniques that are and that's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of said that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like composting and fermenting,
but I probably won't get into Jadam
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's try one new technique or new
fertilizer a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect with the visual responses that you
see and try to understand why it may have
[SPEAKER_00]: worked or why it may have not worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding too many things at once may lead to
compound issues and and or you not
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding why it worked or failed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, OK, well, what can I start
off with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, get a good basic all purpose for for
for see how your plants and your soils
[SPEAKER_00]: respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're kind of missing something,
pick it up, you know, but starting all
[SPEAKER_00]: these methods and OK, I'm going to do
fermenting in this and then use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, you have a petri dish
of and it's hard to go back once you do
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't compare your garden to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love what you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love what you have created and provided
within your means.
[SPEAKER_00]: All good things come with time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do this all the time as an artist,
as a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at other people's paintings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh God, but then I think to
myself, I'm not trying to paint that
[SPEAKER_00]: realism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to paint what I'm painting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes with the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see some beautiful gardens and
people that want to pick every weed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want those weeds in the ground in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have an advantage if I don't weed in
my garden, learn together, grow together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, if we all learn, we all learn
differently and we all have our own unique
[SPEAKER_00]: personalities and we need to bring this
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let your kids explore and find what sparks
their interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to say as adults, our attention
spans get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a 37 year old father, it's
definitely not better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes the same with your kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had this plan and planting and
doing all this stuff and they look up and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a butterfly flying away and
they're wandering off, support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't make it feel like it's a demand
where they have to do it as a chore and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2023.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have food rations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that economical demand where
they don't need that pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so young.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it fascinating and engaging for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Connect with neighbors and people from
your community.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be surprised in how many gardeners
are out there and you just might not have
[SPEAKER_00]: connected with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of social groups that are
geared towards your values and interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Define those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not every group is going to suit your
needs or their personalities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a part of some like JDOM ones just
to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are talking advanced stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, wow, it doesn't suit my
needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn to network, whether it's a farmer's
market on the side of the road stands,
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting with new people will help
expand your knowledge in your local
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And local knowledge for me is really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can go to your big box stores and
buy their vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times they might,
they have things that are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grow stuff and they send it to
these stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my Home Depot had lemon trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, okay, if I planted indoors,
maybe, but I can't have a lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to your local nursery and if
they're starting their vegetables from
[SPEAKER_00]: seed, you can bet they're picking the
heirlooms and the products that are grow
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow best in your region.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't be surprised if there are things
you never heard of where it's not a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: boy or badder boy or there's varieties of
tomatoes, but they have something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: more conducive for your zone and your
region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just gives you more success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to plant this fancy tomato,
but it might not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many hybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide is companion planting and it
kind of goes into what are you planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: That whole cycle we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And companion planting is when two plants
are grown near each other for the benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: of those plants or both so that the
benefits can be one way or mutual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes, it's not just, it could be
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a great example of this is I grew up
with put marigolds around everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you looked at pictures of old gardens,
there's marigolds around tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: To this day, I have tons of marigolds and
it was used as a bug deterrent and as a
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a flower can be a companion plant
because it's bringing in the pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs, the flies, the bees to hopefully
give you that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on screen, there's also a smaller
picture of what's called the three
[SPEAKER_00]: sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my kids are going to try this
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our one new thing we're trying
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically where you're going to
plant a corn in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to plant squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to plant squash around that
corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're also going to grow beans
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beans are going to use the corn as a
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The squash is going to keep the weeds at
bay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beans are going to bring nitrogen in
for the corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through this symbiotic relationships,
we get the benefits of the nitrogen being
[SPEAKER_00]: added by a plant, the cover crop by the
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the picture,
there's varying depths of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is another big great thing is the
variety gives you the root depths,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are going to access various parts of
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on where you're at,
this could be really important for not
[SPEAKER_00]: having to use so much fertilizer because
of the access of those roots, exudates and
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're bringing up towards your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that illustration there and the way
you broke that down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty easy to grasp onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the chart breaks it down basically and
shows you variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you plant corn, then you can do green
beans and cucumbers and peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, don't feel you need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are things you can connect with
and just further your knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last slide is just a little thing
that I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my quote.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no garden is too big nor too small.
[SPEAKER_00]: No man stands alone under the grace and
the open arms of Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: May she forgive, guide, bless and lead us
to the steward, the land for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love connecting with new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sharing my techniques and helping
them start their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really big in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think together in the communities,
this is the way we're going, where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: more self-aware of what's on the shelves
and what we do want as consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it starts with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts in your backyard, starts in a
pot on your patio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, it's just years of growth
and amazing food, amazing food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this last slide here with the
minerals, crystals and fossils.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this all about?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys want to follow me,
this is my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own unearthrocksandgems.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I sell fossils, rocks,
crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's anything you guys are
interested in, make sure to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hit me up on Instagram,
DaveMond31 or over on Facebook at
[SPEAKER_00]: unearthrocksandgems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always uploading new stuff,
recently trying some merch stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're into rock collecting,
crystals, fossils, definitely hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take care of you for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the presentation,
if you guys do decide to print it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a 100 word glossary with fun facts
and variations of things just to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are kind of goofy and some are
factual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll have things like different
types of hormone, plant hormones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and at the same time have boof in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure you check it out in the link.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a few questions for you in
regards to family gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I didn't send these to you in
advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are off the cusp here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So introducing kids to gardening,
what age do you recommend to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're getting them involved,
what kind of tasks can they help out with
[SPEAKER_01]: to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing question.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as their diaper can put their butt
in the soil, they don't even have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: crawling yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple things like plastic shovels,
plastic rakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to use your senses and what's
going to keep the child safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't go wander off and leave them
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just letting them interact,
touch the soil, throw it in the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: get it on them, seeing the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visuals alone will keep them occupied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they get older, you can start
introducing responsibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, can you dig the hole?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they dig in and it's like,
ah, it's not deep enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, can you pull out the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look what we got to put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like, oh, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they dig a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my family, I was very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All my babies, we made all our own baby
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blending it and then freezing it in ice
cube trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a perfect, like when your babies
start eating solids, it's a perfect one
[SPEAKER_00]: serving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they get a little older,
you can give them two servings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you harvest your carrots,
you blend them up, make a puree,
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze them, bag them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your babies will never have to have
jarred food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when do they start?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want them not to be picky,
when they can first start eating solids,
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're outside, be really
expressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, whoa, look what we grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you just give them that
broccoli, they're going to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ew.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're like, oh my gosh,
we grew this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy cow, try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like, yeah, dad's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping yourself positively interactive
is what you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then do you have like a top three or
maybe top five plants that you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: is good for family gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: My top would have to be definitely
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because you can make sauces,
you can add them in salads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just endless possibilities with
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cucumbers are definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say, what would be the last
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Onions.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, onions are a key for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cook with onions every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need onions and they store very,
very, very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last question from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you balance like the time in the
garden versus family time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how often you actually going out to
your garden with your family and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: tasks and then making sure there's a good
balance, make sure they're not out there
[SPEAKER_01]: too much to where they're like kind of
getting sick of it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be that balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: The balance is basically as much as you
can, that you're willing to do and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to accomplish, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start feeling burnt out,
you're doing too much and it's not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be conducive for you and your family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing your crops, not biting off too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to think about a garden with
tomatoes and eggplants and cucumbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: onions and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have yet to understand how it
grows, your time management is not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you focus on a few things that you
could be good at, as that garden grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: and especially here in central Illinois,
in the central United States up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Illinois, once the plants are certain
size, they're naturally shading and
[SPEAKER_00]: weeding themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the amount of rain and stuff we get
here, it's very self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of have to plug in your
location and everything else too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no good answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't platform it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You miss stuff and... You just got to
figure it out, I guess, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have any final tips, any final
advice that you want to give people here
[SPEAKER_01]: before we wrap things up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it fun and don't let other people
stress you out and you'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be open to share your knowledge with
neighbors and friends and people because
[SPEAKER_00]: the more we learn, the more we're just
going to benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a garden will really help you connect
in ways that it's just unexplainable with
[SPEAKER_00]: the food and how you feel and the domino
effects that your kids will have
[SPEAKER_00]: connecting with their food, especially
with the issues with children,
[SPEAKER_00]: diabetes and stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very... To the point to where if you
can have your child connect early on in
[SPEAKER_00]: that age, it's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell the listeners how they can find
you and is there anything upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can follow me over on Facebook
at unearthrocksandgems.com or at
[SPEAKER_00]: unearthrocksandgems or my website at
unearthrocksandgems.com, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Mon 31.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of future projects, getting the
garden going, getting ready for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially doing some filming and other
varieties, but nothing too defined.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll definitely have a link to your
social media down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below.
