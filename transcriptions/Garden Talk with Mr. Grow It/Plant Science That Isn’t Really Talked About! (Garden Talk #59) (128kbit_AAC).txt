[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because after the sun comes out and the
plant starts photosynthesizing the stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes and all that good stuff,
so you really want to harness that early
[SPEAKER_01]: on in the day, like as early as possible
before sunrise as the sun is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important to get the most out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants require different things at
different phases of the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big thing is IMO or indigenous
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes have such a large factor in
soil and how it all works together,
[SPEAKER_01]: you realize that that's really more
important than supplementing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Natural farming inputs within this brew as
well and you're multiplying those microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: from your IMO into the water for 24 to 36
hours usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature knows what it's doing and we're
trying to observe and mimic that as much
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for those of you that
don't know me, my name is Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned into the
Garden Talk Podcast, this episode number
[SPEAKER_00]: 59.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I get to view Blue,
but some of you know him as Bluegrass
[SPEAKER_00]: Green Thumb on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 6 years and
grows plants such as moringa trees,
[SPEAKER_00]: comfrey, alfalfa, fruits, veggies,
and a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's big into the natural farming approach
and he's also big into plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about plant
science that isn't really taught or even
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to Patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening, all plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AAC Infinity for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over their Grow Tent,
which has a canvas density of 2000D,
[SPEAKER_00]: making them the thickest grow tent on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an aluminum plate that mounts your
controller to the grow tent with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof pass-through for cable routing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frame has 50% thicker steel poles and
carries two times more weight than the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coupon code MRGROWIT will get you a
discount on their products, and I'll leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link to their website down in the
description section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Spider Farmer for being a
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new grow light they released here in
2022 is the SE-1000W.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was designed specifically for those
of you who run CO2-80 grow space and
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to maximize the light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a 10-bar design for an even light
spread, pulls 1000W from the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and comes in at 2.9Î¼m per joule efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommended coverage area is 4 feet by
4 feet or 5 feet by 5 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use discount code MRGROWIT5 to save on all
Spider Farmer products, and I'll leave a

below.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Blue, but he goes
by Bluegrass Green Thumb on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stoked to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to get into a ton of
plant science that isn't really taught or
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a decent size list of things to
get into, and I think this episode is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to bring a lot of value to those of
you who are big into plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into some of the topics,
we have a pretty decent size list today
[SPEAKER_00]: that we can go through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe tell us a little bit about yourself
and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am Blue or Bluegrass Green Thumb on
Instagram and a couple other platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am an indoor gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown several plants in many
different scales, many different
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've managed large scale nurseries,
kind of been hands on with plants for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we said six or seven years now,
kind of on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farming and gardening and plants have been
in my life for as long as I can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandfather was a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a cattle farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did dairy and beef.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did tobacco, corn, you know,
kind of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has hands in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to be a part of that,
you know, sitting on the tobacco setter
[SPEAKER_01]: and helping plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailing hay, the whole nine, you know,
probably in the way more than actually
[SPEAKER_01]: helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's kind of been part of
me for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of resonates with my soul,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's really my background
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of shifting into more of an
educational front, teaching natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming techniques and teaching
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of shifting mindsets from
conventional ways into more sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel personally that it builds us as
human beings as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that the world might be
able to use some of that good energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that just our short conversation
that we've had through Instagram that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're really big into the sustainable
side of things and the natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what the suggestion for the
topics for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure we'll get into a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That relate to that.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's do, let's see, we have a long
list of topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, where do we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with, talk to us about
Nutrient Cycle Theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mostly what I do, it comes from Korean
natural farming is the methodology,
[SPEAKER_01]: the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the big philosophies within Korean
natural farming or KNF is the Nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: Cycle Theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this theory basically suggests that
your plants require different things at
[SPEAKER_01]: different phases of the plant's life,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So early in the seedling through
vegetative stage, it can require more
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crossover or transition phase requires
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like in the Korean philosophy is like
they compare it to a woman during
[SPEAKER_01]: pregnancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She craves something sour and so
phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the KNF inputs that we make is
water-soluble calcium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of, it feeds that sour craving,
so to speak, in that transition phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have your ripening phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it's, the theory is the right
nutrients and the right amount at the
[SPEAKER_01]: right time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the, sorry, within the KNF
system, we have all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs that are used at specific times,
at specific rates, and it all comes,
[SPEAKER_01]: plays into that Nutrient Cycle Theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned phosphoric acid,
and I want to kind of circle back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: really quick because that's something that
is, I mean, you mentioned you're using it
[SPEAKER_00]: in Korean natural farming, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use it as it's pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people are worried that
phosphoric acid, if they're using those pH
[SPEAKER_00]: down products, they're killing off
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of factors to play there,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, like in a living soil type
situation, there's a lot going on in there
[SPEAKER_01]: with microbiology and humus, humic acids,
fulvic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these things kind of create a
buffer within your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you're applying it in like
extreme amounts, it's not going to really
[SPEAKER_01]: affect much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now speaking in terms of like a sterile
grown meat, it's a medium that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: supplementing only like salt-based
nutrients and stuff with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't have enough experience or
research into that to say for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel comfortable that if I were to
apply something like that into my soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biology there is going to take care of
it and not going to cause issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know an area that you have a lot of
experience on and they really want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about is IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about IMO, what that
is, how you make it, so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so within Korean natural farming,
the big thing, the base of it all is IMO
[SPEAKER_01]: or indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll notice within KNF, like KNF,
there's a lot of abbreviations,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm going to try to reiterate these as
we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, IMO is indigenous
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people first get into Korean natural
farming, the first thing they want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: for is, well, how do I make my nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just kind of the standard
mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to figure out where I'm going to
get my nitrogen or my potassium or calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: from, which to a certain extent is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you realize that the microbes
have such a large factor in plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: general and soil and how it all works
together, you realize that that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: more important than supplementing
nutrients because look at the tallest
[SPEAKER_01]: trees in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the healthiest ecosystems in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's fertilizing them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going in and tilling those places?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's spraying them with pesticides?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody because nature takes care of
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It adapts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It overcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's evolution in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strong survive and they adapt,
overcome, and make things happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thought behind IMO is you want to
collect these microorganisms from these
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a really healthy,
thriving forest that hasn't been
[SPEAKER_01]: adulterated by man and you can find these
patches of leaves that have stacked over
[SPEAKER_01]: years and years and years under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can usually pull that away and find
life in abundance, visible fungal strands
[SPEAKER_01]: and little critters and crawlies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with IMO, we're collecting those guys
because those are the strong guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the guys that are going to do
our nutrient cycling, that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make our plants resistant to pests and
disease and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're collecting those and we put them
in a storage state or as my mentor Chris
[SPEAKER_01]: Trump says, cryo-freeze, you know,
kind of using the sci-fi term there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're mixing this collection on an
undercooked rice, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A simple food for the microbes to kind of
grow up into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after so many days, if you have a good
collection, you mix that with brown sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: and it makes it shelf stable, basically,
indefinitely if it's stored properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, we're multiplying
that out into larger substrates into
[SPEAKER_01]: different phases of the IMO process.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's IMO 1, which is the collection
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO 2, which is that cryo-freeze stage
where you mix it with brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO 3, we're growing those out onto a
substrate, usually a carbohydrate and a
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use rice bran, oats, crimped oats,
rolled oats for a carbohydrate source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then usually something like wood chips
or leaves or sticks from the backyard as
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon source for that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's IMO 3.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO 4 is when you take that and you
introduce that to your native soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of creating this social
gathering, so to speak, of the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: you've collected from these different
thriving ecosystems and marrying them with
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes in your soil that you're
growing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of getting everyone a check and
balance type situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's situated, sorted out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you inoculate your soil with this
IMO 4, everything's smooth and balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no shock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's confused and the plant is kind
of, oh, I'm stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's chaos going on in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so you're essentially applying
these big, strong microbes that have
[SPEAKER_01]: helped these forests and valleys and
mountain life thrive for so long,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're growing that out basically and
applying it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're creating a similar ecosystem in
your soil that your plants are growing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those microbes, for the most part,
take care of everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these other inputs are kind of just
supplementing those microbes to do certain
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make that IMO solution,
how long is it good for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to use it right away,
or can it sit on the shelf for a period of
[SPEAKER_00]: time, or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So IMO, that's another really cool thing
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get to IMO 2, if you just have
that collection mixed with brown sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can store that indefinitely in the
right conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want it to dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can take the serum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turns into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brown sugar kind of, through osmotic
pressure, pulls all the liquid out and
[SPEAKER_01]: stores it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix that liquid with water and
just water it in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most basic way to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, once you take its IMO 3, it gets 100
times better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an arbitrary number, but it gets a
lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO 3 also can be stored indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dry when it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just dry product that's inoculated,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with IMO 4, indefinitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to store it in something that is
breathable, like a burlap bag or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to store it outside in the
rain and nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain conditions it needs to
stay in, but you can use it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The IMO 3 and 4, you can top dress with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix it in your soil if you wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also make what's called liquid IMO
with any of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO 2, IMO 3, or 4.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like a compost tea,
but you are using some of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming inputs in this brew as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're multiplying those microbes from
your IMO into the water for 24 to 36
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, usually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply that to your soil and plants
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The liquid is what I was mainly referring
to because I actually had another guest
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about IMO pretty recently,
Green's Goddess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you might have actually watched
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had the liquid right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I didn't ask her,
is how long is that good for?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am pretty new to IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't created it myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's lots of listeners that are
in the same boat as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that take notes
during this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people ask for sources in
addition to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any books that you can
recommend, or websites, or any additional
[SPEAKER_00]: sources that you can recommend that people
can learn more about IMO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mentor was Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was the first person and the
first farmer in America to utilize these
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually had Master Cho who came up
with Korean natural farming back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually came to Hawaii where Chris
Trump was and taught him the process and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I've learned under him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to one of his in-person classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a lot of really, really great
videos on YouTube explaining each part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the process, how to collect IMO,
how to take it to the next steps,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other Korean natural farming
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a really great teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the opportunity to take one of
his in-person classes, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is hands-on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really truly learn it until you
experience it hands-on, done correctly
[SPEAKER_01]: because of olfactory senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see something and you know if it's
good or bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our memory with smell is pretty
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smell a good IMO pile one time,
but you're like, okay, you smell it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also with that, it's good to experience
those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands-on is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris Trump on YouTube, Eric Weiner or
Drake on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: He CGNF Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of resources there to dig
into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thing is hands-on training.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get a certified instructor
somewhere, I highly recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really great things to look into as
well, not specific to KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: The teaming with series.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a series of books, teaming with
microbes, teaming with fungi, teaming with
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeff Lohenfeld is the author.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does a really incredible job of
explaining a lot of this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific stuff in a way that most people
can make sense of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find myself still revisiting those books
frequently because I learn constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I go back, something else like,
oh, well, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think about it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend those things big time
if you're just getting into all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That teaming with microbes is actually on
audiobook now for anyone who is an
[SPEAKER_00]: audiobook person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was listening to it on a recent plane
ride that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely more advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a beginner just trying to get
into it, sure, go ahead, try, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of things will go over your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, it's definitely a lot of great
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets deep into the science on a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about input.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said there's a lot of misconceptions
about the different inputs that are used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different inputs that
people put into their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these misconceptions that you're
talking about on these different inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically to the KNF realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people first get involved,
again, they typically go for, where are my
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients coming from?
[SPEAKER_01]: They like to go towards the FPJs and FFJs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone wants to make a banana ferment
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, there's my bloom booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's my potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not exactly how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't go to the store and buy plant
material to ferment for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It defeats the purpose and I'll explain.
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ and FFJ are more of hormone enzyme
supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are microbe food as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work in a sense that they can trigger
the microbes in your soil to respond the
[SPEAKER_01]: way that they need to for the phase that
that plant is in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, going back to the nutritive cycle
theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're making an FPJ out of the shoot
tips of a fast growing plant in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative phase, you're kind of,
quote unquote, harnessing the energy from
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you apply that to your plant as a
foliar and in your soil, those microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be like, oh, this is what I
need to do in conjunction to or in
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with this plant to do what it
needs to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bring this nitrogen to the
plant or this or this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That consortium of microbes is going to
wake up basically and do what their role
[SPEAKER_01]: is in that plant's phase because the
microbes also change throughout the life
[SPEAKER_01]: of your plants too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a different
consortium of microbes in veg as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to light bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: These FPJs and FFJs, they kind of feed and
wake up those microbes, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: to do what they need to do for that
plant's phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ is not a nitrogen input.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nitrogen, your vegetative type feed
comes from FAA or fish amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're applying these nutrients,
you should also be applying them with
[SPEAKER_01]: these other inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another big misconception is,
well, I'm just going to spray my plant
[SPEAKER_01]: with FPJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't want to do that because
then you're applying just a bunch of sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: to the leaves of your plants basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really setting up a buffet for
pests at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're applying, let's say,
FAA in veg, you want to do a foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nutrient input should also be applied
with what is called maintenance solution
[SPEAKER_01]: by some or SOS solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, that is a combination of FPJ,
fermented plant juice, BRV or brown rice
[SPEAKER_01]: vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any organic vinegar will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just don't use white distilled vinegar and
OHN or oriental herbal nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these inputs in this maintenance
solution actually work together in a
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vinegar, it actually acts as a
cleanser.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can help with pests and diseases,
but what's really cool about it is it can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually act as a catalyst for whatever
you're spraying on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vinegar itself can, like the amino
acids and stuff, and it can attach to
[SPEAKER_01]: these nutrients and compounds and make
them smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically make the water molecule smaller
so that it can enter the plant stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: easier and get more out of it basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of benefits to having all
this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: OHN, it has warming or invigorating
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's anti-pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a prebiotic basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the FPJ in there is steering the
microbes to do what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're applying FAA for veg,
you want to wake up those microbes for the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to apply any of these
inputs by themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maintenance solution is pretty much
applied with every nutrient input within
[SPEAKER_01]: the can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned how some of these inputs can
trigger hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get deeper into hormones because
that's something that we haven't really
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about much on this podcast in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about hormones,
what you know, why they're important,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a deep one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plants have plant growth hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of like natural PGRs so to
speak, but they're naturally produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of what the plant does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have different things like auxin,
gibberellins, cytokinin, abscic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each one of these hormones plays a
specific role within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, auxin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auxin is known for the elongation or shoot
growth basically, apical dominance of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auxin, it kind of promotes apical growth
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cell elongation is a technical term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of shoots up and it can help with
root growth as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: One majorly known auxin is indole acidic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's naturally produced in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go look at a lot of the rooting
hormone supplements, your gels and dips
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that, you'll see
indole-3-butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, all that is is a synthesized
version of this auxin that is naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been isolated and you're basically
applying this auxin to your plant to help
[SPEAKER_01]: promote rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with FPJ, that's a lot of what we're
harnessing when we make those ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tie all this together now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make FPJ, one of the
characteristics or one of the things you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be mindful of is when you collect
the material to make it out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's done before sunrise.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people kind of ignore that
especially in the beginning because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really see why.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I just need the nutrients out
of the plants, leaves or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have circadian rhythms just like
humans do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever noticed your plants when
the lights come on or the sun comes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're usually, they start to,
they pray up and they look happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as you get closer to those lights
turning off or the sun going down,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might start drooping down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of the plant in a sense
waking up and going to sleep with that
[SPEAKER_01]: circadian rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with these hormones, things like
auxin, in the morning time, as the sun's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting ready to come up, these plants are
expecting these lights to come on or the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun to come up because of the circadian
rhythm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take that energy and they shoot it to
the plant's tips, get ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesize for the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take all this in and do
their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hormones are going to be in the
highest concentration at the tips of these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants at that time in the morning because
after the sun comes out and the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: starts photosynthesizing, the stomata
close and all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to harness that early
on in the day, like as early as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: before sunrise, as the sun is coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very important to get the most out
of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these hormones play such a huge
role in the benefits of all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The auxin, again, it'll sell elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll make the plant basically grow
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has that energy that you harvested from
that plant and you're playing it to yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to make it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got your gibberlings,
your cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all play a different role.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cause branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cause cell division.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like actually producing plant,
basically, your leaves, your stems and
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're harnessing all that from
whatever you're making your FPJ or FFJ out
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you also want to harvest your plant
material based on the phase that that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to take a plant that is
blooming or fruiting and make a ferment
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that and apply it in the vegetative
phase because that balance of hormones is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be way off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With the way these, they all kind of work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You change the ratios a little bit between
these hormones and it'll cause your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to do all kinds of crazy things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just with tests and trials, I've tried
some of these inputs intentionally wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: just to see what kind of results would
happen out of my own curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's extremely powerful stuff,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: These inputs are very, very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is important to do it correctly in
order to get the results that you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you can get enhanced growth,
better root development.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are enzymes within the FPJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: They play all sorts of roles in breaking
down nutrients and taking care of pest
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and powdery mildew, fungal
diseases, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned PGRs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a common one that people talk
about a lot is, and I have trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: pronouncing it, but plactrobutrazole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know anything about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one of the ones that are
highly frowned upon if people use it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I believe it contributes to
cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it a link to cancer or something like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any info on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's definitely a carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made for ornamental plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not consumable plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right off the bat, that should tell you
not to use it on something that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to ingest in any way, shape,
or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a synthetic plant growth
regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, I believe what it does is
it inhibits gibberellic acid production
[SPEAKER_01]: within the plant so that, see,
gibberellic acid is another cell
[SPEAKER_01]: elongation hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of makes things shoot out,
grow tall, big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your stem, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It promotes that growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you block those hormones from
being able to function, the plant stays
[SPEAKER_01]: squat short.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't grow as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sends more of that energy through
other hormones and sends those nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: to the other parts of the plants,
like floral development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can make them more compact,
denser, heavier weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really messes up a lot of other
things, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many other options out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even within K&F, a lot of these inputs can
kind of promote similar type results
[SPEAKER_01]: without putting your plant through that,
without putting toxins into your plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: little body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you mentioned is a
real compact, dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what it's mostly known for
is people will receive this bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it will be super compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, why can't I grow my plants to be
this dense of buds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's unnatural, and it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm glad you expanded on that a
little bit and let us know exactly what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in the plant and why it's bad and
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know about enzymes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I won't say quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I surface level a lot of it, but enough to
kind of talk about it, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes play a very important role in all
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbes produce enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, you've got this big
consortium of all these different
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, fungi, yeast, and they all do a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may work in conjunction with each
other or whatever, but they'll excrete
[SPEAKER_01]: these enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what these enzymes do, basically,
is break down a certain thing and make it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a plant available form, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the big things right now is like
soybeans, soybean amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is an incredible input.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that complete amino acid profile,
it has all these precursors to different
[SPEAKER_01]: plant functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the ways that that is made is by
taking enzymes and converting the high
[SPEAKER_01]: protein content within the soybeans into
available amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some enzymes that are responsible for
that process are things like papain,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the milky latex substance that
comes out of a skin of an unripe papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you find a green papaya and just scrape
your finger across the skin, you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: this white, oozy stuff come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's papain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a protein digesting enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look into gut health supplements,
digestive enzymes, or probiotic,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times you'll see papain in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or bromelain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bromelain is found in pineapples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another protein digester.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically what they'll do is they'll
take these soybeans and they'll add these
[SPEAKER_01]: protein digesting enzymes to break down
the protein into amino acids, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: then readily available for the plant to
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with like fermentation and things
going on within the soil, a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: similar types of enzymes are being
produced to break down different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's, you know, proteins or
carbohydrates and fats or whatever it may
[SPEAKER_01]: be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more diverse and abundant your soil
biology is, the more of these enzymes are
[SPEAKER_01]: being excreted.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them are responsible for like
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take care of pests too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're spraying your whole plant,
your grow area and everything with liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO, and these microbes are kind of living
everywhere on the surfaces of everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got all that action going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got photosynthetic bacteria on the
leaf surface that are converting nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: from the air, making it available to your
plant right on the leaf surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So enzymes play a very important role in
making things available to our plants
[SPEAKER_01]: basically from just organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plays a huge role in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that there's some
bacteria that can actually take nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: from the air, convert it, and then the
plant intakes it through the stomata?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photosynthetic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like legumes, you know,
soybeans or clover, they actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: these microbes that can convert nitrogen
that is available in the soil or air into
[SPEAKER_01]: a form that is available for plants to
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that comes from the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use clover right now as a cover crop and
I've heard it's good for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from my understanding, the plant would
create it and release it into the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that incorrect?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a symbiotic relationship,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this kind of works in symbiosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't have one without the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like baking a cake and taking out one
ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you end up with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually not cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, it kind of works in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant can photosynthesize and take
nitrogen from the air and it shoots
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates down and has a relationship with
these microbes and the exchange that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: on and takes place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the mycorrhizal fungi are like,
oh, there's free nitrogen over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plant says it needs nitrogen,
so I'm going to pull it from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: From over here back up to the plant in
exchange for that plant's exudates or food
[SPEAKER_01]: for me or whatever I may need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel, in your opinion, clover is
beneficial in both large operations as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as small operations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've used clover in small grill pots
before and somebody said, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really doing anything for your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be in a large pot or you need
to be outdoors and use clover and have
[SPEAKER_00]: that by your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different situations are different,
but there are benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are benefits that you could still
gain even if you're not getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen fixation like we're talking
about, such as having that mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a living mulch basically,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So another very important thing within all
this is microbial development and fungi in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have a cover crop that is an
inch to three inches growing above the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface of your soil, you've got this
micro environment basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that area, and if you've got a top
dress like amendments or a mulch or
[SPEAKER_01]: something there, you've got this perfect
environment for these fungi and bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: to come into and do what they need to do
to break down this organic matter quicker
[SPEAKER_01]: for you and to thrive and populate,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you just have bare soil on top
of the lights that you're baking down on,
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys don't want to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that moisture to stay consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that environment to stay
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A general rule of thumb is 70% shade,
30% light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like the perfect little
environment or climate for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting benefits like that for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it grows and you're chopping it
down, you're reintroducing organic matter
[SPEAKER_01]: into your soil, which is nutrients,
which is micro food, which is eventually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to turn in the humus and organic
acids that can act as chelators or make
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients available to your plants,
add carbon, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's definitely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that you really want to make
sure that you have your biology on point
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going to utilize something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had situations where things like
clover and cover crops can actually be an
[SPEAKER_01]: attractant for pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can actually bring things into the
garden because even if your plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing is healthy and thriving,
if these clover down here aren't exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving, then you've got a buffet because
pests go after weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're weaker plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easier to penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're easier to get nutrients out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something to be mindful of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye on it at the very least for
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it as much as you look at whatever
main plant that you're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be observant in all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Observation is key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another concern for people is that
cover crops, it's often said that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: robbing nutrients from your main plant
that you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a concern at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: For cover crops to rob nutrients or use up
nutrients that your main plant is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need at some point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really a major concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoors, it might be a little bit
different, but it shouldn't be to an
[SPEAKER_01]: extent that you're noticing observable
effect or impact from it, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're mending your soil properly or
supplying your plant with these different
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs that are nutritive inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see it being that big of an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have experience side by side
testing it or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't link you to any studies by any
means, but just using the logic that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have, I don't think that that is as big of
an issue as people make it out to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, we want to talk about
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's one thing on your list that
you want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to explain to everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is more known knowledge,
but it still probably needs to be brought
[SPEAKER_01]: to the attention of more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do really revolves
around how things happen in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big nature observer because nature
knows what it's doing and we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: observe and mimic that as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went down a rabbit hole years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do hermaphrodites happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What it comes down to is survival,
just like every other plant response
[SPEAKER_01]: basically is some sort of means of a
survival response or a stress response.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a plant is growing in the wild,
its major intention is to reproduce just
[SPEAKER_01]: like all other species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to grow up, be healthy,
reproduce so that my genes can carry on
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a situation that a plant isn't in ideal
situations and it has factors that stress
[SPEAKER_01]: it or make it think that its life is
coming to an end or it might not make it
[SPEAKER_01]: out on the other side or it's not been
pollinated, it can produce these different
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios of hormones within itself basically
as a result of a stress response like a
[SPEAKER_01]: last minute resort basically to reproduce
and carry on the next generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That for one is something that just think
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermaphrodites don't necessarily mean that
the plant itself is inferior.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the mindset that we have is
like, oh, those are weak genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be looking at it all wrong like,
oh, this plant has the ability to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: it is intended to do in nature really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about perspective in that sense,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do grow for production and stuff like
that and that can hurt our final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think that that mentality in
general and that looking at it that way
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It changed some things for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking at something as being
inferior.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a lot of people, they get bashed
over that I found a hermaphrodite in this
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's the only one out of a thousand
plants, but that breeder ain't doing his
[SPEAKER_01]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is nature we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant's trying to survive and you've
got it in a situation it doesn't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Taking that knowledge and thinking about
the particular genetics that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, if you've got a land race variety
of a plant from somewhere, let's say close
[SPEAKER_01]: to the equator, and you put it in a
situation where its environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: its light schedule, temperatures,
humidity, the microbiology is so
[SPEAKER_01]: drastically different from where it
originates from, what do you think the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's response is going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Stress, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to factor, what kind of climate is
my indoor area?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of genetics do I need to be
aiming for?
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, did this particular combination
of varieties, would it prefer shorter days
[SPEAKER_01]: or hotter temperature or more or less
humidity, drier soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of soil consistency?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certain things you can do to get
close, but again, observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think through, how does this happen in
nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn a lot from that that applies
to more things than you realize,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished a cultivation certificate
at Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's by Dr. Bruce Bugbee, Royal Hines,
Mitch West-Warland, a lot of guys that are
[SPEAKER_00]: deep into the science of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One section they had was on
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're saying is there's no,
how do I word this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like inconclusive at the
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They feel it has to do with exactly what
you said, genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a genetic factor into it and
there's a stress factor into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the two main things,
but they're still continuing to study
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned on Instagram that some
KNF supplements could potentially prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you expand on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so this is definitely not hard data
and I don't want anyone to take this as
[SPEAKER_01]: such.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is some trials that I plan to run in
the future and I want a few more people
[SPEAKER_01]: that get involved so we can have some more
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to using these inputs as
hormone supplements, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got a plant in the transition
phase, in the reproductive ripening phase,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using these fermented plant inputs
for that phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a theory that if you had a
particular plant that was prone to
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing pollen sacks or bananas or
whatever you want to call it, if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement that plant with the right
ratios of hormones that the plant needs in
[SPEAKER_01]: that phase to do what it needs to do,
that it might prevent it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From shifting its own hormones into,
oh, I need to change my stuff up to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate myself to carry on my
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of acting as like a precursor,
so to speak, to doing what the plant you
[SPEAKER_01]: want the plant to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop steering in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know these are bold statements and
bold words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably going to get blown up for
this one, but it is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: interests me and I think there might be
something to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to play with that and see what
we can come up with there because that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a natural alternative or solution
to some of these headaches that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with and it might make it more
enticing for people to really dig into the
[SPEAKER_01]: realm of natural farming too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get that win, then that's a
win for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really interesting and I'm
definitely glad that you're digging down
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that clearly interests you
and you're taking action to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment and figure things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of odd.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the topic?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some people that don't
believe in epigenetic drift, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us what you know about
epigenetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not super scientific about it,
but there are certain factors that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: noticed firsthand, in particular with
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that, well, and you know,
cuttings, clones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a variety that has been
especially for multiple generations
[SPEAKER_01]: developed in a living soil situation with
a robust microbiology, proper nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that stuff in the right
conditions, it's healthy, it's thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thought is that the next generation,
the seed, is going to carry a lot of that
[SPEAKER_01]: information so that it's ready to respond
to a similar situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of thinking back to taking a
land-race equatorial strain and growing it
[SPEAKER_01]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: That seed, it knows what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's within its DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that a lot of this tech kind
of plays into that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a variety or a clone that is
used to growing and being produced in a
[SPEAKER_01]: sterile situation and then you throw it
into a bed that's had IMO4 inoculated into
[SPEAKER_01]: it for the last 10 years, it might freak
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not do good at all and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of my strains that I've developed have
been developed in living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you throw those into a sterile
salt-based type situation, I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee they're going to do real great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gotten seeds from many different
breeders and I do everything pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've experimented with salts and different
things just out of curiosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have noticed that the breeders I get
from that practice similar methods as
[SPEAKER_01]: myself tend to do a lot better right from
the get-go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You notice it even from the seeds
sprouting out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just tend to be more vigorous and
robust and happy, healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have as much damping off or
stress issues and they just generally
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually, I did a phenol hunt of
50 seeds and there were like five seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and all from different breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one that was strictly
salt-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grower, breeder, and that was the only
strain that none of them made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could have been several factors
involved there for sure, but I just
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that was interesting too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what interests me and what I
think about as far as epigenetics is
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get into genetic drift and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to be blown up for my
thoughts on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are getting towards the end of the
podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming on Blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely dropped some good knowledge
bombs of some science that isn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about much or taught about much
like you had mentioned to me through
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, tell us how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Instagram as Bluegrass Green Thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually probably the first time
that 98% of the people that follow me on
[SPEAKER_01]: there will actually see me or hear my
voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hey y'all, this is Blue, it's your boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, find me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a Patreon rolling officially
finally now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Discord set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing some exclusive content,
tutorials, breakdowns, stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a really great community there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come hang out with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really my main things right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I've been kind of behind the scenes
for many years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're getting things rolling in towards
this educational direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look forward to hearing from you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is this a face reveal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor to have your face revealed
on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all very important stuff to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I'm very passionate about,
very passionate about spreading and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting other people involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having this kind of platform and
opportunity to talk about it and spread
[SPEAKER_01]: some information is really huge to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on and sharing.
