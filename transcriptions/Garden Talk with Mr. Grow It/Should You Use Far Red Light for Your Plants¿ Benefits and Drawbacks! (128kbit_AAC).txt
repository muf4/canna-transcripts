[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about far-red light,
specifically between 700 and 750
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it do to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, is it worth supplementing
far-red light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do most grow lights have enough far-red
that it's not worth supplementing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is something I've been hearing
about for 10 years, but once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: still is ever-evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recorded an episode of the Jug Dealers
podcast the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I happen to know, once again,
I've been in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched certain people use far-red to
effective results for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm talking with these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's Jaren and Gabe, two of my most
respected grow brains in all the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both look me in the eye and
they're like, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, bro, well, I was like,
I thought they were going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, of course, they have flower
initiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, it doesn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exist in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this goes deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those controversial things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the red and there's the UV we'll
get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be not since organic versus
synthetic have we had as much debate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as the far-red, some people
can be confused right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should probably clarify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned the red earlier as the IR,
the infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when, as Gro mentioned,
the PAR, when you see a PAR chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what does a plant see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it like the vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the visual spectrum of a human,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see X-rays and gamma rays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see microwaves and radio waves,
but we see visible light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same sort of thing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a visual spectrum that it can
see, but just the same way as X-rays sure
[SPEAKER_01]: as hell affect us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're bombarded with them, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things outside of the PAR range also
affect the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so infrared is outside of that PAR
range, way outside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, like I said, that's why it's
interesting to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's outside of PAR, yet it still does
affect the metabolism of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also, that's infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're discussing far-red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is slightly on the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just dipping over the side of the PAR
range, a little bit in, a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does quite a bit of sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of negative stuff as well as
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main things that I think,
as I can speak, is there's not a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: science out there as far as this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it's a lot of the companies,
and I trust a lot of the companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane from My Grow, I trust this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain characters out there,
Jair from the Dutch Lighting Innovations,
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when these guys say things,
I listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can start with the negative sort
of effects that the far-red will have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far-red is just like, if you can think,
the reason that X-rays are so powerful is
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a really small wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I want to make something jiggle
fast, I got to put a lot of energy with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so versus a radio wave, it's this
giant, huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can wrap over your house and still get
a signal on the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if I shot an X-ray burst at your
house, it's going to hit the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too small of a wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can think of the far-red kind
of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can get past your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get past your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get down lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a forest and you've got a
bunch of trees, that are shading out a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, a little plant that's trying to
grow down there, our little favorite high
[SPEAKER_01]: valued plants that we like to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we put that underneath a giant forest
canopy, it's not going to get any of that
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious par that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it is going to get is some of
that far-red because it can get through
[SPEAKER_01]: the canopy and it still hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that tells the plant is stretch,
baby, stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not getting any of the yummy light
that we need to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting all that red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that there's light above
us, but we ain't getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to grow up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I've seen a lot
is people that will use their far-red
[SPEAKER_01]: lights all cycle is that they're getting a
lot of stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people like the stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an interesting thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the Five Eight Jug Dealers,
guys, we like to say it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: think of like a bloom booster,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an additive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to get you farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of like these UV, the far-red,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the additives that we're adding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some genetics need more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some need less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some genetics, some cultivars,
as we're now calling them, or probably
[SPEAKER_01]: should have always been calling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains are for mushrooms and flus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivars are for plants, just to clear up
any.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still call it strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a snicker puss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk down to someone because they
say strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these cultivars, they need
more than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you've got like these little
tiny squat plants that you want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: up, maybe you have techniques for
increasing that internodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things, the reasons we don't
like stretching is because it takes no to
[SPEAKER_01]: no of those flower sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get these giant tap-heavy
things that want to bend and break,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're having to give them more
silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way they have a little bit more
elasticity to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything just gets changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're one of these high-level
thinking growers, like my buddy from
[SPEAKER_01]: Three's Genetics, Jay Les Monster,
he's one of the best breeders in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, I run my far-red
mid-cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a little stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll grow this kernel chem that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some of it sitting over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, it's too squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nodes are too together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get bud mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I would have never thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, maybe this guy wants stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause he's getting botrytis at the end of
his harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, this loosens up some of those
tight flower sites and those, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing I would have been
like, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could say your dad's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't stretching is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not if that's exactly what you want to
keep your plants that keep you happy and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, happy and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the positive side of it is the
flower initiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, my friends have legit been doing
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think of it just like I talked
about with how red are these big giant
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before our eyes can actually see the
sunrise, we're actually starting to get
[SPEAKER_01]: bombarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it starts to heat up a little
bit before the sun even comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting hit with that IR first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the biggest it's coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cooking up our atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that far-red is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though the sun hasn't crested
the horizon yet, it's still throwing some
[SPEAKER_01]: of that far-red that our eyes can't
necessarily see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants can, and that tells them to
wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same conversely when the sun starts to go
down, it crosses the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all that visible light is blocked
by the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet some of that red is still so big,
just like the X-rays hitting your house
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the radio hitting your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit the radio in a big city,
even though it's blocked, your plant sees,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, there's that outgoing red,
time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have called this the flower
initiator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll run it for 50 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 minutes before your lights turn on,
and 15 minutes after your lights turn on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tells them that it is fully time to
wake up and fully time to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will go, it takes your plants,
you know, an hour to... So once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar-specific, some plants go to sleep
very, very fast and some other take
[SPEAKER_01]: forever, just like people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like life is like life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so much like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost spooky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it will tell them wake up,
go to bed, and they go faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so they're able to produce sugars
and oxens at night and interchange with
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots, the roots and the shoots,
as we call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both are doing different roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's creating oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: People always think that the plants,
well, they create CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did you know the roots create
oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why terrariums can exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew my mind when I started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a plant in a sealed bottle and
it will live because its roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing oxygen and the flowers are
producing CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can circulate through the tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you start shortening those days
or not shortening your days, but getting
[SPEAKER_01]: them to go to sleep faster, you're
actually day after day in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a 60 to 80 day flower cycle, you're
actually pulling several days off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are saying, I'm pulling a week
off of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the point I try to make with Jaren
and Gabe on the junk dealer show is where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, no, it doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I think we're talking
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it does anything to increase
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna get more oil in those
vials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna get more COCs from this,
but you're taking time off of your
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more, I guess this could be lumped
into the yield category because if you can
[SPEAKER_01]: jam another harvest in your garden each
year, even if you're losing a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of weight run to run, you're gaining that
weight back plus by jamming a whole extra
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something we all can
get down with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are definitely pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like that con that you
mentioned is really subjective,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I had somebody on the podcast
pretty recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dave Baker, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on there talking about auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that was pretty interesting
is he actually uses the far red for auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he wants that stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants that veg growth to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he wants the biggest plan as he
possibly get in an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we all know that it's limited on
his timeframe for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It automatically flips to flower,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that veg timeframe is super,
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any stunt growth, you could
have a significantly smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he utilizes far red, supplements far
red in order to get a bigger stretch on
[SPEAKER_00]: his auto flowers before they actually
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what learning looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go, people ask questions like,
how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, cause someone smart told me at
once and I listened auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause exactly like I talked about it,
like getting bud rot and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually an outside, a outdoor sort
of thing, you know, but a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_01]: get it indoors and I could totally see you
get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That giant Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really top an auto flower the
way we would top a normal photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this giant Christmas tree cola
going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see totally increasing that
internodal length gives you more room for
[SPEAKER_01]: those buds to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tells them there's more space for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say it's worth adding in like
for people actually go out and buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to supplement, or is it just kind
of like a plant additive where you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it's kind of like an optional
thing and it'll take you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: further, but it might not be worth it for
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can type into Google, Google image
search at some point after this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone listening, just type a law of the
minimums chart or graphic, the law of the
[SPEAKER_01]: minimums, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take a barrel and it's all got
level sides, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fill the water up to that level of
the barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you take one plank of that barrel and
you hammer it down five inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the height of what that barrel can
contain is now its lowest point,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is going to flow out that hole
until it reaches to that equilibrium point
[SPEAKER_01]: of that lowest plank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your new water level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull that plank up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can fill it all the way back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Lee Bigg's law of the
minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never remember exactly the fella's
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned from college educated people yet
was not college educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a hard time retaining some of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a knowledge firehose out there these
days grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to maintain all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, look up law of the minimums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say for sure, we will say this
even about something as pedantic as CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it until everything else
is dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not hitting your DLI,
your preferred PPFD, you're not even going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to like, you're going to get,
that's another thing about giving it more
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this weird cause and effect loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about having CO2 if you don't
have enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then don't worry about putting more
light in if you don't have CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a weird, all monkeys are apes,
but not all apes are monkeys sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say for sure, just a short
answer to the question is yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it should be one of the last things you're
worrying about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have your room dialed in and
you're like, I don't know how I could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly make it any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the person that should be kind of
thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a new grower, you're buying
your first tent and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: should I buy some far red?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your light will contain enough to be
perfectly adequate.
