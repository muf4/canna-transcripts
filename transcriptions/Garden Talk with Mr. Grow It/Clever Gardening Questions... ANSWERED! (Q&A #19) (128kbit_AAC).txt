[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: tuned into one of my Q&A videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I film these Q&A videos live on Twitch
every single month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me on Twitch if you want to ask
questions and potentially be featured in a
[SPEAKER_00]: future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitch.tv slash MrGrowit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you follow and turn on
notifications so that way you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: notified when I go live next.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, let's get into today's Q
&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a 284 dry amendment for mid to
late flower in an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything you would suggest adding
silica?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend people add in silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice hulls is just a fantastic way to get
silica in your plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many, many benefits with silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not using silica,
I think everybody should be having silica
[SPEAKER_00]: in their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not using like mycorrhizal fungi
or a microbial inoculant, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings are fantastic to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that should be in every organic
grow in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would go with those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any good grow light sales going
on right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sponsor of this episode, Mars Hydro,
has a sale on the FC and FCE series of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are bar style, so an even light
spread across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have removable bars, so you can
adjust them if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them connect to their smart
grow system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FCE series of grow lights uses
bridgelocked diodes and comes in at a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: lower of a price.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FC series of lights uses Samsung 301B
and the PPF comes in a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than the FCE series.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are good for home growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on the commercial side of
things, reach out to info at mars-hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: .com to get the best price possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: More information on that sale is on their
website, mars-hydro.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Link is in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use discount code MRGROWIT and
you'll get a bit higher percentage off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does your feeding process look like,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing nutrients in a specific order?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on if I'm using,
you know, synthetic bottled nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm growing organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break down both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start with the organic, a little bit
easier in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I like to run organic blends,
build a soil, craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Kiss Organics, their nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using it for the first time this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of them are very similar feeding
technique where you're literally just
[SPEAKER_00]: doing one cup per plant every 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I do a top dressing style for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past several grows, I've actually been
doing a nutrient well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke about that a little bit on my last
Q and A, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also my main channel video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just dig down a little bit of a hole in
there and put the nutrients in that one
[SPEAKER_00]: spot, bury it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's an additional way instead
of just doing the, spreading out the top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: All along the grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people will kind of mix it
in with that top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people will put an additional layer
of soil on top of that top dressing and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kind of water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it all those ways before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this past couple of grows,
I've been doing that nutrient well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the downside about the nutrient well
technique is a lot of people complain that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're disturbing the root zone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of digging down into the soil,
making space for the embedments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the theory downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh well, you're concentrating
nutrients in one part of the grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does that impact the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had really an issue where I saw
any deficiencies happening because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant wasn't able to get that nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutrient well is kind of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, organic feeding just one
cup per plant every 30 days for those ones
[SPEAKER_00]: in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done individual amendments before,
organic amendments, but I'm not a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I really recommend people try to
go in there and fumble around themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is oyster shell flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some of this in, alfalfa meal,
that's good for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dump this in, you know, you might be
able to get away with doing that without
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, but in the long-term, you can
have, can definitely have bad consequences
[SPEAKER_00]: on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can just be kind of an imbalance of
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients can lock out of the nutrients,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't recommend that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to the synthetic side of
things, I will always follow the feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: chart as far as the ratios to the
different bottles, but I always just about
[SPEAKER_00]: always start with a half dose,
sometimes even a quarter dose of nutrition
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll mix that up and to usually put it
into a five gallon bucket, however much
[SPEAKER_00]: water I need, then I'll put the nutrients
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The order I put them in, start with
silica, mix that in real well,
[SPEAKER_00]: then Cal Mag, then the grow fertilizer or
bloom fertilizer, whatever stage I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, I will pH adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll mix that up and then give it to my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically it'll be like every other
week typically is what it comes out to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do the water feed, water feed
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I water the girl pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the medium dries out,
I have a dry back in between waterings or
[SPEAKER_00]: feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the water would be a feed,
dries out, water dries out, feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very long winded answer on that one,
but there's plenty of details for you for
[SPEAKER_00]: how I do my feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a difference in the amount of
PPFD for autos and photos due to the extra
[SPEAKER_00]: time under the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for many, many years, a lot of us
kind of neglected that fact that autos
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to stay on a higher light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just been kind of generalized to
this much PPFD in seedling, this much PPFD
[SPEAKER_00]: in veg, this much PPFD in flowering and
really kind of neglected the photos versus
[SPEAKER_00]: autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will look at DLI is really what it comes
down to for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, if I have my plants in the
flowering stage for autos, I can still aim
[SPEAKER_00]: for that 600 to 900 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I might want to go more towards the
600 PPFD for a lower DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, CO2 is going to impact that as
well as far as how much light the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would kind of notch it down a
little bit, particularly in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely get away with 600,
700, 800 PPFD, particularly in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can still do the 200, 400 PPFD for
seedling, 400 to 600 PPFD for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good question because I
think a lot of people do it differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know how you do it in the comments
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best type of soil you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Easy question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I talk about the soil just so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Fox Farm Motion Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of what I've been born and
raised using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing back in 2010 and that's
the soil that I started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy actually who taught me how to
grow, he was using that along with the Fox
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just kind of stuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it at my local nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty good price.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's got enough nutrients to last me
the first 20 to 40 days of the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: life, depending on what size container
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to be my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have you made compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how often did you apply it to
your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've done compost teas before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have some content on compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not enough content, but I've been using
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used them in several grows,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use them just in flowering,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically it was more so using them
when I was growing organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe I did that top dressing before
or right at flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the first three,
four weeks or so, maybe I'm hitting them
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tea then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every couple of weeks after that
is usually when I would hit it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just up until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's primarily when I use teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like if I don't need to use
them, why use them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually the past three, four grows
now, I haven't had a need to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my plants have been healthy
throughout the entire bloom phase from
[SPEAKER_00]: using build a soil, craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other ones was kiss organics
nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke about a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using that this grow plants look
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm mid flowering coming up towards
the final weeks of flowering for some
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, several different cultivars that
I'm growing this round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be out really compost teas as
needed basis for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower progressive light schedule or
higher in the beginning, tapering off to
[SPEAKER_00]: mimic nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always just kind of been slowly
increasing the PPFD up until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the way I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I have done grows like years
ago, six plus years ago, where I would
[SPEAKER_00]: lower the wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was with HID lower it down for the
final one to two weeks in order to do
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done testing to kind of see if
there was a difference or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these past six plus years I've just
been doing just been doing full blast all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up until harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool if somebody did do testing on
that though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be really cool to see if there was
a difference growing from seeds or clones
[SPEAKER_00]: currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, I am growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got four different cultivars going
on right now that runs by homegrown Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got curb stomper.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my prism labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have?
[SPEAKER_00]: American pie by grow more fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I think has hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually recording footage about the
plant showing the plant why I think it has
[SPEAKER_00]: hoplite and viroid testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually taken samples and sent
off for testing waiting to hear back
[SPEAKER_00]: results on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hoplite and viroid, man,
it's got me so interested because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I'm sure a lot of us have
experienced and not known it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The symptoms on it are like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the symptoms are similar to other
deficiencies and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like one of the ones that I'm
experienced right now is the overlapping
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, like five finger leaves,
if the leaves kind of overlapping and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of curl in like that, that's a identifier
of a viroid hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's other ones it could be as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say that that's definitely
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from my understanding, that indicates
a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually have that for the first time
I think ever because I haven't noticed any
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's not really a trait I've been
looking for, but like that overlapping on
[SPEAKER_00]: every single leaf, it's just it's weird to
see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, I sent it off for testing and
we'll see what it comes back and see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's positive or negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just seeds as of right now and
everything's looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I'm also growing Hades Throne by
Zaza Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the four that I got going on
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had to kill off a hermy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one ended up flipping on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it looked freaking
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week three or I think it was three a
flower, two or three a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower development looking amazing and all
of a sudden ball sacks show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no bueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to kill that one off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still really sad about that,
to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any recommendations, techniques for older
seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the technique that I read in
Jorge Cervantes book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Growers Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you read that, you'll see that he has
like an interesting technique to where
[SPEAKER_00]: he's taking the seeds and have like a
piece of sandpaper to kind of rough up the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed a little bit or the side of like a
matchbox or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a rough area to kind of rough up
the side of the seed and then claims as it
[SPEAKER_00]: helps with germination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do that at your own risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I actually tried that before and
it didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your question reminds me of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now just kind of dropping them in
water, paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of the best ways I think of
checking to see whether or not your seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people have done special
solutions that they dip their seeds in or
[SPEAKER_00]: soak the seeds in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really familiar with some of those
those remedies that people have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment below if you have any little home
remedies of getting seeds to germinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of increasing those those chances
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever tried carbonated water for
a watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, probably not, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been using all real water and
that works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really feel the need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me personally, I don't think I'm ever
going to try that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's interesting for the folks
that do do things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear of your results if you do
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opinions on a new Vipa Spectra 1500 Pro
LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I'm running two of them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them in my two by four grow tent for
veg, real even light spread on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I switched them over to my four
by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them on half of my four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the new AC Infinity light,
the Evo three on the other side of my four
[SPEAKER_00]: by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like running two lights for like a
two by four grow space because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: that flexibility to kind of make light
distance kind of adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some plants growing bigger than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have them on one side of the tent
and raise them raise up that light and
[SPEAKER_00]: then keep the other light down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, oftentimes I will actually just,
you know, if I do have one light that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of goes across that whole two by four,
I'll just put a diagonal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know some people are against
doing that, but I've always been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been it's been helped making that
even light spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a power meter so I got to check
and make sure that things are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in to the PPFT that I want on the
plants at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that grow light is is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any complaints on it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think one thing that could be
improved on that is like the dimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like the dimmer switches how they
go from like, you know, 25 to 50,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just those particular set points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't adjust it like from zero to 100
to any percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing I don't like about
some grow lights have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm yeah, it's not small con.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say back in the day it was said
estrogen would make your plants female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are crushing up birth control
into the sea.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made me laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.
