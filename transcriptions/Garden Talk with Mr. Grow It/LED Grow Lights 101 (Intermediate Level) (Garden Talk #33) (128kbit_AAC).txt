[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had 100 UVA photons, for example,
and 100 blue photons, the UVA photons
[SPEAKER_01]: would only be about 20% as effective as
the blue photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tested maybe 100 grow lights in the
last two or three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen one whose spectrum wasn't
suitable for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hack to getting at the equivalent
of a $300 quantum sensor per meter for
[SPEAKER_01]: about $20, $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compared to blue and green, red photons
are more photosynthetically efficient by
[SPEAKER_01]: about 10 or 15%.
[SPEAKER_01]: People see the blues and the UVs and the
far reds and these extra diodes and think
[SPEAKER_01]: they add something.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I see is waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see money being put into stuff,
which is just marketing trinkets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want more growth, get more
power.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Shane from My Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really delighted to be on your
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dive deep into lighting
today, particularly lighting for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually already did a lighting in a
past podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called Things to Look For When
Buying an LED Grow Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really an LED grow light buyer's
guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more of a beginner friendly
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was episode 18 with Austin from
Chilltech.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you want to check it out,
I'll actually have that in the outro card
[SPEAKER_00]: of this video if you're watching on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this conversation is going to be more
intermediate knowledge, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into grow light
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about measuring PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go over the different colors on
the spectrum and how they impact plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the future of LED grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into the nitty gritty of
things, can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been into growing for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So horticultural background, horticultural
parents.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife is into horticulture and I'm an
engineer, manufacturing engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finished up with my previous job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working corporate, finished up and
wanted to look into doing something
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of put two and two together and
came up with MIGRO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So MIGRO, we managed to manufacture and
sell our own range of grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as well, of course, we have the MIGRO
YouTube channel and Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I've been running that for about
the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you currently have, you're coming up
on 70,000 subscribers on your YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congrats to all your success there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on your YouTube channel, you do a lot
of grow light testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the grow light
testing you do and how you measure grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light performance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I originally started doing grow light
testing basically to sell my own lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was to to demonstrate the value of
buying high efficiency lights over what a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the sort of cheaper models were
around at the time, particularly blurple
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about four or five years ago and
kind of came up with a not came up with,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sort of refined, I suppose,
a method of testing, which was getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow light in question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Optimizing it for in terms of the area
that it's suited for, optimizing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of hanging height, simulating a grow
tent environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silver mylar walls and then using
what's called a quantum sensor or a power
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor to measure across a grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you guys will be aware of power
maps, basically a chart showing the power
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity or the light intensity all
across the the sort of test area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which represents the plant canopy,
the leaf canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, yeah, it became very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: People really got got into seeing,
you know, how their light performed,
[SPEAKER_01]: how some lights perform against other
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess sort of demystifying as well
some of the confusion and the
[SPEAKER_01]: misconceptions around grow lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple of the measurements that you
highlighted seems are micro moles per watt
[SPEAKER_00]: and also the average par over the photo
print.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why are those measurements kind of the
most important, in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take, for example, a HID bulb as
a starting point, so a HPS bulb,
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS bulbs fire out light or photons in all
directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to then use reflectors and
reflective walls in order to direct that
[SPEAKER_01]: all that light back down onto the plant
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And often there are losses involved in
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the reflector isn't a good quality
reflector, if the hanging height isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: optimized, all these sort of things feed
into how much loss you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically with a HID reflector,
you've had anywhere between about 15 and
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 percent losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not just about the amount of
light that's coming out of the fixture
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This pertains to LED as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really it's about the system
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as I said, when you have it in the
correct grow light environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the right size, grow area with
reflective walls at the optimized height,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the best system efficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting that, how much power are you
getting down onto the plant canopy?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then simply that's the so that's the
power output kind of called, we come to
[SPEAKER_01]: call it user power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usable PPF or usable power in the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's how much usable power or power
is reaching your plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you divide that by the power
consumed, you get the efficiency of the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the amount of output delivered to
your plants divided by the cost input in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives you sort of exactly the
correct term to say micro moles per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should really be micro moles per joule
joule of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a bit simpler and easier to
understand to say micro moles per per per
[SPEAKER_01]: watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's it's a found that people
really like having that simple reference
[SPEAKER_01]: point in the same way that if you're going
to buy a car, you'd want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: information on what the fuel economy is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many miles per gallon and even
performance wise, you know, to 60s and
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a simple reference point where you
can compare different technologies,
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of grow lights and have a
benchmark to compare them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question is very subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll say, in your opinion, what are
some things that people should look for
[SPEAKER_00]: when buying an LED grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the simplest thing is the size of your
grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to provide sufficient quantity
of light to get good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a function of the length by the
width.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the surface area that you're trying to
light, but also, as I said, is a function
[SPEAKER_01]: of the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the using reflective walls and having
the right reflectors are the right hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: height.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally, I'd recommend starting off
at five hundred micro moles per meter
[SPEAKER_01]: square per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a power intensity which will
deliver a good level of performance in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of the grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that can rise all the way up to eight,
nine hundred micro moles average power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will literally get, you know,
if you go from five hundred to nine
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred, you will get sort of forty,
forty five percent more growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the return on your light intensity
is linear up to about a thousand micro
[SPEAKER_01]: moles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond then, we recommend you can use
those higher intensities, but you will
[SPEAKER_01]: generally get plant stress unless you're
supplementing the environment with
[SPEAKER_01]: elevated CO2 or supplementing with CO2 and
elevating the CO2 levels in the grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lower levels I would recommend
for seedlings, so around two hundred to
[SPEAKER_01]: two fifty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you've established, you know,
do you want to really do you want to just
[SPEAKER_01]: have sort of a reasonable level of
performance out of the grow area,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be five hundred micro moles or
a high performance level, which would be
[SPEAKER_01]: eight or nine hundred micro moles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make that decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, usually I would recommend
learners or beginners would start at five
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred because you've got to really have
your all your other aspects of your grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment, the nutrients,
the medium, everything else on point to
[SPEAKER_01]: really take advantage of those higher
light levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've established that and then you're
trying to find a fixture which will
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver at that level in the grow area
size that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most manufacturers now these days publish
power maps, so they'll show the power
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity over the designed grow area and
they should give you the average micro
[SPEAKER_01]: moles over the grow area, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next step really is about efficiency and
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like most things in life, you know,
you can get what you pay for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pay for an entry light these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and by the way, the entry lights
generally these days are very good and
[SPEAKER_01]: they will be available in about in
efficiency terms, about two micro moles
[SPEAKER_01]: per watt in terms of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would pay somewhere in the region
of maybe a dollar twenty per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to get a hundred watt light
for a two by two and cost you about one
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred twenty, one hundred and thirty
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can go higher performance
than that with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe two point four micro moles
per watt, so twenty percent more
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, two point five even.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could pay 50 percent more per watt,
so maybe up to one point eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: two dollars a watt for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do get a return over time and you get
other benefits like lower heat input into
[SPEAKER_01]: your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's the sort of range
that you'd be operating in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one is spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know we're going to talk a lot about
spectrum later, but in general terms,
[SPEAKER_01]: most grow lights that I've seen and tested
around the market these days have a
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum which is totally suitable for
growing all the way from seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to be changing grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to be tweaking or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spectrums are particularly concerned
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, white LED lights will grow all
plant types perfectly well, all with good
[SPEAKER_01]: development, good shape, good structure
all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, your sites work out your
area, know your area, then find lights
[SPEAKER_01]: that are designed and suited for that
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then look at the power intensity that
they're designed for and decide where you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be on that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really, you'll find a range of
lights and usually there'll be a price
[SPEAKER_01]: range in line with performance for those
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things you actually didn't
mention, which can be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: surprising for some of the people watching
this, is you didn't talk about diodes or
[SPEAKER_00]: drivers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one thing that people look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first thing though, does it have
Samsung diodes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have Meanwhile drivers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're saying, you know, efficiency is
kind of more important in your opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, efficiency and is related to
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the drivers, higher efficiency drivers,
so most electronics burn out because of
[SPEAKER_01]: heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're running LEDs very hard,
so running them at a very high wattage per
[SPEAKER_01]: LED, so driving them hard, using a low
amount of LEDs to get a high quantity of
[SPEAKER_01]: light, and they will run hot, but they
will also run less efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly with the transformers or the LED
drivers, if they're of low quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be also generally of low
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher quality is achieved with better
quality components internally that are
[SPEAKER_01]: more accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they often have additional sort of
circuitry in the drivers to elevate the
[SPEAKER_01]: performance of the drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the driver and the LEDs combined will
deliver a high quality driver and LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: combined will deliver a high efficiency
and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of the LEDs themselves,
there is an obsession with Samsung.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do tend to be at the forefront in
terms of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the difference between Samsung,
the most expensive, and by the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll pay for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was saying earlier, you'll pay for it
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your Samsung drive systems,
your Soul semiconductors, which I use,
[SPEAKER_01]: your Osrams, Philips, Bridgelux,
all of these manufacturers make great
[SPEAKER_01]: chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're high volume, high quality,
long established manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the quality of their components and
the longevity of their components will be
[SPEAKER_01]: in line with Samsung's just as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is an obsession and I think it's
born out of people getting burnt excuse
[SPEAKER_01]: the pun, by poor specifications and poor
technology in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those days are largely gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still hear reports from people on some
of the lights that have tested that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they had some issues with,
for example, driver burnout and that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to say, the number of
complaints or the amount of feedback I've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten on that in the last couple of years
has reduced significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've seen less reports as well as
far as burnout of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days are somewhat over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can say, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look it up and let's talk about
measuring PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Apogee MQ500 PAR meter that
measures from 400 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have the MQ620, which is the
extended range one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures from 340 nanometers to 1040
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've recently found a PAR meter
that's a bit cheaper than the let's call
[SPEAKER_00]: it industry standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee meters, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just as accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was quite surprised myself because I
had looked in the past at getting an
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable quantum sensors and getting
alternative ones to the ones I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been using the Apogee myself for
about five years and I would think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much the benchmark of people using
it in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this measures PAR itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't actually read spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't tell you what the spectrum
looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's slightly different to spectral
radiometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the quantum sensor or PAR sensors are
designed to capture and count photons
[SPEAKER_01]: between 400 nanometers and 700 nanometers,
which is basically from a deep blue up to
[SPEAKER_01]: the far red, just to that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the PAR measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And good ones will measure all the photons
and all the wavelengths in that PAR range
[SPEAKER_01]: accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll count blue photons accurately and
red photons accurately.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other sensors around there which
are sort of anything you see that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be sub, say, $200 and is likely to be a
modified look sensor light meter,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is they're designed more for the
visible readings or readings of looks and
[SPEAKER_01]: lumens and not totally suitable for PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll give you slight errors
particularly in the deep blue and the far
[SPEAKER_01]: red areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did find, so I got a recommendation
actually from a viewer on one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked out this other sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was significantly cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Apogee SQ520, the PAR sensor,
I think with the display and the reading
[SPEAKER_01]: meter is about $500.
[SPEAKER_01]: $130 or thereabouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this spot on PAR sensor is $300.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little bit skeptical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it might be sort of a jumped up
looks meter, but I got in contact with
[SPEAKER_01]: them, got a hold of one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me one over for test and I
started testing in parallel with the two
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So doing my normal tests with the Apogee
and this spot on sensor beside each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found it to be, you know,
to a level of similarity where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'm not sure which one is more
accurate by the way, but they're both
[SPEAKER_01]: within any of the readings or series of
readings I took within a couple of percent
[SPEAKER_01]: of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was really impressed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought just from a, you know,
a community and an industry point of view,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a bit of a breakthrough for me
really, because a lot of people basically
[SPEAKER_01]: watch my channel really because they can't
afford a quantum sensor to find out the
[SPEAKER_01]: information that I'm going to tell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's great that the cost of
these things are coming down and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: becoming more accessible for the average
grower to do the things that I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to assess and optimize their grow
lighting setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to say that same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about time that these prices have
come down on PAR meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it is out of so many people's reach,
you know, $500.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of money for a lot of people,
you know, it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good that they're now at least one
cheaper option that's just as accurate as
[SPEAKER_00]: the Apple G meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is another one, Chris, which I know
we're going on to anyway, but I did
[SPEAKER_01]: publish some, so I did some testing of lux
meter accuracy with different spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get pretty close accuracy or
at least consistency in the measurements
[SPEAKER_01]: using a lux meter and then basically
apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these lux meters you can get anywhere
from $15, maybe up to about 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: $40.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much, much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found was that I did readings
under different spectrum from about 150
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles up to about 1100 micromoles,
which is about the full range that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be able to read that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found them to be linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using them under, say, for example,
I don't know, you could have a Mars Hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: SF 2000, or you could have a ViproSpectra
or you could have a ViproSpectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a Chill or whatever light
you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, these things will read
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're reading, you're still reading a
lux measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not par that we would want to
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on my channel, I've done a few videos
where I've given conversion measurements
[SPEAKER_01]: for typical grow light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most important thing is that it's
linear.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this means that you can map out your
grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find out the relative intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there hot spots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there cool spots?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also do your own power maps
and then optimize your own setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So repeat the testing of your power map in
your own area with your own light setup at
[SPEAKER_01]: different hanging heights, for example,
and find out which one gives you the best
[SPEAKER_01]: balance between getting the most light
down onto your grow area and the most even
[SPEAKER_01]: spread across your grow area at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do that for $20.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that's great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another cheap alternative is you can
actually, there are now phone apps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download a phone app and measure
par just using your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these apps are more accurate
than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did a whole video on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about your findings
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a bit of tech behind it in that
I use the Photon app.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not their new name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, they changed name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's to Photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's exclusively available on Apple
Store for using with Apple phones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the front facing camera on Apple,
they all have the same sensor and the same
[SPEAKER_01]: processing hardware and software for that
sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get consistent readings on any
iPhone with that app, whereas with
[SPEAKER_01]: Android, whether you have a Samsung or
some other version phone, and even within
[SPEAKER_01]: Samsung, the light sensors are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't test for every different
version of Android phone, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I couldn't guarantee or say that they
would be accurate for anybody's use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly the Photon one I found to be
consistent and useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you have an iPhone, definitely
download that and have a go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the PPFD app, I'm in contact with
the guys that developed the PPFD app.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually have a Bluetooth
connection to what's called the unit T lux
[SPEAKER_01]: meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're basically using an external
device with your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has some calibration for
different grow light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can hack to get an image of the
equivalent of a $300 quantum sensor power
[SPEAKER_01]: meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the unit T Bluetooth version is
again about $20, $25.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's perfectly possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really any information in this regard
is better than none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mapping out your area, having a look to
see what the light intensity is at
[SPEAKER_01]: different points, and then adjusting your
hanging height to optimize that will work
[SPEAKER_01]: with really any of these devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now there's just so many different ways
to kind of go about measuring PAR that
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome that we're actually at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people have PAR measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing I want to get into is DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't think I covered this on the
beginner video I did with Austin from
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilltech.
[SPEAKER_00]: DLI, daily lighting integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the intensity at a moment in
time, which is your PAR intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's measured in micromoles per
meter squared per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the quantity of photons impacting
on a meter every second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you've got different lengths
of day then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what biologists and horticulturists are
interested in is how much will the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake, not just instantaneously at that
moment in time, but over the total day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it does vary by species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a shade loving plant,
for example, it's going to have a much
[SPEAKER_01]: lower requirement for light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not going to want to be exposed
to high light intensity for a long period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you get plants which will take up
a lot of light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything from fruiting plants,
chilies, peppers, tomatoes, corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way to medicinal herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of those will utilize high levels
of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for reference, by the way,
we were talking earlier on about high
[SPEAKER_01]: light intensity being 1,000 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun would be about 2,000 micromoles
midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're replicating indoors is a
lower maximum intensity than sunlight at
[SPEAKER_01]: midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course, the sun varies throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DLI is a measurement of capturing that
light intensity over a whole day,
[SPEAKER_01]: which outside in the sun, it would start
off at maybe about 400 or 500 micromoles
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning, rise up and peak at about
2,000, and drop down to about 500 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: evening before sunset.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if it's a cloudless sky,
if it's a clear sky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you sum total that up over a 12
hour day, that equates roughly to about 40
[SPEAKER_01]: DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DLI daily light integral, integral
means just adding all of the results
[SPEAKER_01]: together, just combining everything under
that graph and some accumulating it
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the recommended maximum DLI for
tomatoes, for example, is 40 moles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a general guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have a sort of semi-shade plants or
not as hungry plants that would be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with 20 moles per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, you'd have shade ones that
might only want five.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we look at it because you're trying to
understand, as I said, not just the light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity, but also looking at the aspect
of over the light on the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some time that you have, how much light
are the plants receiving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually I do have a cheat sheet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for DLI, low light plants, five to 10,
medium light plants, 10 to 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then high light plants, 15 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are various sources online that
kind of measure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually search DLI calculator,
and there's a number of different sources
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically just enter in the PPFD,
a canopy, and then the number of hours
[SPEAKER_00]: that the light is on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you press the calculate button,
and then it'll calculate the DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some medicinal varieties, I've heard
of going 50, 55, upwards of 65 DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interesting development with LEDs,
so it used to be restricted in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor lighting because HID based,
you would only get so much light into an
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor area before heat would overrun you
and you'd be battling against heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the restrictive measure really to
maximizing the potential from a space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that LEDs are involved in a much more
efficient, people are starting to use much
[SPEAKER_01]: higher light levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 500 micro moles was high performance
five, six years ago with HID.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, it's now risen up to a
thousand, which means you can basically
[SPEAKER_01]: double the yield from the same space and
all of the things being in line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's impressive that improvement as
technology has had a real benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons why you can
jump, you know, when you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation stage, for example,
I think you mentioned like 500 PPFD,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you switch that light cycle
instead of doing 18 hours a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're down to 12 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're increasing the PAR number up to,
you know, 900 is a rough number up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand, as some people say, but you do
the DLI and it actually makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use that DLI calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense because you're dropping the
number of light hours per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're increasing the PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into light spectrum next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start with green light because
there's a lot of misinformation when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to green light, but I do want to
kind of start from the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: electromagnetic spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's UVA, UVB and UVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about UV light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UV, the lower down the spectrum we go,
the higher energy the light photons are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UV, UVC would be the lowest wavelength
of ultraviolet, but it's got high energy
[SPEAKER_01]: photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why they're damaging and can cause
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, you don't get UVC through
from the sun because it's filtered out by
[SPEAKER_01]: the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And similarly, with HID and LEDs,
you don't get UVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to be concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's good because it would damage us
and damage the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And UVB is similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that it's still high energy photons,
but not as damaging, not as cancer causing
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically damaging cells as UVC would
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they do some damage, as we know,
because we get some burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a response you can get from
plants by using UVB in a measured way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can stimulate increases in oil
production by using UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardeners will know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever grown rosemary outdoors and
grown it indoors under glass outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will get a nice sticky resin on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feel it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much richer in terms of its perfume
and its flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's grown under glass, it will
still be green.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get as much physical growth,
but it won't have that stickiness and that
[SPEAKER_01]: resin-ness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the same with medicinal
herbs and lots of other plants where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for oil production for
higher quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few studies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's one of those sort of
frontier parts of indoor growing where
[SPEAKER_01]: people are learning and developing and
understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in essence, you can increase oil
production, which is the terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get better smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't get higher potency with
additional herbs, but you get better
[SPEAKER_01]: quality in terms of flavor and smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's used in short bursts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to use it all the way
through the grow because basically it's
[SPEAKER_01]: signaling the plant to divert its energy
from growing in terms of putting on mass
[SPEAKER_01]: to generating oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, we only recommend
using it in the last two or three weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the plant has put on most of its
weight and its bulk, and we're only using
[SPEAKER_01]: it a couple of hours a day in the middle
of the light cycle to trigger this
[SPEAKER_01]: response in the plant to generate oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that oil has more uses than just to
smell and to taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those oils also protect the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a natural response of the
plant to protect itself against these UVB
[SPEAKER_01]: photons, which could potentially damage
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: We then have UVA, which from a
photosynthetic point of view, and from a
[SPEAKER_01]: development point of view, it's very like
blue in that it has an effect on growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's not as photosynthetically
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UVA photons, if you had 100 UVA
photons, for example, and 100 blue
[SPEAKER_01]: photons, the UVA photons would only be
about 20% as effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the blue photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not particularly useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are included in grow light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're costly to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't last very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I said, they're no different from a
plant development or growth point of view
[SPEAKER_01]: than adding blue photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant responds the same whether
they're blue or UVA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that response is to shorten the
basically smaller cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means smaller cells, which means
shorter, denser plants and shorter,
[SPEAKER_01]: denser leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, I wouldn't recommend to
spend money or resources on UVA in a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: light system.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And UVC goes from 100 to 280 nanometers,
UVB 280 to 315 nanometers, and then UVA
[SPEAKER_00]: 315 to 400 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of good information about UV
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up is a 400 to 500 nanometers,
which blue light falls into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you kind of touched on one of the
effects of blue light, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter inter nodal spacing and inhibits
cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to us about blue light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue light is photosynthetically
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it grows the plants effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 80% efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it stimulates, again, a response in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have less, for example,
less than about 3% or 4% blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: you will get very stretched out plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what growers used to
experience with high pressure sodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is certainly less, usually about 3%,
but certainly less than 4% blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the plant, again, it responds to
the proportion of blue light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will grow shorter, as you said,
inter nodal distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the distance between the branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all aspects of the plant will be
shorter and more compact and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the stalks, all of the leaves
will be slightly shorter and more dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more blue light you have in a
spectrum, up to about 25%, after which
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the balance, if you look
at, again, most white light, so even a
[SPEAKER_01]: 2,000 color temperature, so a very warm
white light, will have the minimum of
[SPEAKER_01]: about 5%, 6% blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: 3,000K up to about 5,000K, the percentage
blue will range from about 12% up to about
[SPEAKER_01]: 23%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any of the white lights that you get,
white LED lights that manifest are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing, most of them will have
sufficient blue in the spectrum to deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: short dense growth, which is what we want
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the plants to be short and compact
because we're height limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want the plants to put on as much
bulk as possible without wasting energy
[SPEAKER_01]: basically growing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, most grow light
listings, they're not going to tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: what the percent blue is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, you only see that from an
integrated sphere report.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your manufacturer is cool and they
are transparent, they will provide you
[SPEAKER_00]: that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can certainly reach out to your
manufacturer, ask them for that report,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it will list the different
percentages of colors that that grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: admits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next up is a 500 to 600 nanometers
green light falls into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think a lot of people know
that green light is actually used by the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant or absorbed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of misinformation that
says that green light isn't used at all by
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got those headlamps with the
green light that's emitted because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not supposed to impact the plant at all,
but that's not actually the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about green light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll debunk first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the early days of LEDs grow lights,
people didn't have efficient white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only had relatively efficient blue
and red LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all they used in grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order to sell them, they took data,
some sort of scientific reports and
[SPEAKER_01]: studies and took them out of context and
used them as a marketing tool to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: we are using blue and red LEDs and they're
more efficient than in other lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, like HPS, because plants only
absorb blue and red light and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: absorb green.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the green light out of HPS is
wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, basically you can you
can use a much smaller wattage LED light
[SPEAKER_01]: than HID.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which was total BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was based on, as I said, taking
scientific studies and reports and
[SPEAKER_01]: criteria and using them totally out of
context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next bit that sort of confuses people is
that plants are generally green and it
[SPEAKER_01]: stands, you know, it's common sense that
something that's green is reflecting green
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does reflect some of the green light,
but it also green light tends to penetrate
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also will bounce around within the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very useful as part of the
overall grow light recipe to have in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, because it'll get down into the
leaf and photosynthesize parts of the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: that other blue and red, for example,
won't photosynthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also down into lower parts of the
plant, which won't photosynthesize,
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't photosynthesize otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next part to it is the green lamp that
people use for inspecting their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green light tends to be the per for the
amount of photons output is the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: response visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you took, again, 100 photons of
blue, 100 photons of green, 100 photons of
[SPEAKER_01]: red, we would see much better under those
100 photons of green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives us our eyes are much more
responsive to to green light than other
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are going to use a light in an
environment, it is better to use a green
[SPEAKER_01]: light because you can use less of it than
a white light or a red light or a blue
[SPEAKER_01]: light just to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, it's sort of putting two and
two together and getting four to say that
[SPEAKER_01]: using a green green light doesn't affect
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will if you use enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're able to use a very small amount
of it to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore, it's the best one to use if
you have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, the experiments that were done
and some McCree McCree curve that people
[SPEAKER_01]: have seen, it's experiments that were done
in the 70s, which looked at the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth rate under discrete wavelengths of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they took maybe a five nanometer
bandwidth of blue light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shone it at a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually algae in a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at the amount of oxygen it
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much photosynthesis was occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked at that discreetly all the
way up through the spectrum to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: responsive plants were to different
discrete wavelengths of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what happens in reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: In reality, we don't mush a plant to put
it into a dish and shine beams of of of
[SPEAKER_01]: narrow wavelength beams of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is in an environment where
there's all different wavelengths of
[SPEAKER_01]: light, all interacting with the plant in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those studies, it's shown that
green light is just as effective as blue
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there still is a higher level of
photosynthetic efficiency with red
[SPEAKER_01]: photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so green green is the last thing about
green is that if you have only blue and
[SPEAKER_01]: red, you get a purple light and purple
light doesn't reflect any light off the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and the leaves look black and you
can't see your plants properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having green light in with blue and red
means you get white and white light means
[SPEAKER_01]: you can see your plants more clearly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a proverb which is escaping me
now about gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it basically says, you know,
if you can't see what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having a clear white light where
you can see, you know, where there might
[SPEAKER_01]: be nutrient deficiencies, you can see
where there might be some burning
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, disease, any of those things
kind of things you can see much more
[SPEAKER_01]: clearly under white light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for all those reasons, green light is a
very useful part of the grow lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of misinformation about green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad that more and more information
and more and more people are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how green light is useful to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about red light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's next 600 to 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 660 nanometers is kind of a
highlight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people talk about 660 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can get into far red as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: 700 to 750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: 730 nanometers is talked about pretty
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked to us about red light and far
red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So red light is useful in two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at the opposite end of spectrum of UV
and therefore it's higher wavelength and
[SPEAKER_01]: lower energy photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So electrically they're cheaper to produce
because they're individually they're lower
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So per watt you can produce more red
photons than you can blue or UV photons,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're electrically efficient to
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the plant is most responsive to
red photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compared to blue and green,
red photons are more photosynthetically
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient by about 10 or 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having as much red as possible in that
mix will deliver the highest electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: and also photosynthetic efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have an effect on the plant
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a thinner color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like your carbs in your dinner or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not adding flavor or anything,
but it's adding bulk and it's adding
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to affect the way the plant
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the common misconception again that if
a light doesn't have the little red diodes
[SPEAKER_01]: in it, that it's not suitable for
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make the plant flower or
enhance the flowering or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it does is basically boost the
electrical and the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency of the spectrum overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those little red diodes are generally
much more expensive than white diodes with
[SPEAKER_01]: their higher micromole per watt efficiency
in terms of output.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put them in there as I often
describe like a turbo booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got your main engine, which is the
blue and the green and the bulk of the red
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from the white LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's providing most of the light and the
spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have these red diodes,
which can boost the electrical and
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic efficiency of the system
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good information for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last but not least, IR, infrared light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to know about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're going to start with fire red
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So infrared is effectively heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not photosynthetic, so it doesn't
cause plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And infrared is what we'd look at with an
infrared camera where we'd see basically
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation coming off the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get night vision and all that
sort of stuff you can see in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Infrared is beyond 750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire red is just beyond red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a very deep red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire red LEDs at 730 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see them glowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very deep red.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't look bright, but you can
definitely see that there's light coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're still in the visible spectrum
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as photosynthetically
efficient as red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, adding fire red diodes,
if you wanted to get more growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would just simply add more white or
red diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there is a belief that adding
fire red will somehow boost the other
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum that you have in the power
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, there's a bit of a misuse
around the Emerson effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Emerson effect is really a
complementary effect that using different
[SPEAKER_01]: grow light spectrum will have on the
overall rate of photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of growth that you'll get from
that lighting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a very small benefit to adding a
small bit of fire red in with red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll complement the red and free up a
little bit more of the red photons to be
[SPEAKER_01]: active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll boost the efficiency of the red.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's literally, I can't remember the
exact figure, but somewhere around 5% or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's only if you use a small amount of
fire red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire red is not like red or green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like blue in that it has this effect
on plant development as well as growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has the opposite effect to blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fire red, too much of it will cause
plant stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll cause cell expansion and plants to
stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a bit like blue, where you want
a minimum of 5% to keep plants dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: At fire red, you don't really want more
than 5% or your plant will start to be
[SPEAKER_01]: stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can balance it off with blue,
but then you're into sort of a war with
[SPEAKER_01]: the blue and the fire red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most LEDs, if you look at their grow light
spectrum charts, there'll be a little tail
[SPEAKER_01]: or a little at the end of the curve will
go beyond the 700 nanometers, beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: red into fire red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most white LEDs will emit about 2% or 3%
fire red anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, again, and in my view,
there's a misconception that adding fire
[SPEAKER_01]: red LEDs is going to give this
extraordinary boost to the effectiveness
[SPEAKER_01]: of the rest of the photons, of the other,
the red, the green, and the blue photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's only a very marginal effect and
one that you would get from almost every
[SPEAKER_01]: grow light anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: And adding additional fire red LEDs is,
in my view, counterproductive in that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're now having to add more blue in
order to balance that off so your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: don't stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want more growth, more power,
just more power, keep it in the narrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: straight narrow between the 400 and the
700.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular in the red area,
because as I said, that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: electrically and photosynthetically
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I also heard no more than 5% for the
fire red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other effect, particularly on
medicinal varieties, is foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had grow lights before that had
more than that 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And towards the end of flowering,
it's just foxtailing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it impacts bud development in that
avenue as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, again, there's a lot of marketing
around grow light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way I often describe it is,
you know, when you buy a stereo,
[SPEAKER_01]: for us of a certain vintage, we'll
remember in the 90s, there was this craze
[SPEAKER_01]: with all these graphic equalizers and
lights and buttons and sliders and all
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of thing, none of which made the
sound any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, if anything, they were taking
money away from putting in good quality
[SPEAKER_01]: components into having flashing lights and
dials and indicators that didn't add to
[SPEAKER_01]: the sound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bit like that with grow lights,
as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: People see the blues and the UVs and the
fire reds and these extra diodes and think
[SPEAKER_01]: they add something.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I see is waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see money being put into stuff,
which is just marketing trinkets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want more growth, get more
power, which is just per watt getting
[SPEAKER_01]: higher efficiency grow lights or having
more wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most modern, I haven't seen a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tested a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tested maybe 100 grow lights in
the last two years, two or three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen one whose spectrum wasn't
suitable for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of search for sort of
little gains here or there with spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: or sort of magic secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally, there isn't any.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, use a white light, use enough
of it, distribute the light evenly,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll optimize your potential yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember going to MJ BizCon a couple of
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know, it's an expo
and every company is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically every company is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show off their newest products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this lighting company, I stopped by
their booth and I forget the name of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light, but they had it so you could
adjust the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like super customizable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like a $4,000 grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked by there and just raised my
eyebrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like $4,000?
[SPEAKER_00]: It made no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, marketing is involved
in that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would say is if you're growing a
very specific plant, it could be a bedding
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, or it could be a herb, and you're a
mass producer, and you're generating
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands, you know, you have acres of
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you might do is you might refine a
spectrum to, for example, so tweaks in the
[SPEAKER_01]: red and tweaks in the far red can affect,
for example, the time that your petunias
[SPEAKER_01]: flower at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can trigger particular responses
in plants in order to make them flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to make them more leafy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I said about far red, but again,
there's a misconception out there because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some videos out there of people
showing that far red can produce a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, but it's of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lettuce, you're looking just to get
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want lots and lots of leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want it to produce as much leaf as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far red in that instance is basically
making them stretch a little bit and
[SPEAKER_01]: generating more leaf, which is what you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, you could be using a little bit
higher blue will bring out, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to pronounce it properly,
anthracyanins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, the sort of purple pigments in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're producing a red lettuce,
for example, or a purple lettuce indoors
[SPEAKER_01]: under green, under artificial lighting,
you might want to tweak the light spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring out certain characteristics of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, if you're a home grower in
particular, it's a bit like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: your setting will never be perfect for the
different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want is something that hits the
middle for the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that sense, having, as I said,
anywhere between five and 15 percent blue,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 30 percent green, about 40 percent
red is your optimum spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefits of moving away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So putting money into having dials to
adjust spectrum and different drivers and
[SPEAKER_01]: different channels and all that sort of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my view, you'd be far better off just
having more light and a more efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to get more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're certain to get more yield that way
rather than being uncertainly twiddling
[SPEAKER_01]: around with things, trying to get an
effect which will be different based on
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains and varieties of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whether it's indica dominant
or sativa dominant, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal herbs, you could have a
different response from different plants
[SPEAKER_01]: under the under different lighting
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just stay in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't make something more complicated than
it should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get as much light down there as your
plants can can absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it down evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you want to tweak and
twiddle, start looking at medium or
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or something else, because if
you've optimized your lighting,
[SPEAKER_01]: your lighting spectrum with a modern grow
light, which is white, there really is not
[SPEAKER_01]: much other places to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you mentioned just a few minutes
ago, you've tested over 100 grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to know what are some of the best
grow lights on the market today that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've tested?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I put it into different categories,
really, because there are some lights
[SPEAKER_01]: which are just really, really good value
and extraordinary quality for how cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are others which are multiple of
times as expensive per watt to buy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but are extraordinary because they have
really good efficiency and really high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality in terms of their build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say in the budget category,
I reviewed some that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: exceptionally good from a build quantity,
build quality point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your Amazon type lights around a dollar
a watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, they tend to be a little bit
teeny and flimsy at parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one that stood out for me was Maxisun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really high quality build.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that sort of build quality where you
just when you have it in your hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nothing in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the little details.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything is finished off really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have that sort of baking tin type
reflector that Mars Hydro used and a few
[SPEAKER_01]: other manufacturers use, but it's a little
bit more solid and it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: robust than maybe the Mars Hydro one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking of Mars Hydro there,
what's the name of it again?
[SPEAKER_01]: The long form one.
[SPEAKER_00]: SP 3000.
[SPEAKER_01]: SP series.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been out about two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've revised it this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, in the lower price category,
that's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the medium price range, I'm going to
plug my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Migro Array, I try to strike that
balance between being good quality as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as good performance and decent price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a good balance of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get up into the higher performance
range or higher price range, more
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial type fixtures in terms of the
cost in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say Lumetech, also known as
Photon Tech in the US are an excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using them for 15 years as my
first digital product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ballast I bought was Lumetech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never heard anything of them good
things about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their build quality is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The performance is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bit of a premium for it, but it's
worthwhile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gavita.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love their LED light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's, you know, probably would
be in the commercial space if you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be paying that much for them because
they're quite expensive in terms of cost
[SPEAKER_01]: per dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I've reviewed hundreds of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't review all the grow lights I get
offered or asked to review.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone that I do has sort of passed the
basic test that I've taken out of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't fallen apart in my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: The build quality is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The performance is decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kind of particular about the
information they provide as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check to see, are they making
reasonable, are their specifications
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I would reject I'd probably
reject like two to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd probably reject two grow lights for
every one I test on the basis that there's
[SPEAKER_01]: an awful lot of spurious sort of,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just missing on a few of the main
points in terms of build quality and in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, the marketing information or
the specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had one the other day and I
looked OK on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Chinese manufacturer,
which, by the way, is not a derogatory
[SPEAKER_01]: term I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it sometimes and people think that
I'm using that as a derogatory term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, why drivers are made
in Hong Kong.
[SPEAKER_01]: My LED boards are assembled in China and
shipped here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, pretty much every grow light is
made in China these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a not separating out Chinese
as a derogatory term.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, they were marketed and sold
directly by the themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took it out of the box and immediately
the central beam, which had the drivers in
[SPEAKER_01]: it, was just rattling around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I opened up the cover and it was
you could just the build quality that the
[SPEAKER_01]: extrusions were really thin and really
tinny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the drivers weren't fixed down
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I opened it up, it was just like
a rat's nest of wiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, anyway, I call them
oblivion just said, look, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it in the bin or you can collect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not testing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is still quite a lot of junk out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend if you're going to
buy a grow light, do have a look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: channel because it's a it's at least a
minimum level of guarantee that the build
[SPEAKER_01]: quality is up to a comparable standard or
a good standard for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, as I said, you'll see from the
performance whether the components are of
[SPEAKER_01]: a good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not high performance means they've
had to use good quality components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medium, you know, is probably price
related.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably trading off with cost and
price and low efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I may not be, you know,
I may not saying it directly to camera,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can usually tell if you watch me
closely that I'm sort of this could be
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be subtly hinting that there's better
things on the market than this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it might be adequate in other
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're very transparent when it
comes and very honest when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow light reviews and you don't
review any bad grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just for clarification, you used to
years ago and used to be very brutally
[SPEAKER_00]: honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at one of your titles right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally pointless grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were some sort of novelty grow
lights that because people would send me
[SPEAKER_01]: emails saying, you know, for example,
I bought some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've seen them on
Amazon, the home garden lights and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have a stand and they have these flexible
arms with these little LED bars on the
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're supposed to position them over
your house plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, people have offered me them
and I've actually gathered together about
[SPEAKER_01]: five or six of them to do like,
you know, when I have a couple of days
[SPEAKER_01]: where I just want to have a bit of fun to
reduce, I'm going to test those and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do because I'm pretty sure
they're going to be attractive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be ferocious.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't want I like to keep
things not non-contentious, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: basically don't want to be rubbishing
anybody else's products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to be having a negative
effect on another company unnecessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just don't like that five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like, you know, the sort of
comments that come with it and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be gracious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope when a really good light that's
much better than mine is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'll just be quiet and hold
my peace when when there's some junk or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'll give a subtle indication
that I'm, you know, not very impressed
[SPEAKER_01]: with the projector fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting technology has come so far in
such a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned Mars Hydro having a
good light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say that, you know, back in 2015,
2016, people will laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had hot garbage lights back then,
but they've really turned things around
[SPEAKER_00]: and their lights have gotten a lot better
and they're up there with the best
[SPEAKER_00]: nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my question is, with lighting
technology moving so rapidly, what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: see?
[SPEAKER_00]: What innovations do you see happening with
lighting technology in the upcoming five
[SPEAKER_00]: years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting cheaper is the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the same with, you know,
domestic lighting, all forms of lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of failure and problems with
LED lights, the biggest issue up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years was actually the power
supplies for the LED drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the thing most likely to fail
out of a lighting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of that was just cheap,
cheaply made, low efficiency drivers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would generate a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's components called capacitors
in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a little bit like a battery,
but they've got a gel in them and they
[SPEAKER_01]: literally dry out and pop when heated too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only get the flickering of an LED
light, like a home light or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: starts to flicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see it in vehicle lights as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's often because the driver has blown,
not necessarily the LEDs are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the LEDs themselves, the
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look beneath that phosphorous,
the yellow coating on top of the LEDs down
[SPEAKER_01]: into what's underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the basic technology has not changed
in the last 10 years in terms of white
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're basically a blue LED underneath
that white phosphorous coating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that white phosphorous diffracts or
breaks up that blue light into other
[SPEAKER_01]: colors, so into green or red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more phosphorous you use,
the more warm the color will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more red it will produce and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that technology hasn't changed very
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has happened is we've got,
it's got cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are using more LEDs compared to
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're using more of them per
watt, because they're using more of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're running them at lower currents or
lower wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, at lower wattage,
they run more efficiently, but they also
[SPEAKER_01]: run cooler and they're less likely to burn
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within the LEDs, there's tiny little gold
wires attached onto the wafers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they overheat, those gold wires
melt or detach from the wafers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when LEDs blow, basically,
or burn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between the driver technology getting
better, up to about 95% is pretty standard
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to improve very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The basic LED technology, there isn't a
new technology out in the last 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all just refining and tweaking
and twiddling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And improving the overall system
efficiency by using more LEDs with better
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance or more accuracy in terms of the
circuitry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's delivering slightly higher
efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is being obtained today could
have been obtained seven or eight years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago with a very high amount of cost,
or at least close to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest difference now is cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where it wouldn't have been uncommon
for a 100 watt to say a little light for a
[SPEAKER_01]: two by two would have been $300 for a high
efficiency one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying high efficiency 2 to 2.2
micro moles per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: These four or five years ago, you could
now get for $100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's dropped by a third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a big reduction just in the
last 12 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's typical of a maturing industry,
really, that when people stop innovating
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting new developments in
technology, they then all fight each other
[SPEAKER_01]: with the same technology for the same
market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes all the way up and down the
supply chain and everybody tightens their
[SPEAKER_01]: belts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually you'll end up with a smaller
number of large manufacturers who are very
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient, have their costs controlled
very well and delivering high volumes and
[SPEAKER_01]: therefore are able to deliver low prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a lot of new entrants,
big entrants into the market in the last
[SPEAKER_01]: year or so coming in very aggressively
with low pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's what's going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the next thing is, as I was saying
before, about pushing the limit of light
[SPEAKER_01]: levels and light intensity and yields per
square meter or per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the developments which
might assist that is cheaper and more
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible environment control in terms of
CO2 supplementation and that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've already got these sensors,
you can get a CO2 sensor now for $40 or
[SPEAKER_01]: $50, where I bought one four years ago and
I bought the cheapest one I could find and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's $350.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sensing technology getting better,
like we were talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: having better control over your lighting
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting equipment and technology that
will help you set up better and optimize
[SPEAKER_01]: your setup better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's where I think things are
going over the next, certainly the next
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely that's exciting for
consumers to have cheaper prices,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more affordable for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the YouTube channel is MIGRO.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Instagram, it's MIGROLIGHT,
so Instagram, MIGROLIGHT website is www
[SPEAKER_01]: .migrolight.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we do interviews with industry
professionals and experts, do the reviews,
[SPEAKER_01]: do tips and tricks and how tos and hacks
and all that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything grow lighting really related
to any of the topics we discussed this
[SPEAKER_01]: evening, for example, I'll have either a
video or a couple of posts on it on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a blog on the website related and
really just refining that and improving
[SPEAKER_01]: that over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots more grow light reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just finishing and filming a series on
grow light, sort of up to date videos on
[SPEAKER_01]: grow light spectrum, how to size your grow
light, how high to hang your grow light,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those basic things that people want to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just about to release a whole sort of
new version of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know yourself from sort of being a
producer that I look back on the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: I did three years ago and I cringe now and
I think I really got to get them up to at
[SPEAKER_01]: least my current standard because yeah,
they're hard even for me to get through
[SPEAKER_01]: because I wasn't as capable as I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will link Shane's YouTube channel
down in the description section below on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also link a website, MigroLED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link that website down in the
