[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you're doing bottled nutrients
and you would have your part A and your
[SPEAKER_01]: part B and your part A is for veg and your
part B is for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our part A is fermented plant juice and
our part B is fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is oriental herbal nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for plants, animals,
and humans too.
[SPEAKER_01]: OHN helps get rid of pathogens,
diseases, ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could help boost your immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juice is a rich enzyme
solution made out of beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemicals inside of the plant and you
let it soak and ferment for so many days
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you strain out the shells and
then what you have left over is water
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is filled with life and as a
regenerative farmer all you're doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 57.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Green's
goddess.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been gardening for eight years and
grows a variety of plants such as
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, house plants, herbs,
and medicinal varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode she talks about a handful
of KNF methods which stands for Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also talks about composting,
bokashi, and reveals a high fungal tea
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Julie, AKA Green's
Goddess.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing amazing, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a live stream that we did not too
long ago and I was on Twitch and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of people loved the information that
you gave.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of people in the chat that
were really thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd have you on here,
Garden Talk, and let's get deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk about a handful
of KNF methods and then we're also going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into composting, which may help
many of you work towards a closed loop
[SPEAKER_00]: operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into those things,
let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Julie, AKA Green's Goddess.
[SPEAKER_01]: At home, I like gardening and growing a
lot of different plants, herbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables, fruits, whatever, name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like growing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been having a lot of fun doing it and
it's just very therapeutic, I've found.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I love doing is digging into
natural farming because I want to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow plants organically and I think
just microbials and stuff like that are
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our lives, I'm glad that your listeners
on our last chat wanted to have me back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for letting me be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I do is I run Luna Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: My website is lunagardens.co and I just
help educate people about plant medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it helps people heal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really involved in the plant world and
how natural plants can be used to help
[SPEAKER_01]: people heal from a variety of ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyday modern sickness, even just
boosting your immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we all ate more organic plants and
spent more time out in nature and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sunshine and fresh air, it could help all
of us heal a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm totally into stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally into the natural way of doing
things, which is cool because it's a more
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable way to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cheaper way to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many benefits to going that
route.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about KNF in particular,
I don't want to assume my audience knows
[SPEAKER_00]: what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about what is KNF and what
inputs do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF stands for Korean Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I have ever learned about
KNF, I learned it online by watching Chris
[SPEAKER_01]: Trump's YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even check out his website,
christrump.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a lot of really great information
on there about what type of inputs you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to use at what certain times and how
you can make your own inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I've done to help
save money by making your own inputs to
[SPEAKER_01]: put back into your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things that I have out here
that I have made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: OHN.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Oriental Herbal Nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for plants, animals,
and humans too.
[SPEAKER_01]: OHN helps to get rid of pathogens,
diseases, ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could help boost your immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take a little bit of this every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't open the jar right now because
it's made with sugar in the fermentation
[SPEAKER_01]: process and I got some on the lid and it's
stuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans can take just a little bit every
day to help boost their immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put about four mils of this into a
gallon of water and water your plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: it just once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe once every couple of weeks or maybe
once a month to help boost their immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, for your cats, for example,
or your plants, or if you have livestock,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could give just a little bit of this
into the water and it'll help boost their
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about making that right
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've seen the video, he uses big jugs
and I've done the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend anyone doing this at
home to try to go with smaller jugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take ingredients like angelic root,
cinnamon, ginger, garlic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used turmeric too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody uses turmeric in their OHN
recipe, but I've used it in mine because
[SPEAKER_01]: he had recommended it on his YouTube page.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made it at the time, so I added it into
mine because I did exactly as he did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turmeric's really great for your heart and
your blood anyway, so why not add it in
[SPEAKER_01]: with the rest of your OHN?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that's been used for
centuries just as a tonic to help people
[SPEAKER_01]: feel better, but it can also be given to
plants and animals to help boost their
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system, help them feel better as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the ingredients are dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You rehydrate them by letting them soak in
beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can taste the different beers and
people's different OHNs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used IPA beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Matt, Mile High Gardener,
he had used stout, which actually tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: much better than mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're done hydrating those
ingredients, you move on to the next step,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is to put all the ingredients into a
big jar of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot how long it took me, but it was
over a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember I wrote all the dates down,
but I went in there every single day and
[SPEAKER_01]: stirred those jars every day to mix the
ingredients around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you strain it through a strainer,
then you put the ingredients back in,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you fill the jar back up a third
of the way, and then you add more alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: to the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you let that sit for another two
weeks or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want more details, you've got to
check out his YouTube page because it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: have all the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then do you dilute it down before giving
your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you give to the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: In this way, it's straight alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would give it just four milliliters
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to give it to your plants
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you gave it to them once a week,
once every other week would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foliar spraying is great too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on, I'll talk about the maintenance
solution because this is something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would mix three different ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: OHN would be your first ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your second ingredient is fermented plant
juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juice is usually made out
of fresh shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the word I'm thinking of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juice is a rich enzyme
solution made out of beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemicals inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say in your backyard, you've got weeds and
you've got a lot of things growing fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go out there early in the morning and
you harvest all of the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put the tips into a big bucket and you
mix it with equal weights of raw brown
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it together, then you take it in a
jar about this size and you smash it all
[SPEAKER_01]: down so that it's all compressed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you put a breathable lid on top and
you leave it in a cool, dark area for
[SPEAKER_01]: about two weeks, depending on the plant
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants break down a lot faster than
other plants, but basically through that
[SPEAKER_01]: osmotic pressure and fermentation,
the sugar starts eating away at the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and it starts releasing all of this great
chemical compound in a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you strain off and you collect the
liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use that liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing as pH in about four mils per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fermented plant juice is made out of
fresh leaves, fresh tips, greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using that as an input for your veg
side of things to help your plants grow
[SPEAKER_01]: fast in their veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another thing called fermented
fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented fruit juice, this is made out of
fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the fruits, you're getting out all of
the nutrients and chemical compounds in
[SPEAKER_01]: those fruits that are letting your plants
know it's time to make more fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut up your fruits, you mix it in with
equal weights of raw brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You push it in a jar with a breathable lid
and you give it a couple of weeks for the
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation process to do its thing and
then you strain it out and you keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The liquid for fermented fruit juice is
about eight mils when you're in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juice, OHN, and brown rice
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could make it if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just buy this off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has so many great qualities,
just this alone, how helpful it is for
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like a cleanser.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown rice vinegar plus OHN plus fermented
plant juice is all added together to make
[SPEAKER_01]: a maintenance solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could order these products,
by the way, off of somebody that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: who's making them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of people making KNF
products and selling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't want to make it yourself but
you want to give it a try, you could
[SPEAKER_01]: totally buy it off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my KNF maintenance solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's those three ingredients, OHN,
fermented plant juice, and brown rice
[SPEAKER_01]: vinegar mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to give my plants a boost,
I'd give them just a little bit of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 mils per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil drench or foliar spray is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you do the maintenance
solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that you need to do it if
you're foliar spraying and also doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil drench, then maybe one or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it just once a week,
it's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go in a flower, you don't want to
foliar spray anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to put it in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a week is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once every other week is fine too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I've made water soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we move on to that, I did have a
question about the fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to kind of quick recap, four
mililiters per gallon for the fermented
[SPEAKER_00]: plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is going to mostly be veg during the
vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the fruit fermented juice would be
used during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's eight mililiters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use them individually or you can
make that maintenance solution that you
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do either or.
[SPEAKER_01]: The maintenance solution that I've made is
only with the fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does kind of get a bit confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could totally use just fermented fruit
juice with water and just water that to
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The OHN is kind of used sparingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to add it all the time,
but it's definitely beneficial to have it
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you're doing bottled nutrients
and you would have your part A and your
[SPEAKER_01]: part B and your part A is for veg and then
your part B is for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our part A is fermented plant juice and
our part B is fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use all sorts of types of
different fruits to make the fermented
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard you should probably stay away from
citric fruits and pineapple, but my friend
[SPEAKER_01]: that does fermented plant extracts makes
this fermented pumpkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't want to make it yourself,
you could buy it off of somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then same thing, this one's like the
comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one you would use in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one I would use in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get things from builder soil,
don't you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's something I've been wanting to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think maybe this year I'll definitely
experiment with fermented juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that other thing that you were
going to show behind you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I cut you off before I cut you off?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water-soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is made with your eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You collect all of your eggshells,
preferably organic, and see if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing your own regenerative farming and
you had chickens, you would just use your
[SPEAKER_01]: own eggshells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you do is you collect eggshells
and you crush them up and then you cook
[SPEAKER_01]: them, preferably outdoors on a pan until
they get nice and brown, and then you put
[SPEAKER_01]: them into one of these containers of brown
rice vinegar and you let it soak and
[SPEAKER_01]: ferment for so many days and then you
strain out the shells and then what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have left over is water-soluble calcium,
available to be taken up to the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: love it, they'll take it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the eggshells should be laid
out and that you should potentially cook
[SPEAKER_00]: it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't recommend that they do it
inside and like their oven, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like on your stove top, you could if
you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a lot of people, it creates a nasty
odor, so they just prefer to do it outside
[SPEAKER_01]: is all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did mine outside, so I just grabbed one
of those cast iron pans and went outside
[SPEAKER_01]: and mixed it all around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep mixing it so it's nice and
brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't clean out your eggshells,
they do kind of have this white fluffy
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that needs to be cooked off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that stuff in your
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the eggshell itself, not any part of
the embryo or yolk or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, is there a specific
ratio of eggshells to vinegar?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, one tenth eggshells and the other
nine tenths to brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one you would apply a little bit
when you first transition your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: about four mils per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Later on in flower, when they start
producing, then you would put eight mils
[SPEAKER_01]: per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's quite a few people who want
to ditch the bottle of Cal Mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is the way to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're getting calcium through the
eggshells through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you shared that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other easier ways to add in
magnesium, like Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the funny thing is everyone's always
saying more Cal Mag when something goes
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong and it could possibly be a lockout
of another nutrient, not that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: missing that nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that you added too much of one thing
and you got a lockout of something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the running joke is just add more
Cal Mag and then it's like, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it military Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there medical grade Cal Mag?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the one, what was that one skit
that people would say like, I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: disease and the only cure is more Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many memes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other stuff, water soluble calcium,
and I already showed you my bloom ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sea salt is one of the ingredients,
one of the KNF minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a little bit throughout the whole
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote down here one to two grams of sea
salt per liter of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you measure it out in your hand,
then you know how much goes in and I put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in my water and I let it swirl around
and I put that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fish amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this off of a friend from
Neverwinter Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is his FAA.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a buddy that is a fisherman,
so he goes to his friend all the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get fish off of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a big fan of fish myself,
so I don't want to go out there and go
[SPEAKER_01]: fishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you love fishing, but let's say you
come home and you're eating up some parts
[SPEAKER_01]: and you've got a whole bunch of heads and
tails left over, whatever you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take all your fish, same thing that
you do with the rest of the inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: equal weights of brown sugar, put it in a
bucket, shove it down, let it ferment for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish amino acid takes a long, long,
long time to ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this could be used all throughout the
growth of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit more during the beginning of
your plants because they need a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more of that nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has a lot of nitrogen rich nutrients
and enzymes and stuff like that in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like for example, if I couldn't make
it myself, you could always buy it off of
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is conscience natural inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I started making my own KNF inputs,
I was getting his just to test the waters
[SPEAKER_01]: and to see if I liked it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, some things are easy
to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The salt's easy to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brown rice vinegar is easy to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to buy it and just give it a try
if you wanted to grow organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the KNF inputs that I have
been messing around with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's because I just love
making things so much, but I just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good time making all these inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermented plant juice is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me so many tries before I got it
right doing fermented plant juice with
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that depends on which leaves you're
buying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them break down really easily and
some of them don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a learning process you learn
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes just got to jump in and get your
hands wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also wanted to get into that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you spoke about it a little bit on
the live stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's value added to speak about it
here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about leaf mold and how
you get that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf mold is what happens when you're out
under a tree or in the forest or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all the branches and all the leaves
and everything that may have grown and
[SPEAKER_01]: then died and then grown and then died,
they all start to collect and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: what is making up your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing why mulch is one
of my favorite things to have around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great when it can help keep your soil
moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even better is the breaking down of
the mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because the leaf is dead doesn't mean
that it lost the nutrients that were
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still stored in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it breaks down in mulch, as it becomes
a leaf mold is when things like fungi and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and other microorganisms start
coming in and decomposing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And breaking it all down for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when they come in to decompose and
break down, those are the guys that are
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding your plants roots, the nutrients
that came out of that mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one reason why we always say to chop
and drop it, if you're if you're cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: it off, just leave it on the ground or on
your bed, whatever setup you got and just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of let nature do the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you've got a healthy dose of
microbials, fungi, bacteria, nematodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: protozoa, worms, just things breaking down
that matter for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do all the work so that you don't
have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So leaf mold, there's a few things you
could do to go out to the forest to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect it and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, to Dom's way of grabbing
microorganisms and bringing them back into
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden is to go out and dig
preferably under like something where
[SPEAKER_01]: you've seen a tree that has fallen down
and a lot of dead material has already
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposed and new life has already grown
on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dig underneath that, that's where
you could find all the fungi and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you know that you got a
good network of leaf mold soil down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's hardly recognizable anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sort of looks like soil, but
technically it's not soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is soil made up of?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's made up of mulch that's
been decomposed time after time after time
[SPEAKER_01]: after time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you grab a handful of that and you
could bring it back home and you could
[SPEAKER_01]: make a microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of the same thing as a compost
tea where that you're giving it some carbs
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed it like a big potato, a little bit
of that sea salt in the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you let it sit in the middle of the
bucket for a few days, depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be a ring around the edge
when the microbes are ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I think that that might be an
outcome of yeast or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some type of action is happening in there
that causes that ring of bubbles to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you have that ring, it's a
perfect opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to use it immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take that big bucket of five gallons,
you mix it in with maybe another 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 gallons of water, and you apply that to
all of your plants to introduce all those
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial into your plants, into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to do it, like the Korean
Natural Farming Way, they call it IMO,
[SPEAKER_01]: which stands for Indigenous
Microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their way of doing it is by having some
slightly cooked rice in a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go out to the forest and then
you dig till you find that area where you
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of mycelium, the leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hardly recognize the material that's
in there anymore, but you can tell that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a lot of great fungal life down
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put your collection box on top of that
and then you kind of not bury it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but cover it up so it's safe from like
bugs and critters or maybe other people
[SPEAKER_01]: walking by wondering what a box is doing
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave that for a few days and that also
depends on the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to be able to take
collections any time of year, including
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me personally, I'm having a really
hard time doing a winter collection right
[SPEAKER_01]: now because all the places I have tried
haven't turned out to be so successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can't give up just because it
doesn't work out the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to keep trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a good successful
collection, a lot of fungi is growing on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of your rice, like a nice white puffy
cloud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some colors are okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, a little bit of mix is okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much of any one color is not okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you take that collection,
you bring it back home with your moldy
[SPEAKER_01]: rice and you mix it equal weights with
brown, like brown sugar, raw brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you let that sit in a jar to ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That becomes shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you wanted to do several
collections, you have all your little
[SPEAKER_01]: jars, your shelf stable jars, once they've
been mixed with the brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's several processes like IMO1
and IMO2 and IMO3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all the different steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next step when you have your
collection is to mix it in water with some
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten this far yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it in water with some other stuff
like a little bit of labs and I believe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of the OHN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think sugar, I'm not sure if you're
adding more sugar to that concoction or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're brewing it around kind of like a
tea and then you're using it to water like
[SPEAKER_01]: malted barley and wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that creates like this pile that
could get really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta keep turning it every once in
a while to make sure it doesn't get too
[SPEAKER_01]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to increase its temperature
but not get above a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually what happens after you've
turned it enough times and it cooked and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's cooling down and now it's completely
finished, you could use that finished
[SPEAKER_01]: product to sprinkle around your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could use it as a tea and it's a
liquid IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is a really amazing way to
introduce microorganisms into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gotta let your microorganisms do
all the work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to continuously add all
these ingredients when your soil's hooked
[SPEAKER_01]: up and it's got plenty of microorganisms,
fungi, bacteria, nematodes, worms,
[SPEAKER_01]: anthropods, microanthropods, protozoa,
all sorts of cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is filled with life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a regenerative farmer, all you're
doing is maintaining that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blows my mind how many practices there
are out there that you can do in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow these plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of these viewers that are
listeners that are tuning into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: their minds are blown because they're so
used to just growing with bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just growing organically using just a
blend that they top dress in or initially
[SPEAKER_00]: amend in the medium, then top dress
throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But using these other methods,
you can get away with not doing any of
[SPEAKER_00]: those top dressings of blends,
not using them at all or using bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF is another way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have great success with KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn more about KNF,
you've got to talk to Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already reached out to him and told him
about the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, can I have Mr. Growett reach
out to you so that you could come on and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to his learners?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for the hook up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard his name so much and he is
somebody who I would love to have on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast because his knowledge is just
extensive when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thanks for hooking it up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows way more about KNF than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the pleasure of having him over and
showed him my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said to me, you're doing too much
and you need to back off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, it didn't comprehend to me
until after some time that I have learned
[SPEAKER_01]: that the thing about bottle nutrients is
you feel like you have to constantly be
[SPEAKER_01]: adding something, but when you're growing
organically, you don't have to constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: be adding stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just maintaining.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what makes it real easy for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that's a topic that you wanted
to get into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a little bit of composting myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do firmer composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have just a small, I think it's like
20 something gallon bin in my garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's winter time right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's cold and everything's
moving pretty slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, I've got something going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure once the springtime and
summertime comes along and the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: heats up a little bit, there's going to be
a lot more activity in my bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that it's often said
that every home grower should be doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different ways to
compost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So firmer composting, what I just
explained is just one way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have a regular compost pile even
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk to us about composting,
what you do, what you know about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing some composting myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't reached the point where I've had
my own finished compost product yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do a composting where you're
at, absolutely go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody has that opportunity because
let's say you live in an apartment or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you needed to buy compost online,
you absolutely could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with vermic compost and worm
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just highly recommend that if you are
going to be purchasing it from somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: else, right now during the wintertime is
the perfect time to go ahead and place
[SPEAKER_01]: that order because the temperatures are so
cold this time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you try doing it during the summertime,
you don't know how long that bag has been
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting out in the sun for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all those great microorganisms that
maybe were once thriving in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of them are dead by the time
it even gets to your place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just something to consider when
composting, if you're buying it off of
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else, purchase it during the
wintertime, bring it back to your area,
[SPEAKER_01]: store it in a nice, dark, cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like having my compost in a bin with a
lid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I've noticed just leaving
my bag out in my garden is it definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: attracts a lot of gnats and flies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I roll it up tightly,
put a clip on it, and then I put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bin that's locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is a time, it's usually during
the summertime, that more little fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: flies or gnats start coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I notice them on my compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put up one of those yellow sticky
traps and just lay it directly on my
[SPEAKER_01]: compost bag and then put the lid on it and
seal it for like two weeks and don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of those flies comes out,
hits that sticky trap, and doesn't go
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that totally works to try to keep that
population down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you notice that same thing like with
your vermicompost bin, sometimes you open
[SPEAKER_01]: it and it only takes one little fly to get
in there and mess things up for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it when that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my vermicompost bin indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a plastic tote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some holes poked all around the top and
all around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filled it up with, well, I had an old
10-gallon pot that I was using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just used that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put in a whole bunch of plant material
to give it time to die out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added in a handful of bokashi to give it
the plant material to break down and then
[SPEAKER_01]: some kitchen food scraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do worms also like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oatmeal, cornmeal, stuff like that added
in like a little treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of an avocado, preferably slightly
rotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's mushier, they get in there
quicker, I've noticed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put in a fresh avocado, they're not
going anywhere near it because maybe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: too hard for them to break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to speed up your worm
population, that's an easy way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, vermicompost is really amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is high in bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just something to consider
depending on which types of plants you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because annuals, things like that,
usually like really high bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and soil to grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, trees, shrubs, or your
perennials usually like more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi-dominant soil to grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a ratio of bacteria to fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your annuals like more bacteria and your
perennials like more fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But vermicompost is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a lot of bacteria and the worm
castings are coated with polysaturides and
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates and simple proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So vermicompost is really rich in
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can help retain moisture and it helps
the soil, like soil structure and
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning of soil too, might be able to
help get rid of some pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime anyone is mixing up new soil that
they want to start a new garden in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should add vermicompost, which is worm
castings, and regular compost like cow
[SPEAKER_01]: manure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like native soil because of the
sand, silt, and clay that's involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need that for cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I like mixing the compost in with
that and then putting a topsoil on top and
[SPEAKER_01]: then waiting about two weeks and then
putting your plants into that topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're ready, they'll go after that
compost and they'll just be sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: waiting for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vermicompost is a really easy way to take
care of getting rid of kitchen scraps or
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to use it for tea if you want to
give it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular composting can take a bit longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hot composting and then there's
cold composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot composting, it's ready pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really hot and it really cooks and
you've got to turn it and mix it so that
[SPEAKER_01]: way what was in the center is now on the
outside and what was on the outside is now
[SPEAKER_01]: in the center to even it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything about composting or the soil food
web, I would highly recommend checking out
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Elaine Ingham's videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes into so much detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is her jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: She loves talking about the soil food web
and composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Loansville, the guy that wrote this
book, he took her course and got into
[SPEAKER_01]: composting and the soil food web with her
and highly recommends checking her out as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like doing cold composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I'm doing myself or I call it
the lazy compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you're just putting a layer
of browns in and a layer of greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you've got kitchen scraps,
you put it on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got specific type of manures,
this year I have used aged horse manure
[SPEAKER_01]: and I layered it like a lasagna.
[SPEAKER_01]: Browns include anything that's dead,
like dead leaves, dead weeds, cardboard,
[SPEAKER_01]: paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things can be decomposed really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your trash, that's mainly paper material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got your greens, which
basically means anything alive,
[SPEAKER_01]: like plants that were alive, food that you
had to eat in your kitchen scraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's considered a green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greens offer more nitrogen and browns
offer more carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I like to do a nice layer of
both when I'm doing my cold composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sprinkle a handful of Bokashi on it to
get it rocking and rolling a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just sit there and leave it be outside
and I don't have to mess with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to turn it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do anything but wait for
time and it'll just break itself down to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point that you now have this really
rich brown material that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: most of it is unrecognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't have been able to tell really
what went into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could use that compost the same way
you could use vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could sprinkle it around your garden
beds, like put it on top, as long as it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a few inches away from the stem of any of
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can make a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my favorite ways to do it
because if you only have so much compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really want it to spread and last a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using just a handfuls and making a tea
out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could apply it often, but I personally
only do a tea once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with indoors on the beds that I have,
I'm slowly starting to back off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I've been doing compost teas for
so long in these beds, they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need any more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to keep on reapplying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to learn about growing in
a bed versus growing outdoors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground where it's a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a bed, you have this controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you put things in there, it doesn't
leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas outdoors, it could go somewhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the next soil or somewhere else or
deeper into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to be very careful not to
overdo it with the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: A really light tea once a week is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are reusing your soil, watch out
after doing it for so many runs or so many
[SPEAKER_01]: years if you're doing it in a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, probably not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people have applied top
amendments and some people have watered
[SPEAKER_01]: with compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after so many years, their soil is
just so enriched with microbial life that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't need to do anything other than
to keep it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where that magic happens,
where you've already done so much to your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's totally hooked up and you don't
need to do anything else to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than just keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost and vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super simple, easy ways to put nutrients
and microbials back into your soil and let
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbials do all the work for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started my vermicompost bin,
it's very similar to what you explained,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got the bin, poke holes in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a screen on the inside so
things don't escape out those holes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holes around the top as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to start it, I did a pretty
standard, a lot of people do this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the brick of cocoa mixed with some
shredded paper or some people use shredded
[SPEAKER_00]: cardboard as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mixing that all together, adding in
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buying worms from Uncle Jim's worm
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought the red wigglers and I bought the
European night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So diversity is what I was aiming for
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then adding in your inputs,
the greens and brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally for greens, what I'll add is
I'll add in just any kind of leftover
[SPEAKER_00]: salad stuff that isn't eaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything, real green vegetables goes in
the bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also add in eggshells and I add in a lot
of coffee grounds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of the main things that come
to mind that I typically add in the bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically I'll do it on a weekly
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of you're wondering
frequency, how often should you be adding
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get to a point where you
put too much in there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like too much food for the worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can have a lot of gnats flying around
or pests flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it can really turn into a bad
environment if you aren't doing things
[SPEAKER_00]: right, which is something that I quickly
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a nap problem for a while,
but I ended up balancing things out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, and getting more aeration
down there and the moisture level
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I feel like things are going
pretty good there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but normally I'll add stuff in on a
weekly basis and I'll kind of rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: around on the different sections of the
bin, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, maybe the top right
corner, I'll do one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next week I'll go to the bottom
right corner and then I'll kind of rotate
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the time I get back down to that
corner that I started in, it's usually
[SPEAKER_00]: broken down at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm able to add in more in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had it for about four months so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't feel like I'm able to take
things from that bin yet and use it for
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it takes longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people say they don't even
start pulling stuff out of there until
[SPEAKER_00]: like a year into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure what your take on that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like six months or a year or when
do you start using compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're saying this time of year,
it's a lot colder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they might not be working so fast
because they're not moving a whole lot
[SPEAKER_01]: versus during the summertime when they're
warmer, they are working a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are going through and composting
everything for you a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other trick, I think we were talking
about this last time we did our show was
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of just, you could just put your
food scraps in there, but instead of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you could also put them in a blender
so that they're already broken down and
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely available to all the worms and
other microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not just worms that make up
that worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the fungi and the bacteria and other
things breaking it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the worms come and eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said with the avocado, the worms
did not want to touch a nice, fresh,
[SPEAKER_01]: hard avocado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted it to be partially starting to
turn brown, a little bit rotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like citrus stuff, I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't like the orange peel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or lemon peels or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't eat it or go near it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just like throwing in apples and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like cornmeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, I've watched so many videos on
vermicomposting and there's this sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: English lady that loved her worm bin and
would go on about all these treats she was
[SPEAKER_01]: giving her worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, I love to give you treats like
the cornmeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about that every time I go to
open up my worm bin when it's time to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them a little food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, give me a little cornmeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take a while until you can
actually reap the rewards of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicompost bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you do have it going and you get
it and you understand it, then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of keep maybe two bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this bin is ready to be harvested a
little bit out of while this bin is
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just a super, super easy way to put
more micronutrients and microbial life
[SPEAKER_01]: back into your soil that's readily
available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a step towards a closed loop
operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then same thing with the outdoor
composting in the cold compost pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms will make their way up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that outdoor compost pile also has worm
doo-doos in it also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are totally good to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, if you're outdoors,
you don't need both the outdoor pile and a
[SPEAKER_01]: worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my worm bin for the indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi is also fermented organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely, extremely easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot like the whole IMO process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for with Bokashi, they use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They buy that bottle of EM1 from
Terrigenics and they take that,
[SPEAKER_01]: they put it in a big old five gallon
bucket of water with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses and stir it up real nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they use that water to soak malted
bran or malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use that water to soak malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you let that sit and ferment in a
plastic baggie for like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, you take it out and
then you let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a few days and you turn it so
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once it's completely dry, you now have
like Bokashi that can be put in a bag or a
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could buy Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Kashi Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me show you what it looks like on
the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi is another really amazing,
great tool that you could use the same way
[SPEAKER_01]: as like other composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it on top of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it right next to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help increase the microbial
population.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help with fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help with the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts a lot of nutrients and enzymes and
whatnot back into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, this is what Bokashi looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Grow Kashi, which is a brand of it,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's by Growing Organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one has the rice bran,
a lot of other wheat bran and insect
[SPEAKER_01]: frass, molasses, and then the EM.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they put other stuff in here like
biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And high nitrogen amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the compost and the Bokashi,
once you have enough, you don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep reapplying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just something that you don't
need to do too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit is good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I personally love using this Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've seen a lot of people showing off
their soils and you see the little fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: little mycelium growing, and they say,
man, ever since I put that Bokashi down,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's exactly what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a recipe that I wanted to give
your viewers with the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You basically get, and you can buy compost
or worm castings from your local grow
[SPEAKER_01]: store or online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be careful about it not being out in
the sun or direct sunlight or getting too
[SPEAKER_01]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this recipe is really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one cup of Olie Mountain compost a
half a cup of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a handful of Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix all that together along with two
tablespoons of oatmeal flour and one
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoon of rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh yeah, two tablespoons of barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I use gnarly barley from Clackamas
Coop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mix all that together,
you get a little bit wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put this up on my Instagram page today
just to show everybody the recipe and how
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it together, you get it a little
bit moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you put it in a container with a
cover on, but not all the way on,
[SPEAKER_01]: just slightly on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you wait for about three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to be in a warm but dark location
so that the fungi on it can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made this three days ago so I could
show you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually if you're storing this,
I leave the lid like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way a little bit of air could get
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lid's not completely sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what happens three days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see this nice mycelium?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go out to the forest and you're
trying to get a collection of indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, this is what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally prefer just all sorts of a
variety, a diverse variety of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this, see how nice and soft this is?
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of smells like apple cider
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it Santa's beard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in that Teaming with Microbes book,
he shows you how you can make this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This recipe I got off my friend Random
Nicole 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would do when it's time,
[SPEAKER_01]: see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breaking it right open there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's time, I put this in a tea bag
and I make a tea out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will create a fungi-rich compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is good for plants that love
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could feed this tea to any of your
plants because fungi life lasts for so
[SPEAKER_01]: long as long as you maintain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely gonna have to take that
recipe and try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will send it to you, but I'm telling
you, it's the coolest thing ever if you
[SPEAKER_01]: make this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've tried a few different ways to get
it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just cold and dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I wouldn't eat this, but it does
smell really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminds me of fruit or apple cider
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it smells good, it's good to
work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it starts smelling really nasty or
funky, then it's no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nice thing about bokashi, one of the
things that it does is it helps to get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of all that smell, funky smells of
anything, and it helps them to break down
[SPEAKER_01]: faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has created a lot of fungi life,
a lot of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of great things in here that
I could use and put in my tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this tea I give to my plants
about once a week until I notice that my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants have had too much by checking out
their leaves, then I start backing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to share that recipe with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you guys can make it and give it a
try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you find any way to make this any
more white than what I can do,
[SPEAKER_01]: then please share your recipe with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have to try that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love how there's so many different ways
to go about feeding these plants or
[SPEAKER_00]: providing care for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about so many things that are
your non-traditional way of growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it opens up your mind and it makes
things fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say non-traditional, but that's the
funny thing, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did we switch from our traditional
simple ways of farming to go to this new
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that we had to go out and buy
nutrients from bottles?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go into details, but I'm not going
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerative farming is what I'm getting
into right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not totally deep into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who am I kidding?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm super thankful to have you on here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wrapping things up, how can the listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Instagram, Green's
Goddess.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, let's see, right now I'm
getting into some bubble hash,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm still processing things from the
freezer from outdoor season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soon as the weather starts warming up,
I'm going to be working on my yard because
[SPEAKER_01]: I got all these seeds from Neverwinter
Farms and now I got to grow all this food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing that I'm going to be
working on a lot more of these IMO
[SPEAKER_01]: collections and just watering my yard,
my backyard with that to hook up the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it ready for me to start planting
food in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd really like to look
forward to this coming up season is making
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more plants, making a lot more
healthy food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, plants are medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to help people heal and I don't
think people should pay an arm and a leg
[SPEAKER_01]: for some apples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apples should taste good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to your
