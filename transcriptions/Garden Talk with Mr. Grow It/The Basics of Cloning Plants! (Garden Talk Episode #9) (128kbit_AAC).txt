[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually use water in my cloning
process because I'm pretty assembly line
[SPEAKER_01]: with it when I take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in, you know, to where they're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I do after my 45 degree
angle is a light, light abrasion,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually upward on the kind of surrounding
stem area from that 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with aeroponics, if I wait too
long and I mess around and I have hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, that transition into my cocoa
blend with peat is a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they get a little wonky on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they might shoot a yellow leaf
or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might get a little upset with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the quickest way if you can get it
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if it's not dialed in and you're
having fluctuation and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be a headache and make you feel
like you don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and this is Garden
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk, episode 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode's guest is Trey Strongs.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is most known for his YouTube channel,
Cannabis Lifestyle TV, which currently has
[SPEAKER_02]: 270 videos that have over 11 million views
combined and 124,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is also the host of Elevated Chef,
which is an effuse cooking show.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he owns a hydroponics shop in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we talk about the basics
of cloning, all the way from how to cut
[SPEAKER_02]: clones, the environment that clones should
be put in, different ways to clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into the episode,
I'd like to give a quick shout out to our
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big thanks to Happy Hydro for sponsoring
this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually recently launched their own
YouTube channel and they're posting videos
[SPEAKER_02]: on a weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron, who is their host, he puts a fun
spin on Grow Light reviews.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also doing part tests,
unboxing videos, and how-to videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do me a favor and show them some love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go subscribe to their YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be one of the first subscribers to that
channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll link it down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you can always check out
happyhydro.com for popular brands like AC
[SPEAKER_02]: Infinity, Gross Choice, Spider Farmer,
Chiltek, Gorilla, Blue Mat, and more.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, let's get into the
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Trey?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing all right, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been requested by a few people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you're part of the CLTV
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you and Rob are doing big things
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had Rob on actually the first episode,
which was last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that episode, I think is the one
where people are like, oh, we need to get
[SPEAKER_02]: Trey on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally got you on here for once.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I was going to say time flies
because I feel like that was like last
[SPEAKER_01]: month that he was on your channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that video pop up quite a few
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I can hope is that I do some sort
of diligence to him who came before me
[SPEAKER_01]: representing the CL fam.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, no pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so to start, for those that don't know
who you are, can you tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about yourself and kind of how you got
into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Trey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm passionate about failing cannabis and
culinary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all subsets of my life come from those
passions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, is why I have been
dedicated to cannabis lifestyle and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis lifestyle TV and all the things
that have branched off from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, I've always.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my first interaction with the plant,
I've been like the plant, not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower, but the plant have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fascinated by it, I guess, you know,
it's like the closest thing to a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I have, but for the longest time,
it wasn't really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, something you outwardly was
like, yeah, my hobby is growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool to say that I think I can
probably say that we've been a part,
[SPEAKER_01]: a small part in that footstep of like
breaking the stigma and having it be kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of somewhat normalcy to, you know,
have that small at home garden and just
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out on how different ways to tweak
it and make it better, which is what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing for the past decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I mean, that's me in a nutshell,
as far as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, obviously, if any of you
have watched the channel, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a good, a great relationship with
culinary, which I've melded with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: many, many times over, which I also feel
like is another subset of those two
[SPEAKER_01]: passions of mine.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also have a hydroponic store,
is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we, North Shore's hydroponic and
Holland hydroponic outlet, one and the
[SPEAKER_01]: same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're located in the West Michigan area,
West West West Coast area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we got four locations along,
along like a 60 mile strip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been helping people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Store's been around 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a part of it for about seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll put you through the trenches,
you know, just like even if I wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: growing kind of the do's and don'ts and
the the wheeze and won'ts, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's been.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an apprenticeship almost,
in a sense, again, because you are in a
[SPEAKER_01]: time that it wasn't as trendy as it is
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, of course, you have those
instances where.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people are kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Driven for one sense or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards gardening, and so you find that
kind of ugly side of it, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really great gardening community out of it
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool, and I'm sure it's like that with
like the automotive community or any niche
[SPEAKER_01]: interest, right, is you kind of have to
work your way into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your name is really all you have to go
by is what the community says you are good
[SPEAKER_01]: at or not so good at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't had too many bad reviews in
the sense of that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, that's a sense of pride for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that's why people
come back to us, because you can get you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get gardening grow equipment from
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the knowledge that you seek for your
garden at the time of need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's what makes you so much of
an influence on not only YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just the growing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that's what's going to kind
of speak volumes over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the topic today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk all about cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a variety of people that watch
my channel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Beginners, intermediate, advanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it's more geared towards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like a majority of the audience
are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beginner like so in this episode,
I really just want to kind of cover the
[SPEAKER_02]: basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can get into more advanced things
in a different episode, but let's cover
[SPEAKER_02]: the basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first off, what is cloning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's essentially keeping around
whatever form of plant you have and
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially by cutting off a piece of that
plant and trying to have that established
[SPEAKER_01]: root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, a root zone so that you can
keep keep whatever it is you got going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think that's in the simplest
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cutting off a branch and rooting it is
really what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at what point do you clone?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, do you take clones in early veg,
late veg, flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you take clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, you know, when I ran that
question, I'm like, well, like mid veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not, you know, not not Papa Bear,
not Mama Bear or not Baby Bear or Middle
[SPEAKER_01]: Bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say I like to have a plant be
well established, I guess, before I I take
[SPEAKER_01]: a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say I'm a mid veg, not early
veg, because I feel like and they,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, depending on, you know,
the resiliency of your plant, you may not
[SPEAKER_01]: need that long a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, depending on what kind of plant
you're cloning, I'm sure everyone has a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, I would say mid veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually do mid veg as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it at any point, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Early veg, you can do it maybe like,
I would say probably the earliest I would
[SPEAKER_02]: ever take clones is around day 20,
25 ish.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be like real early to take
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, you can definitely do it in late
veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it in flower as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't know that you can
actually take clones in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called monster crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you have to actually go through
the re-vegging process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it takes a little bit longer to get
back into that re-vegging process and take
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can certainly still take clones
while in the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not really ideal because it
takes a little bit longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw that option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just touched on this actually on
our live, I believe on Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: customer of mine who clones conifer trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gets like $600 a clone and he'll
take like 600 clones and he'll only get
[SPEAKER_01]: six though, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like not the greatest succession
rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say I just don't want to go
through that much time and effort and
[SPEAKER_01]: energy and left it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the cream of the crop worth that
monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monster cropping and re-veg time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the re-veg time can be quite a
long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Situational, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people aren't going to have the
space, you know, to have an 18-6 light
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle, a veg light cycle going and a
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe they put all their plants in a
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they realize, hey, this feno is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to keep it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that point, maybe they cut clones at
that point, you know, late flower to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of keep those genetics around.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely situational for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can the plant be showing deficiencies
when you clone it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you bring up a good adjective there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Situational, which I feel like is going to
be kind of a couple of these answers for
[SPEAKER_01]: me, which it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, again, those trench,
in the trenches days that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just shown me like the really,
and I guess that's great because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: built a community and kind of a existence
on this, but there's no one answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, if it's a phenotype or a cultivar
that is just, and I, for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any other way to keep it around
and it has an issue, it's showing signs of
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, maybe has some sort of
pest issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll clone it, you know, if it's coming to
kind of a T in the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had my perfect situation,
I would wait for it to be healthy to
[SPEAKER_01]: bounce back because obviously those issues
are only going to translate down into that
[SPEAKER_01]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to be dang near
impossible to kind of supersede those
[SPEAKER_01]: issues if they are so severe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, if a plant is showing me
signs of that, it's probably not something
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping around to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, dependent on the situation,
yes, but like initial answer, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think there's a, I think that's a
common argument is if the plant is showing
[SPEAKER_02]: any type of deficiencies, it's showing a
sign of weakness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think general knowledge is you don't
want to actually take clones at that
[SPEAKER_02]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've read quite a few books and one of
the things I have some notes here,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the books that I've read,
I'm not sure if you're familiar with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: The Growers Bible, Jorge Savante's Growers
Bible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually in that one, quote,
clones quickly develop a root system when
[SPEAKER_02]: the stems have a high carbohydrate and low
nitrogen concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is an argument out there that if
you're a little bit deficient in nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're actually going to root faster,
which I thought was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'd never put it to the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done any side by sides or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, for those people who think
that any sign of deficiencies is a
[SPEAKER_02]: weakness and you shouldn't clone at that
point, there is actually some evidence out
[SPEAKER_02]: there or people out there or experts in
our field out there that are saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's a little bit deficient,
you know, particularly in nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's actually a good thing and actually
speed up rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I was going to say sometimes
when you take a clone, they will obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: show signs of nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So almost having a plant that might
already be established to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, might do well, you know,
because depending on, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the length of time it takes your plant to
develop roots, you know, it usually you
[SPEAKER_01]: are not hitting it with a bunch of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not having a bunch of access to
resource necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's almost like,
you know, a kid that's been in the streets
[SPEAKER_01]: already, you know, so it's like they're
going to survive a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I guess I've done no side by
sides, but I have been in that situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where actually a couple of months ago I
had, I didn't have to shut down the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, but I had to revamp it and I had
some genetics that I wanted to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: around, but they were a little stressed
because I was pretty focused on my
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I took those plants that
weren't so great and I cloned them out
[SPEAKER_01]: just to keep the cultivars around and they
cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, you know, Jorge knows quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've obviously referenced it a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like the Bible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't run it from like cover to cover,
but you know, I've definitely referenced
[SPEAKER_01]: it and that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you don't think about these things
that you've done necessarily in the garden
[SPEAKER_01]: until you, you know, are talking about it,
so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now for probably one of the most beginner
questions, very common beginner questions,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you clone an auto flower plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went into my own conversation with this
question like off camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, because I've never
done auto flowers, because that's my
[SPEAKER_01]: initial like, nope, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't grow that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that I've grown, I have not been
very impressed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just kind of there and they did
their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done a couple sun grown as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I feel like they have the
most value personally for the region in
[SPEAKER_01]: which I grow as well as the type of
gardener that I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of people doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't personally done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't personally run auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try to get better with that
because they haven't actually done
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to me personally, but it kind of
feels like it because when you dedicate
[SPEAKER_01]: time and energy to a plant and it comes
out like Charlie Brown Christmas tree,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, what the heck is going on
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of what I, you know,
that's the type of guy I am too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't do so well with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will probably pick up that challenge
again, you know, if the situation opens
[SPEAKER_01]: itself to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as me cloning auto flowers,
no, I have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been people out there that have
successfully done so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe that that's what they were
inceptionalized to do though.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were developed to do exactly the
opposite of that, to be planted,
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow, to bloom and to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what they're meant to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you tweak that cycle is very pertinent
and I haven't gotten it down yet
[SPEAKER_01]: personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are gardeners out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple of customers that that's
all they grow and they love it and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing pretty well from what I can see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I think technically you can,
um, you can clone an auto flower plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, is it ideal to do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to get a great result?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to get a high yield,
high yield from doing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you're cutting a clone,
say you cut a clone around day 25,
[SPEAKER_02]: right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, typical auto flower is going to start
flowering around what day 30, day 40 or so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's on that, uh, certain lifespan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's not like you control the amount
of time it's in veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the light cycle, like you do with photo
period plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're cutting a clone around day 25
off an auto flower plant, you can get it
[SPEAKER_02]: to root for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now the thing is it's going to be
flowering pretty quickly because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, photo periodism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might have a small plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it's like, well, is he,
is he even worth it to clone autos or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So technically it's possible, but yeah,
you got to ask yourself, is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it really worth the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it really worth, you know, the space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, maybe it is for some people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know for those who are viewing
this, have you cloned an auto flower plant
[SPEAKER_02]: before?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, is that something that you
practice?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'd love to hear it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure we'll hear somebody that says,
oh yeah, I clone all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are those not anomalies in
the system, but like I say, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners out there that make things
happen that I don't see in the mass
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage or popularity, but it's
definitely, you know, done for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do cut clones, does the clone
need to be a certain size?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have like, do you cut a certain
size of a clone or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes, would be like my golden boy
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but like, do they vary?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you mentioned a couple of minutes ago,
I've taken whole plants and turned them
[SPEAKER_01]: all into clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, you know, the side, the size
differentiation there is going to vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, ideally, um, when I clone,
I take same size clones so that they all
[SPEAKER_01]: grow evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is my thought process behind that or
why I do it in that method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it kind of varies too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have different, um, phenotypes or
cultivars next to each other in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning bed, then they vary no matter what
size I take them at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, certain, uh, genetics are going
to root faster and grow quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I had some, uh, plants that were in my
aeroponic corner that pretty much turned
[SPEAKER_01]: into hydroponic plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, um, it's not impossible,
uh, to, to have success, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, without keeping it the same size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it helps you if you try to,
um, just like in cooking, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to cut things to the same size so
that they all cook evenly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have it more, uh, kind of rough,
it's going to cook that same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for me, generally what I'll do is,
you know, roughly maybe six to eight
[SPEAKER_02]: inches is what I'll cut for a clone
roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there are people, but people out there
who have cut off two foot branches and
[SPEAKER_02]: then clone that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's possible, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I have, it depends on if I'm
breaking down a plant, if I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just trying to, to take an even,
I try to be even about it, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: situational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'm going to steal that word from
you for this episode, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to, I usually will cut like a decent
size off of the plant and then shorten
[SPEAKER_01]: that into a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go for fairly that same size,
but they, some of them vary, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know you said that you've taken
clones from an entire plant before,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally, what part of the plant do
you take clones from?
[SPEAKER_01]: My entryway into cloning was, you know,
bottom of the bottom of the canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, um, or lower half of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where I tried to start at,
but sometimes I wouldn't say sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the time when I'm taking
clones, I'll look at that plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: also start to like prune that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there are certain branches that I'm
going to discard anyway, they might become
[SPEAKER_01]: a clone in the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are those times, but most of the
time it's because I'm snipping,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, clones off of that branch
already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, usually the lower half of the
plant I would say is like my 80% go-to
[SPEAKER_01]: unless I'm breaking down a whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can definitely, um, you know,
just to back up a minute, you can
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely take clones from any part of
the plant if you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but I am going to actually quote Jorge
Cervantes again, you know, in his book,
[SPEAKER_02]: he has just this section on cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember when I first read it,
I was like, wow, I didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and one of the things was clones from
the lower branches root the easiest
[SPEAKER_02]: because they contain more of the proper
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what it says in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically the lower part of the plant
is apparently the easiest to root as the
[SPEAKER_02]: newest hormones, middle part of the plant,
easier, easier to root next to oldest
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then upper part of the plant,
most difficult clones to root oldest
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming straight out of his book.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured I'd bring that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if a lot of people know that
or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there is some stuff in his book that's
inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't say that this is a hundred
percent accurate, but, um, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what it says in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I thought was interesting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's, there's so much information
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I think too, again, cause I grew
my, uh, in gardening terms, I grew up off
[SPEAKER_01]: of Jorge Cervantes and Ed Rosen's on and
guys who learned strictly off of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, that was a different time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, you know, almost two decades
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's just been so much more
revelation and information and science
[SPEAKER_01]: done, um, that any plant, you know,
that cuts across more than just ones we
[SPEAKER_01]: may be talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, there's a lot of things,
like you say, that can be inaccurate now
[SPEAKER_01]: or debunked in a sense, but, um,
cause that same thing I've had clones root
[SPEAKER_01]: from the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they take a little bit longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't take a record of it,
but probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: So interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, when you cut the clones, a common
technique is to cut it at a 45 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, you know, when I go to take
that longer piece of the plant and I snip
[SPEAKER_01]: it down, that's when I make my 45 degree
angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefit of that is the only
information bank I have is from my mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, who ran a floral shop for many,
many moons, many, many moons before I was
[SPEAKER_01]: a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, where I get a lot of my kind of
green thumb from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time she would bring fresh
flowers into the house, which she always
[SPEAKER_01]: had to have, uh, she would always cut it
at that same 45 degree angle, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: every single stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, it does expose
surface area, but how she explained it to
[SPEAKER_01]: me is there for those plants that,
they were able to more readily drink or
[SPEAKER_01]: eat or like go for resource in the base
that they were in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the same thing applies when you're
talking about taking a clone is you
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting a fresh as most, as you can get it
as close as you can get it sterile part to
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant to start that root zone from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two cents.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's a common technique of
basically at the end of the clone to split
[SPEAKER_02]: the end, uh, it supposedly gets more roots
that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a common thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing would be to scrape off like
the inch or two of the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_02]: clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, to kind of help with surface
area, help with, with rooting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do any of those techniques at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I, and there's nothing wrong
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people do, there's definitely
gardeners out there who get success from
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I wasn't ever taught that.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my kind of OB one into, into
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but also I just, I, the time or two
that I've done it, it's so much stress on
[SPEAKER_01]: the clone that I haven't seen good results
come back from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it be beneficial to one,
my rooting time or to just overall health
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have had a couple of people help me
clone and when they, they've gone to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I'm like, no, it's like,
pretty nerve wracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but no, I, I, I, the only thing I do
after my 45 degree angle is a light,
[SPEAKER_01]: light abrasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually upward on the, um,
kind of surrounding stem area from that 45
[SPEAKER_01]: degree angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I dip into my rooting hormone or
rooting compound and, um, go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, that that's worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, I think it's just enough
ruffling on that edge to get that,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh crap, we need energy here, which is
what you're creating when you,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you take that clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's not so much that it's hard
for the plant or for the potential plant
[SPEAKER_01]: to recover.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually, I usually scrape the bottom
inch or two at the very bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, with the hopes that that
roots would be possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think I've ever done the split
at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think I've ever done it
before, but maybe I have, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember every single plant I've grown,
every single thing I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't, we weren't recording every
single time that we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were just, I mean, a lot of my early
garden career was just throwing crap at
[SPEAKER_01]: the wall and hoping that it would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, I think we can both agree that
the, the scraping of the light abrasion is
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how you go about that, I guess I
wouldn't say I, the only thing I would say
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do personally is like completely
scrape it down to kind of the meat,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what I think could be translated
from the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not that you can't do it, you know,
plants are pretty fricking resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of crazy what they go through
with what we put them through or
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Successfully, I think as far as like
cutting into that, like upwardly and not
[SPEAKER_01]: just doing the scrape or doing both,
but I think favoring one or the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just a lot for the plant to
recover from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, after you cut the clone, it's
generally advised.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just about any resource you read
online, it's advised to immediately put
[SPEAKER_02]: that clone into water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, what are the reasons why to
potentially dip it immediately into water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I got the answer here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need me to give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead and give it to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so you want to prevent air from
getting into those hollow stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's called embolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so basically it's a bubble of air that
gets trapped in the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: When that happens, fluid stops and then
the clone dies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it's generally advised to
just stick that clone directly into water
[SPEAKER_02]: to prevent that air bubble from getting
into the actual hollow stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's my understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, learn something new every day that
what I know is that again, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's keeping it sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I didn't know exactly about the,
the air bubble effect, but again,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me it's a contaminant factor,
you know, and I, I understood that fact
[SPEAKER_01]: of, um, like you're taking these clones,
you want it to be sterile from the cut all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way until it's in whatever medium
you're putting it into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can help one of the people who
was helping me take the clones was making
[SPEAKER_01]: the cut actually underwater and,
you know, cutting it upward and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, no, I ain't got time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have success without doing all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the only thing I would say I use water
for is if I'm, Hey, these need,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to, um, take clones of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me take the branch off and stick
them in a solo cup with pH water until I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: able to take the clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I will kind of soak my cuts in
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually use water in my cloning
process because I'm pretty assembly line
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take clones, it's in, in,
you know, to where they're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have like a, a span in time where
I have to necessarily worry about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know some people, instead of going
into water, instead of dipping it directly
[SPEAKER_02]: into water as quickly as they can,
they'll go directly into a rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so what is a rooting hormone?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that was what I was going to look up,
but I believe it's like, um, do regic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know the homie goblin,
he uses just like, um, aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I know there's a couple of,
of gardeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: That practice that actually, I know
there's some people who don't use a
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting hormone at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I know I butchered that word,
but it's some sort of acid in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a gelatinous form, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, quite simply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's something that's going to
help the, the clone root faster is really
[SPEAKER_02]: what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there are several different types.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we won't get into too details as a
little bit more advanced, but NAA,
[SPEAKER_02]: IBA, DPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, those are three different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually use the IBA ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then you've got the, you know,
the liquid solutions versus the gel
[SPEAKER_02]: solutions versus the powder solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any ones in particular that you
usually do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I guess what also a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a particular brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I chuckle is because certain
customers are so dead set on like clone X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you don't got clone X.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll have root tech instead,
you know, just cause sometimes the
[SPEAKER_01]: inventory varies.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it's like lucky Jim socks to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's, it's rooting gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like when you get a new clone
and you get easy, uh, or yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: easy clones version, which is a rooting
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried Diana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried root tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't, I don't think I've actually
ever even used clone X cloning gel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't cause it's purple and it weirds
me out, but, um, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had success with all the ones I've
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't, I don't see a difference
personally, you know, coming from a guy
[SPEAKER_01]: who runs a hydroshop four days out of the
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, there's no difference to me
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only thing I would add to that
is I usually use like the, the liquid of
[SPEAKER_02]: the gel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the powder, um, you know,
sometimes it doesn't get directly onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom of the clone as nicely as the,
the liquid of the gel does.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I feel like that's eluded me cause
I've had customers come in, you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any rooting powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, no, like that's a dated,
in my opinion, form of, of doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: taking clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even stock a rooting powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the closest thing to a rooting powder
I have is great white, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once I dip into my rooting,
um, rooting hormone, um, I then will roll
[SPEAKER_01]: my, my clones into great white.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it almost comes down to, it just
creates like a paste on the end of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, my clone, which is also why I don't
use any water or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like everything that gets sucked up
into that little situation ship right
[SPEAKER_01]: there, uh, is, you know, a combination of
that, uh, rooting hormone and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and great white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause great white is like powdered sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it cakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's several different methods for
rooting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can simply cut the clone off the plant
directly, stick it directly into the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium, which I've done in the past,
of course, using, you know, rooting
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones, which you just talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, um, stick it in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use root riots, aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can actually stick that clone
directly into a cup of water and leave it
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cup of water and then actually root
in that water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what method do you typically use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I haven't ever had roots come from
just sticking it in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who have, but I have not had
that amount of green thumb action
[SPEAKER_01]: personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I've done them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, except for grow Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't personally done it, but my
brother who I garden with now,
[SPEAKER_01]: he, he uses them and they're, they're just
like any other soilless cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a little bit of technique
when you're talking about soaking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I started my cloning career in root
riots or soilless peak cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find those to be personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the more beginner friendly or less
vulnerable ways to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, personally, um, the only difference is
kind of how I've graduated to how I do it
[SPEAKER_01]: used to just take them out of the bag,
take the clones, stick them in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: go, um, now I will typically soak them in
a solution that has some form of great
[SPEAKER_01]: white or orca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in it, because like I mentioned,
I do the dip and roll in my aeroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that does not work so well when you go
to shove something into a peak cube with a
[SPEAKER_01]: hole that's really tiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just make sure that the great white
is just already absorbed into the puck or
[SPEAKER_01]: the peak cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, aeroponic cloning, uh, when she works,
she's a beaut.
[SPEAKER_01]: When she doesn't, it can really be a punch
to the gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, uh, my other, like binary
relationship with any kind of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it can be great in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's bad, it can be very bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you can get it good,
it is like one of the most streamlined
[SPEAKER_01]: ways to clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that they're happy that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you're talking about the other
spectrum, just like taking it off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and sticking it into like some sort
of dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've done that when I'm like,
if you make it, you make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, that's kind of how I've,
how I've done that form of cloning
[SPEAKER_01]: personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I know a lot of gardeners who
that's just how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, a plant is so resilient and you
can have success with it in any of those
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of that I've talked about or.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, dropping the comments,
maybe otherwise that you've cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know customers who clone on the plant,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's, there's a lot of different
forms, but you know, going back to just
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking it in the, in the dirt,
just like cutting it when you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: that cut up the plant, it's a lot for your
plant to overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your, your root time, your root
development time, I just have found
[SPEAKER_01]: personally to be so far extrapolated from
kind of the more primitive way of going
[SPEAKER_01]: about it, that that's not how I practice
my gardening because it would just be so
[SPEAKER_01]: stunted and, and not consistent and not
perpetual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the whole reason that I got
into cloning is so that I could keep
[SPEAKER_01]: certain cultivars or phenotypes around
that I could keep the garden perpetual and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep growing and keep hunting and,
and, and flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think aeroponics has been the
best in that sense, the most streamlined.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have had certain phenotypes that
just do not take to that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to venture into other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, whether it be sticking it straight in
or, or using, uh, soilless cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's situational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get like five cents every time we
say that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, when you're talking
about preference, aeroponics for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: right next to that, you know, tried and
true for me is, is going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: soilless peak cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've had people see, or seen people
have really great success in the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: dance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just always used to call those things
black magic cause it didn't make any sense
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they were not always as popular as
they are now with Instagram and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I think what's nice with those is
it allows you the ability to go into any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other thing is like when you
start a, a clone in a peak cube,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go into soil fairly well going
into hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the grow dance, I've seen them that,
that transfer shock be a little less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with aeroponics, if I wait too
long and I mess around and I have hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that transition into my cocoa blend
with Pete is a little bit of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get a little wonky on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they might shoot a yellow leaf
or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might get a little upset with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, versus having that transition be more
mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's, it's genetic plant
dependent, but gardener dependent,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So digging a little bit deep into
aeroponics, um, what should the pH of the
[SPEAKER_02]: water be?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you actually use a solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned clone X earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use anything in the aeroponic
machine as far as solution solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for me, it's just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a little bit of orca and not really,
not when I, when I, when I initially set
[SPEAKER_01]: up my, my cloner as time goes on,
I'll add, um, clear res, I'll add a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of clone X solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just, I had some, I had some issues
with my, with my 32 site and, and I never
[SPEAKER_01]: used to you have to use clone X,
but my plants or my clones have just
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed to, again, maybe because it's
having that little bit of food in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving them a little bit of energy to use
for what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that has seemed to help me if I add
that a little bit later on, along with
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of beneficial microbial in
there, um, usually some liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I, I used to do great white in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have a whole, not concoction,
but I felt the need to dial it back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, simplify it because I wasn't
seeing the same success results that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, blending, I like kale and,
and great white and this and that in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, while all those things do help
your root process, like they have a time
[SPEAKER_01]: and a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just found that that has helped me
like to gradually add it, not make a big
[SPEAKER_01]: old solution that I'm running from jump.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it a specific pH that you do or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I try to stay around six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have this like battle where I
wanted to be at 5.8, but six is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know for aeroponics,
some people just have the sprayers on 24
[SPEAKER_02]: seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people put it on a timer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it comes on every so often.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I've never put my,
my aeroponic owner on a timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know a couple of, uh, grower buddies
who, uh, one of them, he, he has it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He sees, he doesn't see good results if he
doesn't have it on a timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he stays with that method pretty
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another buddy, uh, put his on a timer
thinking, okay, I'm going to, this is the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheat code, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just, it wasn't really successful
for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so he ended up kind of taking that
element out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I just keep them running.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, those, those pumps in there don't
like, I personally, I don't, I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: seen them like to go on and off and off
and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even, when I'm not using my clone or
haven't running.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's got just a solution of,
um, highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide
[SPEAKER_01]: and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so it's just cleaning itself
constantly, but I don't let those pumps
[SPEAKER_01]: dry up or dry out because they,
and obviously if a pump's coming on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to dry out, but those
things are just so, so finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, typically what light cycle do you
place the clones under 18, six,
[SPEAKER_02]: 24, 24, zero, 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think people do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there people out there that put it on
12, 12?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they do it for a short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they, they switched to 18,
six and believe or, or okay.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know in the comments if you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I, I'm 18 and six.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only kind of like light schedule
they're on is when they, I'm that first
[SPEAKER_01]: week, I kind of tuck them away from the
light because I just don't feel that they
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Direct light, you know, um, I have a
small, uh, chill tech led mini.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like it's perfect for cloning and I
turn it down, but I even like cock the
[SPEAKER_01]: cloner away from it just so that it's not
directly in that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously seasons depending
cause like temperature and things play a
[SPEAKER_01]: role, but, um, I've just found that they,
it's almost like, you know, you take that
[SPEAKER_01]: first week to sleep from recovery or
whatever, you know, like they don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: it right up under there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they, you can see that
they're, you know, I throw them under
[SPEAKER_01]: there and give them a decent amount of
light on that 18 and six.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I usually do 18, six too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was my next question is how much
light, um, do you typically give the
[SPEAKER_02]: clones and then, you know, talking about
spectrum, is there a certain spectrum that
[SPEAKER_02]: you like to give your clones in
particular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I, I was running under their mini
red and I mean, I had results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, there wasn't a single problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just the, the, the, you know,
whatever we, or excuse me, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant guru in me was like, there's a
reason why you have veg and bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrums, you know, as a, as a guy who
runs the hydros, I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, you know, so what's up with your
guys is blue spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, because I just, I feel like if you're,
if they're more established plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can play around with different
spectrums and even like, uh, infiltrating
[SPEAKER_01]: some more red spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as spring, like the almost time
that we're in now comes around,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get a bit more of those coming in than
you do from winter, you know, even,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or for instance, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't think it's the worst thing
in like, uh, mid to late veg, but early
[SPEAKER_01]: veg, I like to have that, that blue green
springy spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it talks about how much light
typically, you know, if we're talking par
[SPEAKER_02]: in PPFD in particular, I usually aim for
like 200, 200 to 400 PPFD for my clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, a little bit less than that actually
get away with, with the rooting process as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as the actual spectrum,
I do like to give it a blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we know that blue inhibits cell
division.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to lead to tighter node
spacing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that is, uh, something where you
generally hear that for the veg stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want more blue in the spectrum for the
flowering stage, more red in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I typically do go more on the blue side of
things when I'm, when I have clones
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as the environment,
let's get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, in your environment, what do you
typically aim for the temperature and the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity to be when rooting clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for like, when I'm rooting my soil
cubes, it's a little bit different for me
[SPEAKER_01]: than when you, when, when I'm running my
rooting in my aeroponic owner,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because when I'm rooting with the
soil cubes, I keep them underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity dome, almost the entirety that
they're rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're directly in is probably
closer to, you know, the tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, 80 degrees and, you know,
70 degrees or 60 degrees humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, cause I'm spraying it every day and
I'm keeping it very moist in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have to search for,
uh, water of any sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then with my aeroponic and with
any clone, I should say like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment should, should,
should match that to a degree dialed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't necessarily have to keep,
I don't keep a dome over my aeroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I do know gardeners who do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't personally, but I then want to
keep that area very inoculated to that
[SPEAKER_01]: germination like environment where it's,
you know, 70, 78 degrees and pretty humid
[SPEAKER_01]: because those little ones love that type
of like just, you know, encapsulated
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, you know, to do what they
need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature I usually aim for is between
like 75 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit is what
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually aim for when I'm, when I'm
rooting clones, uh, humidity, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: above 65%, um, you know, up to,
up to 90% for like the first day or so for
[SPEAKER_02]: the first 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if it's 90, 95% for the first 24,
48 hours, um, I've actually had pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: good luck doing that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I read in books as well as it's a
technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but yeah, kind of above the 65% is
kind of what I've had best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luck on now, some people I know they
monitor also the, the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, like I mentioned briefly earlier is
cutting a clone, stick it directly into
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of my primary way of doing
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just easy for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have an aeroponic clone or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, what I usually aim for, for a soil
level temperature or soil temperature is
[SPEAKER_02]: between 72 and 82 degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have tried to, probably the biggest
fail, um, is whenever I try to clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of a sudden the temperature is too
low when it's in like the soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium temperature is like in the
sixties.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it doesn't root anywhere near as
fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you'll keep the plant somewhat alive,
but it's just not going to root and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: see deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least that's been my experience doing
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I know you said you mostly do the
aeroponic side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a specific, um, water temperature
that you go by?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to say it, but I didn't
want to jump into your question too far,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, the temperature above shouldn't
drastically be different from below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're below temperature is
drastically below above, then you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have these weird plants that try to,
you know, shoot their roots upward because
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots want, you know, again,
that inoculated warm environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my aeroponic cloner, I tried to
stay in that like 70 to 72 degree water
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, anything lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have slowed root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no root growth dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's hard like to use the
aeroponic cloner successfully in a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent capacity and like the dry,
uh, hot, because you have the heat on
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, um, you know, or cold,
dry winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, in summer,
I usually have great success cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't necessarily need to be doing
that much in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's kind of a give or take,
but I would say, you know, I use,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, water bottles to regulate in
the, in the summertime when that pump
[SPEAKER_01]: creates too much, uh, warmth in the same
sense, you have to stay kind of regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: to get those roots exactly how you want
them to be in the time that you want them
[SPEAKER_01]: to be when you're talking aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, sounds like you're having
the same, um, you know, having to regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: with soil and with the root cubes for,
I don't pay attention to temperature too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, but I just stress to myself and my
customers that you keep them moist because
[SPEAKER_01]: once they dry out, it's just so hard to
recover from that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what the seedling mats are very
helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they got to be, be careful because
I've placed my cups directly onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: ceiling mat, uh, mats and just fried my
roots, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it becomes too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a temperature monitor on some of
these ceiling mats, uh, so you can get
[SPEAKER_02]: more accurate as far as what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, your ceiling mat, if you have one
without the, uh, the temperature monitor
[SPEAKER_02]: on it, you know, placing towels in between
that can help so you don't fry your roots,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, because it won't root if the
temperature is too hot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I screwed myself in an aeroponic because
it was cold and it was on a metal surface
[SPEAKER_01]: and we insulated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was still too warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, while it would have been too cold
without it, it was too warm with it and we
[SPEAKER_01]: got root sludge and it was not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is definitely important for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally speaking, how long does it
take for a clone to root?
[SPEAKER_01]: Situational?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, depending on cultivar,
the only, that's the only reason why I say
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my only, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when I seen that question,
um, just probably personally, cause right
[SPEAKER_01]: now I'm having an issue with my wifi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, she just does taking her sweet time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you what, whereas I have other,
uh, cultivar genetics that just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're almost like too quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, dang, I needed like two
weeks before you were ready, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think that's pretty typical
seven to seven to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like say seven to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really depends on what a root is to
you, because like certain people will
[SPEAKER_01]: think that what I call like the color
flowering of the root or the stem,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, where it's just about, just about to
shoot out those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll call those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call roots roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that just depends on who you
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because even once I see roots come
out, I wanted to be well-developed,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, before I transplant them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the method also will, will
determine how long it takes to root,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're sticking it directly in the
medium, I don't think I've had roots any
[SPEAKER_02]: sooner than 10 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 14 days is typical for when you
can tell the plant has rooted and now new
[SPEAKER_02]: growth is starting, um, you know,
sticking it directly into the medium now
[SPEAKER_02]: with an aeroponic loaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, can't you get some, some people
get roots in like six days or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Six.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've heard four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, I don't know what kind of,
again, black magic you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, they could just have a really
good environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it, it just can, can, can come
down to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not nothing they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, the, the,
the, the genetic or phenotype they have is
[SPEAKER_01]: just a quick router and a quick cloner and
they have the perfect environment or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe they just are really that
good, but yeah, aeroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I say it's the quickest way of
you can get it dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if it's not dialed in and you're
having fluctuation, and everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be a headache and make you feel
like you don't know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think we covered a lot in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let us know, how can the listeners find
you and, uh, what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future?
