[SPEAKER_01]: Take an avocado, super food, super
nutrient rich to begin with, and you mix
[SPEAKER_01]: in some stuff like say, malted barley
flour, because the worms, they really like
[SPEAKER_01]: the malted barley flour, and then put it
top down onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going to happen is the worms in
your soil are going to come up and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to just start feeding on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to think about it like a fish
tank, where if you have a very small fish
[SPEAKER_01]: tank, any changes in that system are going
to greatly affect how things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bigger the system that you have,
the easier it is to sustain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maintain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big changes may have less of an effect
overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blends tend to use a lot of things like
bone meal, blood meal, and you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about where did those come from
organically?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and welcome to my
[SPEAKER_00]: talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I interview another
YouTuber.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes by Photosyntec.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an organic gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he has plants outdoors as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pick his brain pretty good in this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about just a ton of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about what's in his mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about cover crops, mulch layer,
avocado tech, a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'll get a lot of value out
of it.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome, Matt Photosyntec.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad, Chris, and yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on to my channel and
talking today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you having me on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely like the opportunity to just
stop by and visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's just get right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why don't you tell me a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm up in Canada, Canadian,
ACMPR grower is what I'm called up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licensed legal grower for medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been gardening for easily a dozen
years, but I've only been growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: now since, well, legalization came back in
October of 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise started out growing synthetics
as I think most growers do and evolved
[SPEAKER_01]: into organics as I see a lot of growers
are starting to do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely becoming a more popular way to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I run a YouTube channel
called Photosyntec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about organics a lot, gardening,
and just generally there to help people
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how to grow and do the best cannabis
they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to pick your brain
specifically about the organic side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you got some good knowledge on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what size grill pots do you use when
growing organically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, ideally the biggest that you
possibly can, especially if you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to introduce worms into the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now in my space, I'm using some 15
gallon pots and that's about the smallest
[SPEAKER_01]: that you'd want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistically 30 would be better,
but I will be moving into some 80 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: grassroot fabric pots here over the next
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really going to allow me to
have a much better system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I want to think about it like a
fish tank where if you have a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: fish tank, any changes in that system are
going to greatly affect how things work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bigger the system that you have,
the easier it is to sustain it and
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big changes may have less of an effect
overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, um, I started out in bottle
nutrients as well, and then kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: switched to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been mostly doing the blends,
um, but I did try them out in three gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, five gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, oftentimes it's,
it's kind of a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like the way you put that with the,
with the fish tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, what type of grill pot do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, plastic, do you use plastic at all,
or just the, the fabric pots that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing around with a couple of
different things, trying to find stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that works the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, right now, and again, going back on
the grassroot stuff, uh, something that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've recently tried is the, uh,
transplantinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't know if you're aware it's a
fabric pot, but it actually has Velcro on
[SPEAKER_01]: the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can split the thing open to take
your plants out, but, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'll take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them in just little tiny plastic
jars because I'm not or I should say
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic containers because I'm not
planning on keeping them in there for a
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I know that I'm going to transplant
out, um, I do prefer plastic because,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, any fabric pot is, I'm sure you've
found they are a pain to pull the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, why I like these
transplantinators because they've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: Velcro sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited to use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually at MJ BizCon, um,
last year they didn't have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the year before 2019, I did talk to
the guys at grassroots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that they had
pointed out that was pretty interesting is
[SPEAKER_00]: now instead of just doing straight up
fabric, they're adding in that liner on
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause one thing they had mentioned is
that, you know, when you're running living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil with the regular fabric pots,
it's drying out from all the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says that's really not natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there is still aeration down
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still just fabric down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on the very top, there's,
um, also some air in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got a visitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cheddar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I thought that was pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm actually using the plastic pots
now, but I wouldn't, um, I do actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have a two foot by 10 foot bed for
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does have the liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for my vegetables, which works pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I thought that was, that was
pretty interesting when he had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to touch back on that,
I've even seen and talked to some of my
[SPEAKER_01]: viewers who will take and wrap plastic
wrap around a fabric pot to act just like
[SPEAKER_01]: that liner and tell me that they get great
success with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a good hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good hack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried it myself, but as soon as
I get the opportunity, if I need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but because I'm moving all over the fabric
beds anyway, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so what do you use for a medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been playing around, um,
mostly living soil here for at least about
[SPEAKER_01]: the last six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a mix that I've originally sort of
tried to make myself and, uh, I recently
[SPEAKER_01]: did a video on that calling that sort of
my biggest failing as an organic grower
[SPEAKER_01]: was thinking that I was a soil scientist
and knew how to go about making this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, it's not too
difficult to mix up a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of recipes out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as an organic grower and
most organic cannabis growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I think what turned me on was Mr.
Canucks grow his cocoa coir, his dry
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments, making it look easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, is that a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to that point, um, I, I do mainly a
cocoa base now, and it's based heavily off
[SPEAKER_01]: of the build a soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say heavily, both the only
thing that I'm doing different than their
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe is I'm adding in some biochar,
uh, for many, many beneficial qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have three different mixes on their
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is the 30, 33, 33, 33.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one part, one part, and it's,
um, cocoa coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 33%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa coir, 33% aeration, and then 33%
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now just to point on that,
um, they've got another mix on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I believe it's, uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five parts, compost, two parts,
aeration, one part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five parts, cocoa, two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you'd have to go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's recipe number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember, but the takeaway there
is I'm using the one that's heavy compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and 33, 33, 33, because I have excellent
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality compost, uh, see soil stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I get it up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys can get it down
there, but it's excellent, excellent
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the takeaway there is if you can
get the really good, good, high quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I think booze blend is what I've heard
recommended down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then maybe look at that 33,
33, 33 mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've had wicked results with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super, super pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm going to be filling
my, uh, my beds with when I, when I get
[SPEAKER_01]: those kicked off here in the next couple
of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so the, the last 33% is going to
be aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can use a bunch of different
things for aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for aeration?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've landed on a mix of hydroton clay
pebbles and rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the nice thing about the rice hulls is
they break down over time and help give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a little extra silicon to your medium
and silica, as I'm sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, will help your plants grow bigger,
stronger cellular walls, protecting
[SPEAKER_01]: against pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a very beneficial micronutrient
to have into the mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do you amend into the medium
to begin with on top of that 33,
[SPEAKER_00]: 33, 33?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, following of course, that build a
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's the thing I like about it is
they're the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, it's a really simple,
simple mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your NPK, uh, parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a neem or Karanja.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, just to get into that for a minute,
neem is something that's broken down from
[SPEAKER_01]: the neem tree and Karanja very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can, you can't get Karanja and
you can only get neem or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be used pretty much
interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they look very similar and they have
very similar properties and also very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very good at protecting against pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the other, uh, NPK ingredients that go
in there is kelp meal, uh, high in
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, tons of micronutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, just, well, kelp,
of course, fastest growing plant on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why not use kelp?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one that goes in there
is going to be some crab meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your chitin, you've got,
uh, other beneficial parts to it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's going to be the mineral
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, basalt rock dust, which I'm actually
playing with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, up here, Gaia Green has a rock dust
blend that I'm looking at trying to change
[SPEAKER_01]: in because it's got some glacial rock
dust, some basalt rock dust as well as a
[SPEAKER_01]: few other sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the things I really try
to focus on doing organic growing is as
[SPEAKER_01]: many diverse sources as possible just to
get that mix as, as well, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse, because having a large variety of
inputs really makes sure that the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the last thing, of course,
that I put in there is oyster shell flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, which helps with, uh, your calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, uh, the OSF also does a
little bit of buffering of pH as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to worry about doing
things like pHing my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you also add worms, uh,
to your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which type do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got the, uh, the red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to get the night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difference there is the red
wigglers, they sit up top, they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're doing all that work up in the,
the rhizosphere up in the top part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the night crawlers, they're going to
go down deeper and until that lower part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a good mixture again of both,
that diversity is going to give you the
[SPEAKER_01]: best results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a previous convo, you actually
introduced me to avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, can you explain to the listeners what
that is and how you incorporate that into
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely have to give a shout out to,
uh, to, to blue, uh, at blue of green tank
[SPEAKER_01]: on Instagram at blue underscore of
underscore green tank there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he came up with this, it's based off
the idea of fruit drop theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as a fruit tree grows up or a berry
bush, it's going to grow some fruit and
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually drop it with the idea or the
hope that an animal is going to pick it up
[SPEAKER_01]: or perhaps it's just going to decompose
there in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got this wonderful piece of
fruit that's full of all these nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's decomposing, going back in and
feeding that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, as an organic or that's
what we do, we feed the soil to feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea with avocado tech is to do
just that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take an avocado, super food, super
nutrient rich to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mix in some stuff like say,
malted barley flour, because the worms,
[SPEAKER_01]: they really like the malted barley flour
or some, uh, oyster shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, worms need a little bit of grit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some sand, if you don't have it in your
mix, uh, some OSF is nice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them that little bit of grit to help
digest things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically you just take this,
mix it all up like you would, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a deviled egg, put it back into that
avocado shell and then put it top down
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's going to happen is the worms in
your soil are going to come up and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to just start feeding on this stuff
and returning those nutrients into a
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailable form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plant can uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the best thing about this,
the best thing about this is it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so low maintenance because you only
have to do it three times a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how Blue sells it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you've got a half an avocado
for veg, a half an avocado at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of flower or a week or two
before flower starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another half an avocado,
about halfway through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that you're really
changing there is once you get into flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to add in a little extra
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use mineralized phosphate,
bat guano if you're unfamiliar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm looking around seeing what other
more sustainable sources I can find out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of the challenge too,
is always to see what better practices I
[SPEAKER_01]: as an organic grower can take from
industry and bring into my grow room in a
[SPEAKER_01]: more sustainable fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw our video on it actually after you
mentioned it and that was Blue talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and it showed him flipping over
that avocado shell and there was just
[SPEAKER_00]: loaded with worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I had a buddy stopped by the grow
room today to just pick up a clone and
[SPEAKER_01]: he'd never seen it myself or himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing, you pull up the avocado
and there's just swarming of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it's a testament to how well it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the takeaway there too, is it doesn't
have to necessarily be avocado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that Blue's tried cantaloupes and
some other, you know, smaller dome fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is it's, it's a humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely dark, perfect environment
for worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only takeaway is if you are going to
try avocado tech, and I strongly recommend
[SPEAKER_01]: this, is get some Bokashi grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put a little Bokashi mix in there
because I've seen some avocados start to
[SPEAKER_01]: go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got some Bokashi grains in
there, Bokashi being an anaerobic compost
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganism, it's going to help break
down that, that nutrient internal and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, provided just a safer way to get
things done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to flip back to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You briefly talked about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of water do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use reverse osmosis, distilled,
well, tap water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used a variety actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So up until recently, my main source of
water in the grow room has been just tap
[SPEAKER_01]: water, good old dechlorinated tap water,
except in the summer where I've got rain
[SPEAKER_01]: barrels sitting on the side of my house,
because why pay for water when you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: it for free?
[SPEAKER_01]: But recently I did install an RO watering
system, or I should say RO filter for
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use RO water all the time for my
humidifiers because where I live,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have very heavy water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you, if you see all of a sudden,
say you're starting off growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-humidifier in your space and you're
seeing like a white foamy powder
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere, it's not powdery mildew per
se.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's likely minerals that have come out of
your humidifier and deposited onto the
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I use RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's demineralized water in my
humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since getting an RO water filter
installed in my house, I've actually
[SPEAKER_01]: changed over to that to start watering all
my plants, because the big thing for me is
[SPEAKER_01]: my grow room is actually outside in my
garage, which is, you know, a good 15 feet
[SPEAKER_01]: from the house and I don't have water out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I normally fill up five, five gallon
buckets, bring them out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: let the water dechlorinate, and then I'll
use that to water my plants over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the ability to just fill up a
five gallon container with RO water works
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the, the white powdery
substance coming from the humidifier and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the root cause of that is tap
water with the minerals in it and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two other things that that impacts is the
carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually clogs those carbon filter
socks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had so many people say,
uh, reach out to me, like, I'm getting no
[SPEAKER_00]: suction coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, the root cause was
because they were using tap water in their
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier and it was just clogging that
up like pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had another person reach out to
me and mentioned that he saw a build up on
[SPEAKER_00]: his fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like, it went internal
components actually got into his fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all white substance within his fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did damage on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely whenever you're using
a humidifier, definitely want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: filtered water or ideally reverse osmosis
water or distilled water.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, one other thing to think
about, and this is just me thinking out
[SPEAKER_01]: loud is I'm wondering if you get buildup
on the leaves of the plants and it affects
[SPEAKER_01]: the stomata and their ability to intake
actual moisture and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So curious.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if you're using humidifier,
definitely RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said you don't pH adjust your
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the pH is in my water.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grow, um, I haven't measured it in
a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I shouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I do occasionally measure my tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm where, when I was doing tap water,
just to make sure that things were staying
[SPEAKER_01]: on point, but because I sit around 7.4 to
7.8, I don't worry about pHing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let the, the, pardon me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let the medium do that for me because
the microbiology will take and along with
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients that I put in there,
help buffer that pH to the range that it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've even recently learned
that the plant within an area close to the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots has the ability to affect the pH
around it to also help make that a more
[SPEAKER_01]: hospitable zone for the microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key takeaway there is know what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like don't just think you can't not pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've got a whole video that I talk
about this on my channel too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had one point in my, the,
water coming out of my tap was over eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: 8.0 pH and, uh, dechlorinated it and then
give them my plants and didn't get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, measuring that runoff,
uh, pH, it was high and I was seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies into my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally do pH, my pH adjust my
water to make sure it's within,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if I'm growing in soil between
six and seven pH, um, that's just what's
[SPEAKER_00]: worked best for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it works well for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to, but let me, let me put it
through this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I start to see deficiency or some sort
of toxicity, the first thing I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is check runoff and see if that I've
got something odd going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should be the takeaway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't pH because I don't have to,
but I know that it's an absolute top tool
[SPEAKER_01]: in the arsenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know what your pot size is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we know what your mix is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've amended that mix up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you're, you've got your
plants going.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you give your first feeding and
how do you, and how do you feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right now I've been working on trying
to do a perpetual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get to the point where I would just
ideally be pulling veg plants out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: tent that I have here behind me and
putting those into the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'd be more re-amending the medium
ideally at the point of planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very close to it, but because I've
been changing beds out and, and working
[SPEAKER_01]: through this whole new system,
um, I, I don't have a very consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to it at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that being said, the idea is if
you're doing something like avocado tech,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing one of the avocados
throughout veg in a couple of weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: you're getting into going flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got a cat running around there or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, to that point,
the, the thing is the union tremors,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're doing organic growing,
you're, your nutrients aren't immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to plan it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's the main thing
is if you know, you're going into flower
[SPEAKER_01]: or you're planning to go into flower in
two weeks time, get your, your extra
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, your extra potassium boost in
now, because that's when it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get it ready to be bio available for when
the plant starts to take it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's the thing is organics really
involve a whole lot of planning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it sounds like it's not a lot of work
because well, I don't pH and I only have
[SPEAKER_01]: to add water and that's all I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, but it isn't, there's, there's so
much planning involved to, to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in that grow, to be able to sit
back and just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk a little bit about cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so which cover crops do you use and
when do you plant them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so the best time to do cover crops is
when you're first starting off your living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil mix a week or two before your plant's
going in to give them some time to get
[SPEAKER_01]: built up and start getting some of that
nitrogen into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the way that I've been doing things,
it's just lately, I, because if,
[SPEAKER_01]: if, uh, let me, let me back this up a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people haven't seen my channel,
I recently ran into an issue where my
[SPEAKER_01]: gross seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been trying to recover by bringing
in and doing a whole bunch of,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, well, fast methods to get things
turned around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now I'm just doing cover crop and
then I get the plant in there kind of at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is yeah, cover crop a couple
of weeks ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now cover crop that I use, you can go as
simple as say red clover, white clover,
[SPEAKER_01]: something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to the diversity thing,
I use a five seed mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get from black swallow living soils up
here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's got fenugreek, uh, clover,
uh, a couple of, I can't remember off the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of my head, but it's, again,
it's, it's got multiple things in it to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide a higher level of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just using the white Dutch clover
right now, but, um, yeah, I've seen the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, the blends that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a couple of different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, take a look, trying those out in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually thinking of maybe throwing
some peas in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I get these, uh, grassroots fabric
pots, but just cause they got the chalice
[SPEAKER_01]: going up the side and these are extra
excellent nitrogen fixers and delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: and a multilayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you add one of those to the top of
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for a mulch layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when do you apply that generally just
straw, uh, and right away, as soon as you
[SPEAKER_01]: get that, that plant transplanted,
uh, you want to get the mulch layer down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing cover crop,
don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about putting the mulch over
top, the cover crop, the cover crop will
[SPEAKER_01]: grow up and through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been working on it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A mix of different, uh, mulches where I've
got some cedar wood chips and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go, you can't do cedar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hit me up on my, my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as well as some, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, again, just straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea there is getting some wood in
there because what is going to bring in
[SPEAKER_01]: that fungal component.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, with diversity, not only do you
want good bacterial components in your
[SPEAKER_01]: cell, you want lots of fungal components
because funguses will help break down and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and move things around a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, when we talk about
things like my carriza, the most
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial fungus you can have in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to have a lot of different
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you told us when that first feeding
happens, all those, you know, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: a gray area depends a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, what about the second
feeding like something within flowering to
[SPEAKER_00]: typically people will do, they'll amend
the medium to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then before flipping a flower,
they'll do some sort of top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, with some, um, flower type
nutrients and then like 30 days into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering along those lines, week three,
four or five flowering, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do a, another type of top
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything like that?
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week, week three is when I prefer to hit
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because I'll go and do my,
my initial flower feed a couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I get into week three,
I like to do that feed because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to give that a couple of weeks for
it to become bioavailable and ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that, that was a bit of a
learning thing too, because going from
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics to organics, it was just,
okay, well, I'm going to change up my feed
[SPEAKER_01]: week five, I'm going to use this set of
bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you have to be prepared for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then also bringing in things like
sugars to help increase microbes and well
[SPEAKER_01]: boost the ripeness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's lots of different organic
ripeness boosters out there too,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, so what exactly like for that
second feeding, is there anything in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular that you give to the plant at
that time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, we touched on that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I'll do the PK boost with some
phosphorus and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like kelp for getting your
potassium and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, so you do incorporate sugars
into your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually sugars once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'll mix it up too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use molasses, blackstrap
molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got some coconut nectar
sugar, which I picked up by accident from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Costco thinking it was a different
type of coconut product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually I find that I really liked
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a light sugar that dissolves really
well in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll alternate each week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do one tablespoon of sugar or
molasses into the water, uh, per gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: mix that up and feed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps boost up that microbiology,
because one of the things that I don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: is compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason for that, um, if you're
familiar with the future cannabis project
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier this summer, they had a really
great episode on talking about bro science
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, Linda Chalker Scott.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I got her name right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, fantastic scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: She doesn't work with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: She just works with gardening,
but she came on, she talked a great deal
[SPEAKER_01]: about compost tea and why it's not really
necessary to use compost TV because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get the same level of benefit from it
by just top dressing with compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that I've been doing
a lot of lately is I'll just top dress
[SPEAKER_01]: with the compost, some earthworm casting,
some Kashi in the mix, and then just water
[SPEAKER_01]: in with my molasses water, which is
effectively the same thing as doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: compost tea with the exception of I'm not
letting it brew overnight and letting
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that microbiology bloom in a big pot
of water, but I'm letting it bloom in a
[SPEAKER_01]: big pot of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is all of that compost tea
action is happening, but it's already in
[SPEAKER_01]: the pot in a more concentrated form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will say that I've been getting
amazing results with this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really do compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to do any like nutrient teas,
plant teas, manure teas, anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've never heard of manure tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see how that might be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, I do seeds for teas, uh,
once a week, uh, depending on where I'm in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cycle, vegetative, I'll do bone,
pardon me, corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley and alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in flower, I'll do corn,
barley and mung beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, each one has its own benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a whole video up on my channel
that talks in depth about it, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: short of it is, uh, it's part of the
routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, corn takes several days to sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barley doesn't take quite as long and
alfalfa and mung beans take even less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on Friday night, for example,
I'll take some corn seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them in some water and let those
soak for a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day, dump those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add some barley into another jar,
let those soak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the next, you know, four or five
days, I'm getting these seeds to the point
[SPEAKER_01]: where they've sprouted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I take and cannibalize them by
hitting them with the blender,
[SPEAKER_01]: add those into some water to dilute it and
then water from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, biggest takeaway there is you
want to talk about overnight growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, especially with alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alfalfa has a chemical in it called
trichontinol, which is a growth booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if, if you want to see immediate
growth, um, you know, like steroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: like growth with your plants, just try an
alfalfa sprouted tea just once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the way to mix them is quite simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're generally going a half a cup of
seeds per five gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're using alfalfa,
do a quarter cup cause it's, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll come in really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, just, just blend that up
and, and mix the juice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll strain it through like a nylon bag
too, just so I'm not putting all the seed
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff into the water itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then those seeds that I've grown,
ground up and put into the nylon bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take an old top dress into my pots as
well as a little extra treat for the
[SPEAKER_01]: worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you talked a little bit about,
uh, Gaia green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use those organic blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I'm sure there's people that are
watching here that are brand new to my
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe this is the first video you've ever
seen of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so a little bit, uh, background on me
is I've been growing for almost 11 years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time I've been using those
bottled nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetics, but I've slowly worked my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only weaned my way off the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I started with, uh, organic
blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I started with earth dust by the
green sunshine company and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions are pretty, pretty
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they have a formula for base and they
have a formula for boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base is, um, what you use when you
first amend into and during veg and then
[SPEAKER_00]: use boost for flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's what I would typically do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like two to four tablespoons
per gallon or something like that for the
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the boost, um, had some pretty
good results doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different organic blends
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Dr. Earth down to earth,
Mr. B's trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there is a new one that I tried out
with slow dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, build a soil has their own craft blend
that they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you've used Gaia green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you used any others besides Gaia
green or Gaia green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the stuff for black swallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, we're, I don't know if it's
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up here, but I've got two good sources
and, and that's who I rely on and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've heard down to earth stuff down in
the States is also really good to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's, it's really just looking at
where the amendments coming from,
[SPEAKER_01]: how are they sourcing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of the things about blends,
and this is why I decided to mix it myself
[SPEAKER_01]: is pardon me blends tend to use a lot of
things like bone meal, blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to think about where did
those come from organically?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's waste byproduct from
the, the food industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's good that there's a use for
that, but does that necessarily mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be using that to grow your plants
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it works for you, it works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like just side note,
uh, talk about that blood meal for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you've got a nitrogen deficiency in
your plants, make up a quick tea using
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit of blood meal and water
that into your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like a synthetic nutrient at
that point because you're making it
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailable because it is a dried blood
that's basically turned into a ground
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, those nutrients may have their
place, but, uh, yeah, no, um, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about finding stuff and local to like
the local stuff that you can get is way
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, don't buy and ship nutrients
across the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have to, uh, rice holes,
for example, I need to go and get more
[SPEAKER_01]: rice holes for my girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go to the local brewery
and get them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pounds for 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's the thing about organic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They should be relatively inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a 50 pound bag of oyster shell flour
is going to cost me, I think $75.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to feed my two 80 gallon
beds for the foreseeable future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organics, you know, should be fairly
inexpensive to do in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what other advice do you have for
growers who are maybe switching from,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, synthetics over to the organics
side of things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a really important thing
because I've said this a couple of times,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, throughout our chat here is those
nutrients take some time to become
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that process is made, uh, faster is
increased by inoculating your medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can inoculate your medium through
a bacteria that comes in a powder form,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or by doing a compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I just talked about compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be just that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way that I kickstart my medium,
I just did transplanting last night was
[SPEAKER_01]: just to, again, compost on top,
a little hokashi in the mix, little earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings, and just water in,
you know, and, and that's, that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if, if you understand how inoculation
works in that you need to get something
[SPEAKER_01]: living in that medium to start eating
these nutrients and providing them in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a more ionic form to your plants,
then you're going to be sort of off to the
[SPEAKER_01]: races.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just planning, planning,
planning, planning, thinking about what
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do, but don't try and be a
soil scientist, find a recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: stick to that recipe and then start
experimenting because then I think you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to find a much better level of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing we didn't talk about is
microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use any products, microbial
inoculants or recharge, mammoth pee,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've been thinking about getting into
the recharge just because I hear so many
[SPEAKER_01]: good things about it and I'm a huge fan of
the Dude Grows podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like watching those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, no, I rely mostly on just the
compost and this compost that I get in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sea soil seems to really do the trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then to that point, if I could get
another source of compost, it wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: a bad idea either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using some vermicompost, I've,
I've started up a worm bin a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: months ago, so I've got fresh worm
castings and just adding in as many
[SPEAKER_01]: different sources as, as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Matt, thank you so much for coming
onto my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight and, uh, you know, letting people
know how you do your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of good information
for my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most my audience is beginners kind of
shifting over from the bottled side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things to the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you provide a lot of really good
useful information for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for coming on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Chris, absolutely happy to come and
chat and, you know, stop by my channel if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to come and see a conversation
that Chris and I had about a week ago
[SPEAKER_01]: where we got to learn about Chris and his
grow style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, stop on by and, and say,
hi, I love to have you over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, Chris, thank you so much for
giving me the opportunity to come and
[SPEAKER_01]: speak with your viewers like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link Matt's channel down in the
description section below, along with a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of videos that we kind of talked
about already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the avocado tech and,
uh, there might be something else that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link down in there that goes to your
channel for the viewers to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Matt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too, sir.
Thank you.
Okay.
