[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka MrGrowIt, and I'm back with
[SPEAKER_00]: another Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only about two more weeks left on
the t-shirt campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the screen right now, I'm showing you
the t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to everyone who has purchased the
t-shirt so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want one, I'll leave a link to it
down in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into this week's questions,
a lot of good questions this week,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a quick shout out to our
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: AEC Infinity is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their clip-on oscillating fan is now
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their 6-inch version for
over 6 months now, and I absolutely love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to clip on the side of my grow
tent, and it has 10 different speeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it easy to control air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also have non-oscillating versions
of these clip-on fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fans are currently in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they sell out of the fans,
which I expect them to often, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-order them for the next release.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use discount code MRGROWIT if
you're buying off their website,
[SPEAKER_00]: acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That discount code works for all AEC
Infinity items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or discount code MRGROWIT15 if you're
buying off Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best at-home IPM solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my best at-home IPM solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some controversy behind
neem oil, but I do use neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use yellow stickies as a form of IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, my recipe is I use a lot of
like rosemary and peppermint is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: what I use for essential oils,
and I'll take about 32 ounces of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of either dish soap or Dr.
Bronner soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's usually about a teaspoon of
it that I put in there, and then a few
[SPEAKER_00]: drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like up to five drops of
rosemary or peppermint essential oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake that up, spray it onto the plants,
and that has worked pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotating it around, so doing rosemary one
week, next week, for example, or the week
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, doing a neem one week,
two weeks after that, switching up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: peppermint, and then kind of going back
and rotating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the three main things that I
do as far as sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, you know, yellow stickies
like I talked about, which is a part of
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a preventative measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I clean before I start the grow,
and I like to do a thorough cleaning when
[SPEAKER_00]: I transition to a flower, if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my plants aren't just too crowded in
there, if I'm able to remove the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: from my grow tent, for example,
I'll do a nice thorough cleaning before
[SPEAKER_00]: going into flower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to think of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else that I do for IPM,
really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, those are the main things that I can
think of off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When to harvest seeds after the plant runs
its life and dies or at regular harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: time on trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question, Granny Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope all has been well with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually doing a seed run right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
I did a cross, brisker OG, cross with
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is named Chillout OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually all the way down to,
I'm working on getting an F3 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just harvested a bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The offspring of those plants are F3
generation, so it's inbreeding that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, from all I learned,
and I don't have a ton of knowledge when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to breeding, but from my
understanding, you want to kind of keep
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant healthy all the way up until
harvest, specifically when you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: seed run like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy plant results in healthy seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So general answer for you would be get the
plant all the way up until it's starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of kill itself off, at least in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start to like kill itself off.
[SPEAKER_00]: This might be at harvest time or a little
bit after you would normally harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, it's usually a week or
two after, sometimes even more after your
[SPEAKER_00]: typical harvest that you would do on just
a female plant, for example, where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just harvesting the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the plant starts to decay,
die off, that's when I've been harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it hasn't been any impact on
seeds, beautiful seeds I've gotten off
[SPEAKER_00]: this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that pretty much answers your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: pHing your water in organic living soil,
especially when using tap water,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is 8 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would definitely recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes my water comes out above 7,
7.2, 7.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I have a lot of bicarbonates
in my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of bicarbonates increases the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a high source of pH to
begin, I would definitely recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: lowering it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using tap water, well water,
something that has some sort of minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, a PPM in it, you know, it could be
as low as like 40 PPM or 100 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't drift down as much when you're
using the pH up or pH down solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so phosphoric acid or whatever
you're using for pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using RO, it only takes like a
couple drops to drop it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm doing two or three drops,
less than a milliliter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm using tap water, back when I
used tap water at one point, I had 485
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm using a lot of pH down in order to
adjust it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be careful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you're continuing watering in
your organic living soil at like 7.5 or 8
[SPEAKER_00]: pH or just a higher pH above 7,
generally speaking, it could cause
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your living soil is like if the pH
of your medium is 6.0, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or let's say it's 6.3, if you're watering
in at a significantly higher pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're disrupting the microbial life in
your living soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of them are actually getting
killed off because the pH is being
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I totally recommend that, you know,
for that as one reason to lower the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: pH adjust it before giving it to your
living soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in organics, even when you're
growing organically to help prevent that
[SPEAKER_00]: harm from happening to the microbes down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason why is because nutrients
aren't available for uptake that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is a good example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if it's over 6.5 pH,
plant isn't able to uptake iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what happens is it's a different
form of iron in the medium when the pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: that high and the plant isn't able to
uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to lower it in order to
actually get it into a form that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is able to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that the plant will do is
it'll actually release acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll excrete acids out of its root in
order to lower the pH so it can uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those high pH is you just got to
be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't water in above 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to water in above 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: 7, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can lower it down to the 6s,
I'll definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you advise a grower new to autos
on how to feed them as in how much on the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of life?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually my book, Shameless
Plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Link in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a section here on PPM,
which I will read to you real quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: page 68.
[SPEAKER_00]: So autos, photos, it's going to depend on
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some could be these ranges right here
are just going to be general ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly go higher, lower,
and the plant may be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after sprout, first week in vegetation
stage, 100 to 250 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 500 scale PPM is what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg Weeks 2 and 3, 300 to 400 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg Weeks 4 and beyond, anywhere from 450
to 700 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it could take a little higher,
especially when you've got bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers Week 1 through 4, 750 to 950.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers Week 5 and beyond, 1000 to 1600
PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's usually what I stick by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, some plants are going to
be able to take more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants will still be healthy with
less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just general ranges that you
can stick by.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as autos being different than
photos, as far as feeding, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of controversy behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion on it is that the differences
are going to be minimal depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you smoked the freak show yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually released an update video on
that, the harvest video on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I smoked some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong lime flavor, definitely hint of
gas, some sweetness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't thrilled with the bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish it was more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can say that it's my environment
that's causing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody had mentioned that it's an
outdoor cultivar and it is better for
[SPEAKER_00]: lower temps, specifically in the flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran it at like 81, 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: 82 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, the bud structure,
I think that impacted it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's pretty good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's one cut you wish you had mothered?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to say Queen Anne's Revenge
by Subcool Seeds, formerly TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a beautiful Fino of this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my grow series, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dig back on my channel way back,
I think it was like 2017 or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cringe videos back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the plant ended up being like,
I had like magnesium deficiency like early
[SPEAKER_00]: on in the grow while I was still in veg,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was easy to recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very easy feeder, somewhat of a heavier
feeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it grew, like in flowering,
all the buds were super dense all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes were covered all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even those bottom little buds at the
bottom, they weren't really larv.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hard buds with a large amount of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And towards the end of flowering,
it ended up slowly changing color from top
[SPEAKER_00]: to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a dark purple and it slowly
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each day I'd open up the grow tent and
it would be purple up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next day, a little bit more
lower, lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the whole plant was just
completely covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually did a partial harvest on
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snipped off those top branches and I was
going to lower the light and let that
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom part of the plant ripen some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after I harvested those top branches,
it uncovered some leaves that weren't hit
[SPEAKER_00]: by the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like a beautiful green
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made them look like a lime green color
almost because the purple was so dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to dig back on my videos to see
what I'm talking about, but it just looked
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely beautiful with the mix of
colors there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really remember what the flavor was,
but I do remember a very narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that just really made me chill
out, zonk out, pouch lock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the one that got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one that got away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I wish I kept that as a mother
because there was some really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I assume what you mean is how much
craft blend am I mixing in with the Fox
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Ocean Forest Soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: To begin, I'm not mixing any in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm taking Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil
from the bag, having my plants in there
[SPEAKER_00]: for 30 days and then top dressing at that
30 day mark with the Build Soil Craft
[SPEAKER_00]: Blend, one cup per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I'll add in some worm
castings along with it, help boost up the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbe life.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times do you pot up photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I've done it so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started in solos, went to ones,
went to threes, started in solos,
[SPEAKER_00]: went to ones, went to fives, started in
solos, went to ones, went to sevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been liking starting in ones,
one gallon containers, letting it grow for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30 days or so, shaping it as best as
possible, full blown training,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then transferring it to a seven gallon
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of you know me, I like to keep
my plants smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need this large plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shortly after transplanting,
I'm flipping over to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually has been maintaining just
about, just about to the end of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients that are in that seven
gallon container have lasted the remainder
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite way to go about it,
just because it's a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying to use organics in five
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like by feet times come around,
it's already lacking a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could this be a sign I should maybe use
seven gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, ever since I switched to
organics, I've tried organics in three
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons, I've tried organics in five
gallons, I've gotten the best results off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the seven gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a lot easier being able to have
a seven gallon with all those nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, having the roots be able to spread
out as they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just a lot easier being in that
larger container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might even go up to a 10 gallon
container soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I have four seven gallon
containers that are living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been using them grow after grow
after grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm on my fourth grow with them,
maybe third grow with them, reusing that
[SPEAKER_00]: same soil in seven gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time I just amend with,
well, it varies a little bit, but build a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil craft blend is one example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll put a cup in that seven gallon
container, then I'll plant my seed in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every 30 days, I'm doing another
top dressing of that one cup of craft
[SPEAKER_00]: blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just one example, you know,
earth dust nutrients, or you can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: other nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think you would be happy in a seven
gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are the peppers, melons going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I have a two foot by 10 foot
living soil bed in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two varieties of peppers,
going right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got, let's see, one, two,
three, four, five plants of peppers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then three plants of melons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melons is of Madhuras.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm pronouncing that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's from India and high
temperatures is what it thrives in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really 100 degrees or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where I live, it's 100 degrees just
about every day from June through August.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Madhuras hoping that I can get some
good result off that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The melons started producing male flowers
so far, waiting for the female flowers to
[SPEAKER_00]: come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the peppers haven't started forming
flowers yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not quite there yet, but everything's
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's looking good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just harvested four plants of Chilladoji.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just finished up that breeding run that
you guys saw on my regular gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did a seed run and prepping for
my next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gonna be doing auto flowers next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you guys next time.
Bye.
