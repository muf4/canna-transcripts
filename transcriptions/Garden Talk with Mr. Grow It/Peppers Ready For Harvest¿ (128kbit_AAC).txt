[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back on another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a vegetable garden update for you this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not an expert by any means
when it comes to vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just dabble in them a little
bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have four pepper plants going
right now and some lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd bust out a quick video
and show you what I got going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into the video,
gotta give a shout out to ACInfinity for
[SPEAKER_00]: hooking me up with this gift box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually opened up this gift box on one
of my live streams on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not following me on Twitch,
go to twitch.tv slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on there doing lives, you know,
one to two times a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I have a guest on there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the box there was so many goodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some stickers, candies, some shears,
and a controller 69 developer edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not just hooking up me,
they're hooking up you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually provided me with a discount
code for my viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use code MRGrowIt for a percentage
off of any of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, thank you ACInfinity for
this gift.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we are in my two foot by
four foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by ACInfinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see I got the lettuce there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a couple freaks in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there on the left side of the
grow tent, I have four pepper plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these pepper plants are actually a
variety called bullnose peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks very close to bell peppers,
but they're a smaller version of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's actually start off talking about the
bullnose peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are coming right along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely got some fruit forming so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here I'm shaking them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in order to allow pollen to drop
down and pollinate the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowers will then turn into peppers
once pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here I'm peeling off the
flowers around the pepper that's forming
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in the future I'm going to use a
swab to actually grab pollen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers to pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a couple flowers that actually
dropped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't pollinated doing the shake
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll hopefully that'll help pollinate
more in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has quite a few as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one back here, a little bit bigger of
peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one, two, and then there's a
third one here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourth plant back here, I've got quite a
few peppers on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are bigger as well than the
front two ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the biggest one of them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one I would say is pretty close to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know when you guys determine
when to harvest peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned on my last video that pretty
new to peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first round growing peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely going to continue to grow them
out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I love hearing feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to hear what you do in your garden
that helps you and makes you successful
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I could take some of those best
practices and implement in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, let me know what tips and
techniques you use on when to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are grown in one gallon
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little smaller of a container than
some of you may like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in my last video, there were
several folks that said that I should
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially grow in larger containers,
whether they be three gallon containers or
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon containers, but a little bit
bigger of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have said that it would have gotten a
little bit better of a result.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I see lots of folks growing in
these smaller containers, one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a little bit of space
constraints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I chose to go with one
gallon containers this round.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, maybe next round I'll go with a
bit larger of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have a separate video with an
update on these two freaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video is just going to be on the
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to the head of lettuce that I
have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the container that I had
the cut and come again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had half of the container butter,
crunch lettuce, and then the other half
[SPEAKER_00]: spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spinach didn't do very well at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's because the hotter
temperatures that are on here,
[SPEAKER_00]: they like the cooler temperatures,
you know, low seventies, even into the
[SPEAKER_00]: sixties or below that they can survive in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some actually say the lower the temps
provide a better flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, talking about the lettuce here,
butter, crunch, it's actually about to
[SPEAKER_00]: bolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am going to harvest this,
turn this into a salad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think next time around, I'm going to
grow probably two, maybe four heads of
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce in one seven gallon container in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I'm going to do the cut and
come again method again, just because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't eat that much lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it went to compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good amount of it actually went to
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these plants were grown with
organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used earth dust nutrients by the green
sunshine company this round and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all grown under the ES 180 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also by the green sunshine company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it in the last video, but I'll say
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light is a little bit of an overkill
for vegetables in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light is more for medicinal
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this light actually dimmed down,
I believe all the way to the lowest
[SPEAKER_00]: setting because these vegetables,
they don't need as much light as medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the peppers actually probably
could take a good amount of light,
[SPEAKER_00]: but lettuce doesn't need that much at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outro card here, the video on the
left is the previous episode with these
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables that I spoke about.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
Thanks for watching.
