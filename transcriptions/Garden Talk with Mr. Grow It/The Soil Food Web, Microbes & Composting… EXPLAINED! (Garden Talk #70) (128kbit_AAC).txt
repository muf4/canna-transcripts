[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you learn about the soil food web and
how the system works, it's
[SPEAKER_00]: self-perpetuating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you have the key
ingredients, which is organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of mineral, macro and
micronutrient base to it, the system is
[SPEAKER_00]: self-automated to kind of run on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at a really healthy
system versus just dirt, you really start
[SPEAKER_00]: to notice the difference in biology
between what a healthy system has included
[SPEAKER_00]: in its biology versus dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mostly just find mineral particles and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your system goes too anaerobic,
and you start producing large amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohols, which is a byproduct,
your alcohol and a root system will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually liquefy your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings more diversity into your soil
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having kind of a mixed bag of all the
different kinds of predatory species is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Kaye the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is certified through Dr. Elaine
Ingham's Soil Food Web School and has
[SPEAKER_01]: extensive knowledge in soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to get into a small
handful of topics that relate to soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biology, the soil food web, microbes and
composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Mars Hydro for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mars Hydro has an official partnership
with Samsung and uses their Samsung LM301B
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes in their FC6500 and FC8000 LED grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: These fixtures provide an average 1000
micromoles per meter square per second
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD in a four by four grow space,
which makes it very suitable for
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growers.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Kaye the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to get into a small
handful of topics that relate to soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first thing we're going to go over is
the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually haven't had, I think we had
like one other guest kind of touch upon
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil food web a little bit,
but they didn't really get into many
[SPEAKER_01]: details.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the soil food web is super
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to have you on to
talk in detail about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to get into microbes
really deep into some of the microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: their functions, which is very important
when it comes to living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we have time, we will get into
composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking to people who are into
composting, who have knowledge on it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I am somewhat new of a composter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been doing it for about like
eight or nine months now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I love to have people on and like
pick their brain from my own personal
[SPEAKER_01]: gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, we'll, we'll get into those
things and then and then we'll go from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Kay the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a YouTube channel and a small
Instagram channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow, build and fix things on my YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a big DIY channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am certified through the soil food web,
through their FC courses, as well as their
[SPEAKER_00]: certified lab tech program, which I
basically do biological lab assessments
[SPEAKER_00]: and analysis on different kinds of
microbial populations in certain soil
[SPEAKER_00]: systems and samples I get sent in or to
test on my own personal property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also certified by Green Flower Academy
for their medicinal plant cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also have that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got started really full time gardening
in 2018, moving to the property I
[SPEAKER_00]: currently live at, which we're blessed to
have 10 acres here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, at first I was excited and
then I realized how much work 10 acres is
[SPEAKER_00]: really to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been doing it bits and pieces
at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in 2018, the US farm bill was signed
into law after a 48 year prohibition on
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, it was federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 2019 and 2020, I had a hemp
cultivation license through the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I learned a lot of
growing medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how that process works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of stumbling my first year and
killed some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but I also was able to get plants
through to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was successful at least in that first
year to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, every year I tried to
grow my education as well as my knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: and wisdom for growing, not just medicinal
plants, but several different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: species of plants and trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've checked out your YouTube channel and
I feel like you have one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: underrated channels out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of great information and
definitely anybody who's tuning into this
[SPEAKER_01]: that wants to learn more about,
you know, you have a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of different gardening topics on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to say it's just,
it's just one thing, but I'll definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: have a link to his YouTube channel down in
the description section below,
[SPEAKER_01]: head on over there, check out his videos,
give him a subscription.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're tuning in on one of the
podcast platforms, just search for his
[SPEAKER_01]: name, K the guy and his channel will come
up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think a lot of you will enjoy
his videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives a lot of valuable content there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many different styles of
gardening, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you an indoor grower outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: What medium are you in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing with synthetic nutrients
or organic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, when I first started, I had to
start indoors cause our winners are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I had to start our little baby
plants, um, in an indoor grow area that I
[SPEAKER_00]: built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I had to learn about, you know,
different lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I started with essentially fluorescent
lighting to something really basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I've, I've all the way advanced up
to chill tech, um, for our lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I grow indoor, uh, typically
during the winter months and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I grow outdoor, um, during the
summer months when it's warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's kind of a mixture of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I started off doing a lot of
synthetics and, um, that was for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was more challenging than,
than switching over to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, organics, once you learn about the
soul food web and how the system works,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it's, it's self-perpetuating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as you have the key
ingredients, which is organic matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, some type of mineral macro
micronutrient base to it, the system is
[SPEAKER_00]: self-automated in order to kind of run on
its own, uh, indoors, I use, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: earth boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And grassroots pots, uh, which are really
good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like it because, uh, with an earth
box, I could just fill it with three to
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 mils of water and I can,
I can go take a vacation for five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of hands-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about the,
uh, medium getting too wet because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a bottom fed water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the top gets too wet, um,
then you end up going slightly anaerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: or your environment gets a little too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up with situations like
fungus gnats or those kinds of situations
[SPEAKER_00]: where now you're battling something
because your environment got slightly out
[SPEAKER_00]: of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really do like that bottom fed,
um, uh, earth box systems for indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The automated systems for like the
automated watering systems can be so
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it saves time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with the, uh, the right moisture
content in the medium, which is super
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to really dial in when you're
hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a, uh, automatic watering system
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the blue mat system and I've used
the auto pots in the, in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think AC infinity, not sure if
they've revealed this yet and they might
[SPEAKER_01]: get mad at me for revealing it,
but they actually have an auto watering
[SPEAKER_01]: system in the works or actually it might
actually already be released at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I'm looking forward to trying that
one out as well, but is it going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: top fed or is it a bottom fed system or a
drip system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know bottom fed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's starting from the bottom of wicks
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those kinds of systems because then
your, your, your top surface never really
[SPEAKER_00]: gets over soaked for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only downside is like I've used the
auto pots before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm doing top dressing,
keeping that top layer is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the wicking doesn't really keep that
top layer truly moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, as you know, we need to keep
that top layer moist with the amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the biology can break it down and turn
into usable nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, I love those.
[SPEAKER_01]: The systems, it definitely makes things a
lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us what is the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially the soul food web is a
discovery made by Dr. Elaine over the past
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 to 50 years of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: That discovery is essentially how plants
receive the soluble nutrients through the
[SPEAKER_00]: flow or cycle of organisms around the
roots of the plants through predation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the soul food web school curriculum,
what we learn is essentially the history
[SPEAKER_00]: of, of all this research, decades of
research that Dr. Elaine has done going to
[SPEAKER_00]: different continents and regions around
the world and perceiving what the
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms in the soil are doing and,
and, and what the, the base life forms,
[SPEAKER_00]: which essentially are our bacteria and our
fungi are, are being consumed by these
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what she would notice over the course
of time is that there was certain groups
[SPEAKER_00]: that were always consistent in every soil
medium throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what she created was more or less a
flow chart of understanding the base life
[SPEAKER_00]: forms that need to be present,
which are our prey in the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create enzymes that break down parent
minerals of sand, silts and clay in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil around different regions of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what they do as they're
breaking down those minerals, a predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: species will come along and will consume
those creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then release the excess nutrients into
the solar system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how, uh, nature has done it for
years and years, decades or eons really,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, without the help of human assistance
to perpetuate, uh, productive,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for some of these micro organisms
that you mentioned, bacteria, fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll go over protozoa, nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see them with the naked eye,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micro stands for you need, you need a
microscope for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the different types of
microscopes and which microscopes do you
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, um, a real basic microscope
that we use for the soul food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now we use a shadowing,
peripheral microscope, uh, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one right behind me on my shoulder here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these are fairly, uh, inexpensive,
um, kind of the same ones that you see in
[SPEAKER_00]: high schools or college labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's really nothing super special
to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have essentially illumination in the
bottom, a condenser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, usually you'll have at least three
objectives to a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a four, a 40 and a 400 total
magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the four we typically use,
we'll kind of scan around and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: find nematodes at, uh, uh, essentially
four X.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we'll use the, uh, 40 for,
um, identifying a large larger creatures
[SPEAKER_00]: within our soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll go up to 400 to look at
bacteria, um, which is the base
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement to what we use to measure all
the other creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we're looking at, um,
all the different organisms under our
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope, uh, one particular bacteria
called a coxide, which is essentially just
[SPEAKER_00]: a little round, um, little round kind of
blob is a one micrometer diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use that as a kind of a,
a base measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: To measure everything else in our fields
of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I don't want to get too off topic
here, but one of the things with the
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopes that I know that you can do is
I kind of want to talk about DNA sex
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a quick question in regards to that
is like, I know in order to find out if a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is male or female, you can actually
use a microscope to zoom all the way in
[SPEAKER_01]: and see the chromosomes and then identify
if the plant is male or female.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can that microscope that you have,
can you zoom in that far and see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The current microscope I have goes up to a
thousand power and total magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a way, but I'd have to,
I would have to recognize, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the distinctive, uh, differences in
those chromosomes are in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize between male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I probably could, but, um,
I'd have to set up specifically in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to do that on this microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a real base microscope that
goes, uh, between a four and a hundred X
[SPEAKER_00]: objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, being able to, to use it for
other things, uh, is definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's kind of fun cause you get
the microscope, you start really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at slides and those kinds of things and
you kind of get lost at first because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know exactly what you're
looking at in the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's just really exploration and what
you'll start to notice is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the differences between, for example,
if you're looking at a really healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: system versus just dirt, uh, you really
start to notice the difference in biology
[SPEAKER_00]: between what a healthy system has included
in a biology versus dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mostly just find mineral particles and
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been wanting to get a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, when I did my research, I've seen ones
that were like thousands of dollars and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, uh, do I really want to make
that investment right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I came across your videos and you
posted a link to the microscope that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was surprised to see that it was
only, it was only like, what, $300 at the
[SPEAKER_01]: most or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have to get like the slides
and, and things like that, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at less than 500 bucks for
everything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably around $400 in total,
um, depending on how prices get,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, yeah, you basically just need a,
um, a shadowing microscope that has up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 X magnification for what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then you need your test tubes,
your pipettes for drawing your liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you need your, um, your slides and
then your cover slips, uh, in order to do
[SPEAKER_00]: your viewing of all your different micros,
microscope analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can use it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For lots of different things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely gonna have to pick one of
those up for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at the microscope,
you can look at different particles,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there, there's sand,
there's silt and there's clay and you kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of already touched upon like dirt,
um, maybe get a little bit deeper into
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt versus soil, but explain to us what
those things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, sand, silt and clay, and then
combined together, which is a loam,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is essentially the base or parent
materials to what the earth's crust is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And included in all those, um,
different materials is all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: elements, uh, based on Dr. Lane's research
that are, um, once they're plant soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: are able to be taken up by the plant to
grow any kind of plant in any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: region around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some chemists or agronomists will argue
against this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but depending on how deep your root
system goes, you can have obviously more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more available nutrients, the deeper
your system goes into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're just testing the first,
you know, top six inches or 12 inches of a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil medium, uh, they're going to get a
certain test using a malec three or a
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated pace test of what your chemistry
is in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your plant's root system goes down
four feet, then there's a whole nother set
[SPEAKER_00]: of tests that has to be done to see
exactly what we're trying to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, the differences between sand,
silt and clay, obviously when,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're in, uh, uh, areas that's
closer to the ocean, uh, you may see more,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, sand, uh, again, sand is, um,
easily drained, but, um, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring together aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're looking at the difference
between what you would consider dirt or
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing growing in a sand medium,
um, it's, it's basically all just
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get that, uh, swing where you
get organic material back into sand,
[SPEAKER_00]: it starts to turn into a loam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get the, again, organic material
coupled with the sand in that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: growing medium, then you're, you're
starting to build aggregation because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, uh, microbes that are being
added with the organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people wonder where microbes
essentially come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes are coming from, uh, the organic
material that we're adding or is being
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped into those, um, soil, um,
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't necessarily have to go
look for them really that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to go find systems that are
thriving within your area to bring that
[SPEAKER_00]: into a devoid, uh, um, devoid of
organisms, um, environment in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of replenish all that life to get the
system turned on again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to see this stuff through the
microscope, we're not going to get real
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed into how to use a microscope in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although on your channel, you have a video
that you go deep into how to use a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope, what to look for, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't take that away from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody wants to get deeper into that,
definitely check out his channel cause he
[SPEAKER_01]: has very detailed videos on all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some of the microorganisms
at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about we start with bacteria?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us all about bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, bacteria is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bacteria is the, one of the base life
forms within our soil structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they are the prey to all, pretty much
all the predators within the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there are, um, different kinds of
bacteria depending on your oxygen levels
[SPEAKER_00]: within your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the two main aerobic ones are going to
be cocci and bacilli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocci are that round, um, uh, almost like
a little blob, but they look like a dot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we're measuring them,
it's almost like the tip of a pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacilli is essentially a, a pill shaped
bacteria and it kind of looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's usually, um, two to three times
larger than cocci.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but these are the aerobic creatures
that we want to see in our soil mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are our food for all the predatory
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are also the base organisms that are
going to use their enzymes to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: all the sand, silks and clay into plant
available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have three levels of oxygen that we
measure when it comes to the kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that we want to see in the ones
that we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the three levels are aerobic,
which is anything above six parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, whenever we know that we have
an aerobic system, we'll see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocci and a lot of bacilli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whenever we go into lower oxygen
levels, what they call facultative,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, that is between four to six parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is where, uh, unfortunately you
start to see disease causers or
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic, uh, bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this, this is where, um, you're going
to see Spirochetes, Spirulum, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli is in this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as well as some other kinds of nasty
things that'll make you sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, below that is, uh, anaerobic,
which is below four, four parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're getting, uh, that
anaerobic where you have that limited
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of oxygen, um, in certain
conditions, you are going to start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: a really, really bad organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, typically like Vibrio's, which are a
kidney bean shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they have a little tail on the
end of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are, for example, when I was
doing my final exam for, um, my microscopy
[SPEAKER_00]: test, um, my examiner was a former lab
tech that was testing infectious disease
[SPEAKER_00]: and blood samples and those kinds of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said in the presence of Vibrio's,
um, you'll see situations like cholera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so definitely really, uh, an unsavory,
uh, organisms that you don't want to come
[SPEAKER_00]: in contact with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do, obviously you want to clean
everything as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any way that we can measure what
the oxygen level is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned those couple different
methods or a couple of different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any way like the home gardener
can see that or did they just look at a
[SPEAKER_01]: sample under a microscope and see the
different types of bacteria and then can
[SPEAKER_01]: just assume the levels at that point?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if, if you're really not versed on
using a, um, a microscope, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a couple of things that you can do
to, um, understand when a system is going
[SPEAKER_00]: septic, where those things are starting to
proliferate, um, smell, if you're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: any kind of septic smell, um, that is a,
an indication that things are going south.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you detect something like that,
you're probably oversaturated with water
[SPEAKER_00]: and your oxygen levels are dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to re oxygenate those kinds of
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get air in there as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you want to stop the flow of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into those areas so that you're,
uh, slowing or drying off the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of moisture in there and
allowing oxygen to kind of reintroduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause though, even if they start to
proliferate in those situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you can kind of steer it back in the
other direction by just adding in oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: back in immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So letting things dry out, moving things
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting so much,
uh, moisture in one specific area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but typically smell, um, like for
example, if you're, uh, composting,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, meats and you have that rotten,
uh, putrid smell, that's putrescent that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually being formed on, uh, meats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and essentially putrescent is a
by-product of rotting flesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, there's all these different
chemicals that have different smells based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what is decomposing, uh, at that time
and what's, um, decomposing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is usually some, um, can be some
nasty creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when you come into, uh,
anaerobic conditions, particularly like in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root zone, the roots really kind of
destroy themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever seen a picture
of a root that has just been underwater
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's been anaerobic conditions
around the root, but they'll actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you cut open a root, you'll see like
the cells are just all like destroyed and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is basically just trying to,
uh, get oxygen, suck up oxygen through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it destroys itself and,
and there's the whole, the massive hole in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root, uh, versus where there should be
individual cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really does some damage on the root
zone as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if your system goes too anaerobic and
you start producing, um, large amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohols, which is a by-product,
um, your alcohol and a root system will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually liquefy your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to make sure that you're not
getting too anaerobic because that
[SPEAKER_00]: by-product is actually, uh, the opposite
of what you want in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in rhizosphere for your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other point I wanted to make on the
three different levels of oxygen is that
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're getting into the different
kinds of bacteria, aerobic bacteria will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually produce alkalines, um,
and glue structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have aerobic bacteria in your
soil system or your compost, whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to propagate, it's actually
going to increase pH, um, and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: create glues to help create aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those aggregates are what essentially
form the colonies of where all your,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, microbes are going to hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also creates a water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is also an area where you're going
to get a lot of, uh, organisms that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be breaking down things closer to
your root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it also helps with drought resistance
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever water goes through a certain
system and there's really aerobic,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, bacteria through that system,
the water will essentially get held within
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that portion where a lot of aerobic
bacteria are being held and propagating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a lot of benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, according to pH, aerobic
bacteria will bring the pH slightly up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaerobic bacteria will produce acidic
conditions or pH down, um, typically below
[SPEAKER_00]: 4.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're starting to get anaerobic,
your pH is starting to drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously that's going to affect your
plant's ability to take up certain
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only is anaerobic bad for the root
system, but now your plant can can't take
[SPEAKER_00]: up certain things because of the fact that
it's too wet, um, or anaerobic or low in
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when it comes to fungi, uh,
aerobic fungi will produce acidic
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions, but with a fairly neutral
variance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aerobic fungi will produce,
uh, pH levels between 5.5 and seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have, uh, bacteria that's
bringing your pH up, your, your balance of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi will actually bring your pH back
down and help keep it more neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in, in essence, aerobic fungi and
aerobic bacteria are balancing each other
[SPEAKER_00]: out to keep, uh, kind of the perfect pH
for, uh, most of the plants that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then lastly, uh, anaerobic fungi,
um, or Oh my seats, as we like to call
[SPEAKER_00]: them, uh, they're going to produce highly
acidic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, pushing the pH below typically
a 5.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we've talked about on this podcast
before how different things adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of new growers that are
listening in and they, they monitor the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: of their medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we know it needs to be in a certain
range for proper nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of panic that happens
because people are doing a runoff test or
[SPEAKER_01]: a slurry test and they're seeing that
their pH is out of range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they wonder what is doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they own a lot of people just think
that it's the water that they're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: in is the only thing impacting the pH,
which is incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different things that
impact the pH and you just mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned one of the things there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely glad you brought that up
because I wasn't even aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already touched upon it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us more about fungi?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, fungi, fungi, fungi, a lot of
people say it different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just repeat what Dr. Elaine says,
but, um, they are essentially the carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: gatherers to our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're talking about just making a
healthy system worldwide, you want more
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi because they are essentially
gathering more carbon than bacteria do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their structures are long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, uh, they're huge fields,
just, uh, all an interconnected fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: system, and they have a much wider carbon
to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they essentially are gathering up lots
of different types of more complex foods
[SPEAKER_00]: within our system, uh, as opposed to
bacteria, which have a much narrower
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, there are essentially two
types that we really, um, are searching
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when it comes to fungi in our system,
we want mycorrhizal or sacrophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, mycorrhizal obviously pairs with the
root system of other plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrophilic essentially grows on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing about fungi that really,
um, will help you grow almost any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is that there is a successional
series of the ratio between fungal biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: and bacterial biomass that will dictate
what kind of plant will naturally or grow
[SPEAKER_00]: really well in that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you are fairly devoid of fungi in
a system, mainly, you know, bacteria is
[SPEAKER_00]: present.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a lot of, um,
weeds growing in that system or early
[SPEAKER_00]: successional plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a lot of like, uh,
for example, actinobacteria, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: long chain bacteria, it's technically
facultative, but, uh, it's a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria that you want to see under your
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to grow early successional
plants like broccoli, coal, or kale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you plan on doing something like
that in a garden system, you want some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that early successional bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of that facultative bacteria
will also help those plants as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to further on later in
succession, when you're going from the
[SPEAKER_00]: different, uh, so we have different,
uh, um, successional plants, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: weeds and then you have early successional
grasses, you have mid to late successional
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses like meadows, and then you have
row crops, which is where you get into
[SPEAKER_00]: your corn, your wheat, the things that we
do for production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from that point, you're getting
into, uh, shrubs and smaller trees and
[SPEAKER_00]: then all the way to, uh, full tree
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the very end is old growth,
uh, forest where you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, excuse me, fungal to bacteria
ratios of at least three to one or higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in those systems, typically the
biomass of, of bacteria and fungi is much,
[SPEAKER_00]: much higher than what you see in early
successional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot more of the bacteria and fungi,
and then a higher ratio of fungi in those
[SPEAKER_00]: older systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of great information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on a roll with, uh, with this good
info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting right into protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so protozoa are a species of organisms
that we really want to see in our system,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly because protozoa consume the most
amount of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically 10,000 bacteria per day that a
protozoan will consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're one of the highest consumers of
bacteria, which again is going to release
[SPEAKER_00]: most of those nutrients, the excess
nutrients into our soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're extremely important when it
comes to our calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the three main ones that we're looking
for the three main groups of, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: protozoa we're looking for are number one,
flagellates, which they are, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're almost kind of hard to see because
they, they move around constantly and they
[SPEAKER_00]: bumble around from spot to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really have any kind of
specific movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a little pinball machine in
the shape of like a, almost looks like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little mouse sometimes because it's kind
of, it has that like oval shape and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little tail to usually on the front of the
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're looking around for their
favorite bacteria to jump on an aggregate
[SPEAKER_00]: and just start consuming all those kinds
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we love seeing flagellates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fairly small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually five to 15 micrometers in
diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, um, fun to watch fun to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do count those when we're doing our
assessments, amoeba, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, essentially three species of amoeba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's one, which is our sellers,
which look like a big, uh, brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, round donut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, really, um, they're fairly large.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you see them, they just look like
this round blob, uh, under your
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, again, they're, they're,
they're quite large when you see them,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually three to four times the size of a,
of a flagellate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they have, uh, essentially an
outer circle and then an inner circle and
[SPEAKER_00]: the inner circle is actually their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just kind of like, uh,
they, they float around in the system,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a basket, a basking shark,
just with their mouth open, just waiting
[SPEAKER_00]: for things to just float in there as they
consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, test and, and our sellers are a type
of test data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the other kind of, of amoeba,
which is specifically a test data amoeba.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they have, uh, they're about half
the size, maybe a third of the size of an
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcella.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an egg shape to their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have a test on the,
on the end, which looks like a flat part,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is where their mouth parts are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they'll typically have these little
tentacles, uh, from their mouth pieces
[SPEAKER_00]: that they'll reach out and kind of swim
around and they'll, they'll grab bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: and bring it into their mouth parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and these are the ones that we,
we like to see cause they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't move around that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our sellers or test date amoebas,
they just kind of sit there for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really watch them for like,
like 20 minutes, sometimes I'm sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there watching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you'll see them slowly reach out a
tentacle and just start bringing all this
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria into their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the last one, uh, which is a
pseudopods or naked amoebas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, these have no particular structure at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to see them or find them because
they're just a blob and, um, they ooze
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their body structures will change in
different shapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one part will go over here and grab
some bacteria and then it'll, it'll,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll go in another direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another, uh, uh, round looking appendage
will come out from another direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really cool to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're about the size of a test date
amoeba a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, that's another one that we
count when we're counting, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amoeba, uh, in our calculations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so those are the three main aerobic
ones that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the last one, the last protozoan that
we actually count, which lets us know if
[SPEAKER_00]: our system's going in the wrong direction
are ciliates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, ciliates are very easy to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're usually the most fun to watch
because they have their, they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, little speedy gazelles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they go from spot to spot and really
linear fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving so fast under your
microscope, um, that you're just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're trying to, to just catch up
with them and watch what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fun to watch, but, uh,
too many under your microscope slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing one, two, that's
typically fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're seeing five, six,
seven under a field of view in a drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, your system's starting to go
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the creature, the protozoan
creature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we look to make sure that we're not
going, um, anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was watching your microscope videos on
your channel and exactly what you were
[SPEAKER_01]: explaining is what I saw in the videos,
especially the blob you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's pretty crazy to see,
like there's no actual like shape of like
[SPEAKER_01]: the shape of the body just changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a blob.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's like you said, difficult to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was like super interesting
once I saw that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one thing I noticed is that protozoa
in particular, when we get into microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants, and I do have a question for
you later on on microbial inoculants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not many microbial inoculants on the
market actually have protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any reason why that would be the
case?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's probably because a lot of people
actually are struggle to find protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're one of the most important
creatures when it comes to our solar
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, but finding them and getting to
them to reproduce and propagate in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled system is actually kind of
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once you have them, you want to make
sure that they're alive and replicating,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, through binary vision, uh,
which is essentially them splitting into
[SPEAKER_00]: another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, they reproduce asexually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, as soon as they have enough,
uh, food and they're in that system,
[SPEAKER_00]: they just start to reproduce and split
into multiple other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, why they're not in certain
inoculants, it's hard to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I don't, maybe there's a
transportation issue or them going into
[SPEAKER_00]: dormancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I personally haven't done a whole
lot of reviews on people's, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial inoculations, uh, or products.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people want to send them to me,
uh, I'd be happy to review them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously it goes under pretty strict
protocols when we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if anybody's game, sure send them
to me and, uh, and I'll, I'll do as many
[SPEAKER_00]: assessments as I can and try to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's the majority of what we
try to do as, um, as lab techs and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually consultants is, uh,
we actually do, uh, not just working with
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers, uh, and agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we work a lot with, uh, compost and
compost producers, which are essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, kind of, you know, the inoculation,
um, products that a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that some of these living soil
systems might be lacking in protozoa
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a little theory here because
they're inoculating with bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but the other protozoa, like we just
talked about, it's somewhat rare in these
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might, it might be rare in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be thrown off a balance of the
soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that brings us into our next
microorganism, which is nematodes or
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes, tomatoes, tomatoes,
right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nematodes, uh, are another important
creature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, again, when you're talking about all
these different predatory species,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the more the merrier, um,
it brings more diversity into your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, which again is going to create
just another, um, layer of creatures that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to provide certain nutrition for
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be some other ones that do waste
certain nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a kind of a mixed bag of all the
different kinds of predatory species is
[SPEAKER_00]: really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nematodes, we typically will,
uh, do that in the first part of our
[SPEAKER_00]: assessment, um, to see how many that we
have and what kinds that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause there's essentially five,
uh, we have bacterial, which, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: we identify all of these creatures by
their digestive and mouth parts at 400
[SPEAKER_00]: magnification.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, bacteria typically will have a,
a cylindrical mouth with, uh, like a dual
[SPEAKER_00]: pumping system to pump bacteria in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's fungal feeders, which
essentially they have, um, a spear that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that spear is obviously used to,
uh, go into the, uh, fungal bodies and
[SPEAKER_00]: then extract the nutrients from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, fungal feeders, um, typically we'll
have a kind of some kind of pumping
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, a single pumping structure in
their digestive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's also root feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which are the ones we don't want in our
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we recognize those by, uh,
a similar spear that they have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, the, there's an appendage at the
bottom of the spear that looks a lot like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, male medicinal plant parts at the,
at the, at the base of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, um, and so those are the ones that we
don't want in our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or we, if we do see those in the
system, we want to make sure that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory species that are going to
consume those, uh, balance out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, their damage that they may do to any
root systems near our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the last ones are omnivores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They essentially will eat anything that
fits into their mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, predatory species are the largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do things, um, we have a couple
of procedures in the soil food web where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do either protozoan infusions or
nematode infusions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use a specific way of using,
uh, nematodes in a soil solution or a
[SPEAKER_00]: water solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually suspend it and predatory
species are the biggest and they're also
[SPEAKER_00]: the heaviest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sink to the bottom, the fastest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a way that we can kind of
select for predatory species, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively, and then inject that into our
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see the presence of root feeders,
it's pretty much endless when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just so many different
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, here, we're just kind of
scratching the surface a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when we talk to scientists,
we don't know all the microbes out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some that we haven't even
identified yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, it's really a field where you can
just continue to learn and continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn and continue to learn for the rest
of your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's one thing that really
makes it exciting and fascinating to me at
[SPEAKER_01]: least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's definitely an area where I
plan to spend some time in researching and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting deeper and learning more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I might actually take Dr. Elaine's
course on that one, because it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of great information that
she shares with her students there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's one type of composting
in particular that you wanted to get
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermophilic composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what is
thermophilic composting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thermophilic composting is the main
composting method we use for one of our
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest tools, which is compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, our two big tools that we use for,
um, replenishing systems is compost and a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use compost to make sure we're
getting, uh, what we call biocomplete
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, which is the compost that has all
the creatures that we want, the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fungi, the nematodes, the protozoa,
and everything in there to perpetuate more
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we use our microscope to measure
if that's going in the right direction and
[SPEAKER_00]: more are being created, uh, within our
soil systems, or are they dropping off for
[SPEAKER_00]: some reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is something else happening when it comes
to thermophilic compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the reason why we're doing
thermophilic compost is because what we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do with that compost is heat it in
a specific manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is essentially a schedule to
this that we're trying to abide by,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're trying to get above 131 degrees
Fahrenheit for at least a three day
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in that process, we are, uh,
essentially killing pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so pests that may be in our,
our compost that may have got introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow through some organic matter,
and then also weed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you're bringing compost and
mixing it all together, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get, you know, some kinds of weed seeds in
there or grass seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or something else you really don't want in
that thermophilic process, essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, having, uh, three days of cooking time
will kill the undesirables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, while also being able to maintain
certain oxygen levels, which we're usually
[SPEAKER_00]: shooting for a 50% moisture ratio,
um, is enough oxygen so that the good guys
[SPEAKER_00]: start reproducing and we start building a
lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the pathogenic or bad guys
are starting to die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in some cases they'll go dormant,
um, but essentially, um, their numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: are, are getting, uh, cut further and
further down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're essentially selecting for the
best microbes by using this schedule of
[SPEAKER_00]: getting it hot, uh, three days between
turning at at least 131 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, uh, below 170 degrees
Fahrenheit, um, with a specific schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: to each turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we turn the pile,
we turn the pile in a specific manner that
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially we, we, we segregated into
three sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the top, the middle,
and then the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we've reached that three day
131, at least a Fahrenheit temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we take the top off the pile and we
use kind of a wire cage to keep it a very
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the top off and we set it aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take the middle and the middle becomes
a new bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, the top becomes the new
middle, and then the bottom becomes the
[SPEAKER_00]: new top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that process three times and then
everything, every third has, has mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: equally in each area of the, of the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's how we know that our compost
is homogenous, at least at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people that are shooting for USDA
certified, uh, we'll have to do two more
[SPEAKER_00]: turns and have a total of five turns to
have USDA certified compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then thermophilic compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this something that can be done in like
a bin in the garage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm doing vermicompost right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a small bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my garage and I'm able to add things in
and there's worms in there and so on and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermophilic composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can that be done inside in a bin or is
this should certainly be done outside in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Lane shows us, uh, typically in a barn
on like a concrete floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they'll typically do is, is have some
kind of tarp to catch all the catchings of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff that'll fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she'll have a pallet on top of
that and then wire mesh surrounding the
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you could certainly do it in a
space inside of a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to make, you want to make
sure that your moisture content is 50% and
[SPEAKER_00]: not too high or too low below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you can fill moisture and,
uh, we call, we do what's called a field
[SPEAKER_00]: test and, um, you grab your compost or
your ingredients to compost when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: first starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it feels wet, but it doesn't stick
together, you're about 30%, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it feels wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you squeeze it and it clumps together,
but you don't get any drops out of your
[SPEAKER_00]: hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're about 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you squeeze it and you get maybe
one drop, uh, pulled up within your hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you're looking at 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously from that point, you get a
couple of drops out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're 60, you get multiple drops,
70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're getting lots of water
coming out, then you're getting closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to have that pile be aerobic
using the wire and then having a pallet on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath is what you want the pile to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want air to be able to travel in and
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a dry climate, like I am,
I actually wrap it in plastic to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I actually have an issue with losing
moisture in my area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a real tropical or humid
environment, uh, you'd probably not cover
[SPEAKER_00]: it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd probably just leave it out in the
open with just with something to catch,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, everything falling underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'd probably want to make sure that,
um, you're getting more air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not less air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I would need to in our desert
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you put in the pile to
begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do you start this pile?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what can you put into the pile as
you go along and what should you not put
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pile?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have all your ingredients,
you actually want to build a pile that's
[SPEAKER_00]: approximately three feet high by three
feet tall is kind of the base to what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we do that is cause
that's kind of the minimum size that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want in order to generate the kind of
temperatures that we're looking to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, um, if you're doing inside the
house, you just want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: your temperature monitoring your
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a pile can get over 180 degrees,
depending on how much nitrogen you add to
[SPEAKER_00]: the, to the pile itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you build a pile, you don't want
to continue adding things to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's different, uh, composting like
static composting where you do add things
[SPEAKER_00]: over time, but with thermophilic
composting, it's kind of, um, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: making, uh, you know, bread or a recipe of
baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you don't continually add stuff to
the, the batter after you've started the
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the three components you want to
add to your compost pile is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon, a nitrogen source, and a high
nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the more carbon diversity you can get
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually going to be starting some,
um, of my consultant training soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're compiling all the different
ingredients I need for my compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm using, um, wood chips as a
large portion of what would be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm also adding in paper shreddings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recycled paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm also adding in recycled
cardboard, which is a little thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm only adding, I would consider it
six parts or six wheelbarrows is how I use
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six wheelbarrows equals equals my 60%
of the pile that I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's, it's a pretty good ratio
of volume in order to get the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pile you need for the carbon side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so you want the three different
foods in there because fungi, you'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: more diversity if you have different kinds
of foods that are, uh, homogeneous within
[SPEAKER_00]: that carbon source.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second ingredient you're going to want
to have is your green material or your
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this could be, uh, any kind of silage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be, it could be, you know,
cut grass, grass clippings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it could be trimmings off your plants
or trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, weeds, if you're pulling weeds and you
have all this, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bag of weeds, instead of throwing it
away to go to the landfill, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually use that as your nitrogen
component to your, your compost system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the last one that we use is a high
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so the carbon is the fungal
resource or fungal foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen essentially is bacteria food,
but the nitrogen or the green material
[SPEAKER_00]: actually helps keep our temperatures,
um, uh, up where they need to be for an
[SPEAKER_00]: extended period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like the, um, it's kind of
like the fuel that keeps the fire going
[SPEAKER_00]: for a specific period.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nitrogen is kind of like the lighter
fluid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets everything started quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's typically, uh, we use it either
using manure, or if you're wanting to do
[SPEAKER_00]: like a vegan pile, um, you can use,
uh, alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, typically, um, you want to use
something that's fairly fresh alfalfa in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to put into the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also alfalfa, depending on,
um, if you have nitrifying bacteria or
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizobacteria within the root system of
that alfalfa, that's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: high, uh, nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get those things equally
mixed all together in the pile with that
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% moisture, uh, and, and essentially,
uh, evenly mixed throughout the pile in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to make sure that everything cooks,
um, the same throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what tools do you need for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you mentioned monitoring the
temperature or using a temperature gun for
[SPEAKER_01]: this or using one of those temperature,
like that have the probes like use for
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking, for example, have one of those,
do you stick that into the pile?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also for you mentioned turning
the pile, is that just like your
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional pitchfork or what tools are
needed for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, um, you'll want some type of,
uh, uh, cage wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can use really any kind of cage
wire that will get you that three by three
[SPEAKER_00]: cylinder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we usually put it on a recycled
palette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then again, a tarp underneath,
uh, when we return the pile, we definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: use pitchforks because it makes it much
easier when things are stuck together to
[SPEAKER_00]: turn and put parts of the pile here and
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I use, uh, some Rio temp, uh,
compost thermometers, and you want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you get one that's long enough to
reach the center of the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, when we're monitoring
temperatures, uh, what we typically do was
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll measure to the center of the pile,
uh, using our, our compost thermometer and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just kind of push it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold our finger there so that we make sure
that we get the tip, which is where the
[SPEAKER_00]: probe is, uh, in the center of the pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at what point is the compost
ready to be used in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you're going to do that turning
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, if you're, if you're separating
it into thirds, you want three turns and
[SPEAKER_00]: then everything's mixed evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hitting that 131 degree
temperature throughout a three day period
[SPEAKER_00]: between turns, um, then, uh, which
obviously that amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between turns, uh, uh, speeds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your pile gets up to 145 or 155,
uh, your, your timeline of three days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, gets down to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're 165 degrees by the
first day, after the first day of
[SPEAKER_00]: assembling the pile, you got 24 hours,
you can turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, and after you turn it three
times, sometimes it'll take up to five
[SPEAKER_00]: turns, depending on how much nitrogen you
have in the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it starts to cool and it,
it drops below, uh, that hundred and 31
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees and starts to fall into that 80
degree temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, at that point, your compost is pretty
much ready to, to use at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you could always test it out to make
sure you're not getting any specific
[SPEAKER_00]: hotspots within the pile, or you can kind
of mix it a little bit, a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once you essentially have finished
cooking and turning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but that, at that point I've used,
I've used my compost with a little bit of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, either dirt from outside or
some bagged, uh, soil that we may have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lying around and I've thrown seeds
directly into that and they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they actually grow really well and
they all, they have already all those
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're starting to germinate that
are actually going to help them continue,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the rest of their production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pretty relatively quick process
turnaround time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you, since you have a microscope,
are you actually taking a sample of that
[SPEAKER_01]: and looking under the microscope before
you added into your plants, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, top dressing or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main reason why I'm doing that is
because I'm trying to make sure that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, even, even I will make a mistake and,
and have a situation where part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost maybe went anaerobic or I put it
into storage and it didn't quite,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, maybe the top is aerobic, but the
bottom's anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, I'll typically do a periodic
check, um, using my, um, test tubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you can watch the videos to know how
to do a sample and, uh, kind of look in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just make sure the organisms
that I'm seeing are, um, all aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not seeing a whole bunch of ciliates
or a pathogenic, uh, bacteria or Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: my seats, uh, which are the fungi that are
typically, when you look at them under the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope, uh, the difference between an
aerobic and an anaerobic fungi aerobic or
[SPEAKER_00]: usually have some type of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their structures are uniform in diameter
and they typically have what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: septation.
[SPEAKER_00]: What looks like these little like cross
walls as you're looking at the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That are kind of separating it into like
these almost looks like, uh, like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically measured and they're like all
one inch apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So uniform septation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are aerobic creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, typically the ends of where their tip
cell is, is usually flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's very, uh, uniform looking
creature that ends up being a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: organism.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get into Oh, my seats,
the bad stuff, they look like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, almost like a, like a cactus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, under the microscope, they're wispy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have like a lot of structures that
are going all different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their structures are lumpy and bumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked kind of like bubbly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have, uh, usually color.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually colorless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, their, uh, diameters are usually on
the smaller side and it's nothing's
[SPEAKER_00]: uniform about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's basically, it looks like a,
like a fungal strain, but it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as structured as an aerobic fungi
would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get my hands on a microscope
ASAP because I've just, uh, it makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: wonder like how many bad bacteria I have
in my system, you know, and you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you have a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely something I'm going
to have to pick up in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to circle back to microbial
inoculants for a minute here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many people now using
microbial inoculants and like we mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, it's a lot of bacteria and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have nematodes in them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people are overusing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're, they're applying it way
more than they should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine that there's an imbalance in the
soil food web that could potentially be
[SPEAKER_01]: causing some sort of damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to open up this question to you
and just kind of a big broad question here
[SPEAKER_01]: is what advice do you have for someone
who's using microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not investing into a microscope
and you're just adding things into a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system, um, it is guesswork, but you can
still experiment on the amounts that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you're giving to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen is if you don't have
enough organic material within your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system, those inoculants that you're
adding, they won't have enough food to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll basically just die.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decay process could lead to something
that's anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, without a microscope,
it's, it's, it's more or less trial and
[SPEAKER_00]: error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is kind of a longer process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I would do is if you're using
microbial inoculants without a microscope,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, record how much you're using and the
effect that it has on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can either increase or decrease
depending on how the plant reacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in some cases, some plants will react
better than others, even if it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: species of plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, it's not always an exact science if
you don't have all the data that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to quantify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's one of those things that I
would, I would create a log book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see what, uh, your plants are
doing, how they react, how certain plants
[SPEAKER_00]: react.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause some different cultivars may
want more than others or react different
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you can get your hands on a
microscope and you can use that same data
[SPEAKER_00]: set and data logs with a microscope,
even if you can just use some of my videos
[SPEAKER_00]: and just recognize what you're looking at
and being able to say like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: I see more activity now than I did,
um, a week ago, or two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so the, the microbes are starting to,
um, self sustain in this system and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just another tool in your tool belt
to be able to measure the success of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, even if you're just a novice at using,
um, the microscope, everybody can take
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and kind of track where they're
going from that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's some really good advice,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You revealed so much good information in
this podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can go on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talk more and more and more,
but we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us how can the listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find me on YouTube,
uh, at K space, the guy, one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm also on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm trying to do more, but a K
underscore the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm currently working on the final
three stages of my consultancy program for
[SPEAKER_00]: the soul food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I'm going to be doing more
composting videos, extract videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: T videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to get my certification,
I have to take a, a part of land that's
[SPEAKER_00]: devoid of, of, uh, essentially activity,
uh, biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to turn it into one that's,
um, full of life and full of different
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that process is actually,
um, it's, it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually takes months at a time
sometimes in order to do so people can
[SPEAKER_00]: more or less get to follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: With, uh, what I'm doing, uh, on all the
different inoculations and building
[SPEAKER_00]: compost and how to bring life back into
soil systems.
