[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different chemical
constituents that plants construct to
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate their environment in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be the biological populations,
whether it be pH in the rhizosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things are all part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwatering can look like so many
different things and what's happening is
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creating an environment in where
bacteria that isn't conducive to the
[SPEAKER_00]: health of your plants is able to colonize
and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the bacillus species they have
the ability to encapsulate their DNA into
[SPEAKER_00]: an endospore and those endospores they
create like a wax coating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many products out there that
are so overpriced or have such small
[SPEAKER_00]: colony forming units that they're gonna be
unaffected.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 16.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the owner of Bokashi Earthworks
which is a biological fertilizer company
[SPEAKER_01]: that specializes in microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been cultivating for 20 years and
he currently owns a 40 acre farm in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great episode that I have for you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more of an advanced discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we talk all about microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that we talk about in
this episode are ideal soil temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: for microbe activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about large swings that can happen
in the micro population.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rate of microbe reproduction and a
whole lot more.

[SPEAKER_01]: Alright here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Busy as always but happy to be on another
podcast and spreading the information that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've accumulated over the last 20 years of
cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I'm super stoked to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you on so many different shows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean before we hit the record button you
had mentioned you're on over 100 different
[SPEAKER_01]: shows or podcasts, live streams,
whatever which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of information you give to
the community here is extensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off thank you so much for doing
that service because you've been helping
[SPEAKER_01]: out hundreds of thousands of people if not
millions of people throughout all these
[SPEAKER_01]: videos and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the people who you know there's
got to be some people in the audience here
[SPEAKER_01]: that don't know who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you introduce yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure my name is Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from San Diego but I currently reside
in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started cultivating medicinal plants 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a teenager 18-19 years old and I had
some OG, some older guys show me how to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then we were doing hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've since moved to doing living organic
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you guys are interested in any of
the work that I do you can find me at rust
[SPEAKER_00]: .brandon and you can find you know links
there to my company Bokashi Earthworks
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a biological fertilizer company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I specialize in microbial inoculants for
nutrient cycling, soil health and
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility and integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also own a 40 acre farm out
here in Oklahoma with my partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome and then I actually googled your
name before we met up today and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: the third link down if you google his name
Brandon Rust the third link down goes to
[SPEAKER_01]: Herbage Mag and there's actually a written
article about you kind of your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody's watching this wants to
learn the next level down about his
[SPEAKER_01]: journey here over the past 20 years is
definitely a good read.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only about a page long so but
definitely worth the read for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool so I think it's appropriate to just
start with the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that's actually something that
hasn't been discussed yet on my garden
[SPEAKER_01]: talk podcast off of any of the guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you could take you know roughly
five minutes or however long it takes to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of talk to us about what the food web
is and somewhat a basic or beginner
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly type way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure I'm sure that most of your viewers
are familiar with you know the food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that we got to see in elementary
school you know what eats what what's
[SPEAKER_00]: higher up in the food chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil food web is that same exact thing for
the soil and the species that interact the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that they you know release mineral
nutrients and it's basically just the
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of different types of
microorganisms micro and messa fauna and
[SPEAKER_00]: then macro macro flora and fauna as well
as arthropods earthworms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know it's a it's it's complicated
but really it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically just that there are certain
things that do certain things in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and they feed off of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work you know synergistically and
symbiotically with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically it is the web of life that
perpetuates life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all we're going to be talking
all about microbes today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to talk about the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to definitely get into a
little bit of chemistry here which has
[SPEAKER_01]: warned everybody I'm a beginner when it
comes to chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of this stuff actually might go
over my head which it might go over some
[SPEAKER_01]: my audience head as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's OK because we can always look
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can always do additional research and
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes over my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider myself a really intelligent
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read tons of white papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read literature all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The complexity of these systems is to be
able to really have a firm understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a really good
imagination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemistry and then you get into like
biochemistry and then you get into you
[SPEAKER_00]: know we might even touch on mechanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's endless almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the reasons that you
know soil science is so intriguing is
[SPEAKER_00]: because there will never be a point where
I come and say oh I can't learn anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll always be a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just taking people along with me as
I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what makes it fun for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of my audience does use synthetic
fertilizers right synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we often hear about salt buildup
resulting in problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when we're talking about salt we're
not talking about sodium chloride right
[SPEAKER_01]: that the table salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what exactly tell us what exactly is
salt from like a chemistry standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well when we're looking at typically when
we are looking at these systems in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway we are looking at chloride and
sodium and what happens is there are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain chemicals that are biologically
available for the plants to utilize for
[SPEAKER_00]: the specific functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever they may be for in these natural
systems you have what's called oxidation
[SPEAKER_00]: and redox potentials and essentially
certain elements are biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see this like for in pH right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it in pH and that is going to be
certain things are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bigger picture to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically when you're using synthetics
they're taking the chemical that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed by a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also in a chemical formulation to
where it's not going to where it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be affected by the oxidation and
redox potentials of those systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inherently you have kind of a dual you
have two systems right these organic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems which you know we still use things
like mineral salts but they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetically created right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones when you're you can get the same
effect with with either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what happens is with synthetic
fertilizers you're accumulating a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical compounds that are going to
interfere and have antagonistic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships with what you're trying to
absorb right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also oftentimes these chemicals are in
such high quantity that they are are
[SPEAKER_00]: grossly over applied.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grossly over apply a synthetic
fertilizer it can adversely affect the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology of that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can also affect the abiotic nature
of that soil which is anything that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: related all the different stress factors
that could be that aren't related with
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the weathering when you have those
types of chemicals they can tie up soil
[SPEAKER_00]: they can tie up nutrient they can cause
anaerobic conditions when they they dry
[SPEAKER_00]: out really easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't hold moisture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have different conditions that
eventually accumulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not to say that this can't happen
also in organic systems because it totally
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can accumulate things like chloride
and sodium in these inorganic systems as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll compile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again what it does is causes
antagonistic relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hinders microbiology from being able to
procreate and reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also comes at a great cost to
environment in the production of those
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I guess one of the ways that I was
kind of explained in to try to make it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit simpler terms I guess you could
say is you know when you have these
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced nutrients you're mixing in water
it's somewhat like binding to that H2O.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going into the soil right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant is uptaking it or it's
staying there and the water is evaporating
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you have what's left over as an
ion I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that ion isn't available to be
uptaken by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is are microbes able to
access that ion at that point and eat that
[SPEAKER_01]: ion or how does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a when you have a large
accumulation of antagonistic cations in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil it's going to make it so the
plant can't absorb that bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms fungi yeast they all have
amazing abilities to break down almost
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that is a hydrocarbon compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it is you know I guess any or
anything in organic chemistry because I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess organic chemistry doesn't
necessarily have to be natural in nature
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be synthetic but when we're
talking about organic chemistry we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about anything that is a
hydrocarbon compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said there is a microbe for
every compound because the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes that we have vary in such a huge
species of diversity and when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about at least when I'm thinking
about microbes I'm thinking of it kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like varieties of medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will have a lot of different effects
right because of the metabolites that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're producing or the the chemical
constituents that those plants produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microorganisms are very similar in that
they all produce different chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: constituents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these these are their secondary
metabolites just like the plants produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we'll see is there are some
bacteria like phosphorus, a solubilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They release an enzyme that's able to
release phosphate the only plant available
[SPEAKER_00]: source of phosphorus from inorganic
mineral compounds from rocks from things
[SPEAKER_00]: like calcium phosphate or calcium
bentonite or you know last night there's
[SPEAKER_00]: so many different types of calcium and
when we're looking at calcium as a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical we're not just looking at Ca
right it's always attached to something
[SPEAKER_00]: like CaSiO you know calcium silica or
calcium phosphate or you know calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: silicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these elements that we use in
organic farming are usually attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the mineral sulfates it is a
mineral it is considered a salt right
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's soluble in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take almost across the board
there is something for an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: situation if you need to make up for a
deficit that is immediately available and
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's you know I've heard people
say oh you can't get things immediately in
[SPEAKER_00]: organics and that's absolutely not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference between what you're
putting in right if you're using a mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: salt an organic mineral salt you can do
the same thing you can hamper a system the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way you could by over application in
a you know chemical system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're using something like a
meal anything that has a meal attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: it whether it's feather meal bone meal
kelp meal those are all things that
[SPEAKER_00]: biology is going to have to utilize to
break down to release into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that has a sulfate on the end of
it potassium sulfate iron sulfate zinc
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate these are all mined minerals that
come out of deposits whether it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: in a volcanic eruption a natural seabed
mine that dried out rock quarry their mine
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral sulfates but they're water soluble
or they have more solubility in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they don't all have the same
solubility right magnesium sulfate aka
[SPEAKER_00]: epsom salt has a way higher solubility
than let's say calcium calcium sulfate or
[SPEAKER_00]: gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about a huge huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know when we're talking about salts
we're talking about things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: soluble in water which you have to be
careful of too because we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: usually talking about a cation and there's
three there's four but there's three
[SPEAKER_00]: cations that we're looking at specifically
for you know when we're farming and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium magnesium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also sodium Na but that's
antagonistic to all three of those so we
[SPEAKER_00]: want sodium to always be as low as
possible because it's a it is a salt
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a cation and it's antagonistic and
it'll cause block out or lock out even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have adequate amounts of everything
you need in your soil let's say your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is perfectly healthy and balanced well I
guess it wouldn't be balanced if your
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium was up but let's say everything
else was good but your sodium is really
[SPEAKER_00]: high what's going to have what's going to
affect what is mostly going to be affected
[SPEAKER_00]: are those what are going to be affected
are those major cations the thing the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant relies on for the majority of its
biochemical processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha that's very interesting stuff there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in some organic gardening books it's
mentioned that feeding synthetic nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to kill off the microbes however
on online sources like there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening myth website it says that that's
completely false feeding in synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients you're actually feeding the
microbes so is it true that feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic nutrients are going to kill off
the microbes if so how fast do the micro
[SPEAKER_01]: populations die off when feeding these
synthetic nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well so I don't have any actual data
that's going to say this is exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: is happening and you know I'm a data
driven cultivator that's how I how I do
[SPEAKER_00]: all of my agronomy I look at what's in the
soil and stuff when it comes to biology
[SPEAKER_00]: biology is it's it's pretty resilient a
lot of these species have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: endosporlate which encapsulates their DNA
and they can survive in extreme conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's high or low pH ranges high
and low temperature ranges and all
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of abiotic and biotic
stress factors that being said it does
[SPEAKER_00]: hinder biology when you're using a bunch
of again you're talking about an
[SPEAKER_00]: organism's inability to use what it needs
what people don't understand is that
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria microorganisms are very similar
to plants I mean plants wouldn't exist if
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't for the relationship that they
co-evolved with with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms and the microorganisms also
require a diet right it's not just
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen and calcium right they need iron
they need manganese they need a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: same elements that plants need and again
if you go and throw a bunch of stuff into
[SPEAKER_00]: a system that's not balanced it's not just
a plant that's going to be adversely
[SPEAKER_00]: affected it's going to be the biology of
those systems however how can they
[SPEAKER_00]: sequester any type of nutrient if it's
just downright not available because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's this antagonistic relationship
going on does that make sense gotcha yep
[SPEAKER_00]: so not only that but from my perspective
and from you know what I've seen there are
[SPEAKER_00]: certain species of microbes that can
tolerate those high salinity high saline
[SPEAKER_00]: types of conditions but because
microorganisms are so fragile which is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like you know some species will be
able to survive those types of conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: what are they well you have to do your
research we know that certain species of
[SPEAKER_00]: bacillus bacteria are can still function
really well in high salinity conditions we
[SPEAKER_00]: know that there are certain strains of
trichoderma that do this there are there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like microbes for fucking everything but
when we're talking about specific microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: that are that we're utilizing in
agriculture for specific reason whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's to whether it's for their production
of selective target antibodies or whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because we want them to we're looking
for an enzyme production that they produce
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll eliminate that because we need to we
need to have conditions where we can
[SPEAKER_00]: promote the types of microorganisms that
are gonna vote that best benefit that
[SPEAKER_00]: species of plant in the environment that
it's in gotcha that makes sense and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of piggyback off of that talking about
getting into like large swings in micro
[SPEAKER_01]: population that's never a good thing right
you know generally they say that if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: flushing your plant for example you could
be flushing out a lot of those microbes if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're over fertilizing you could be
killing you know you could have that large
[SPEAKER_01]: swing in a population large pH
fluctuations is another thing that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard could potentially hinder you could
have a large swing in the micro population
[SPEAKER_01]: as well are there anything else or yeah
talk about that stuff a little bit so
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature pH hydrology those are gonna
be your three main components when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to which type of microorganisms are
are abundant in soil but also plant
[SPEAKER_00]: species and which type what kind of of
photosynthes are they releasing into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil what type of exudate because when
we're talking about plant exudates there
[SPEAKER_00]: are there are there is the science that's
gonna come out on this is gonna be fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: insane dude there is so many different
chemical constituents that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: construct to manipulate their environment
in soil whether it be the biological
[SPEAKER_00]: populations whether it be pH in the
rhizosphere all of these things are all
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it if you go too low on pH some
species will completely die off if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: too high if you're if you over water and
it goes anaerobic and you don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper biology to start with you could say
goodbye you know there's when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about explosive populations you
know let's say that your plants not let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say your plant struggling a little bit
right and you're like oh I can't figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what it is I see this all time just
from over watering over watering can look
[SPEAKER_00]: like so many different things and what's
happening is you're creating an
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and where bacteria that isn't
conducive to the health of your plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: able to colonize and grow so let's say
that this is kind of like the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: right you have this thing happening you
didn't catch it and then you go and like
[SPEAKER_00]: you think it's a nitrogen deficiency so
you go hit these things with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: amino acids right like soy hydrolysis what
you're gonna end up doing is you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: compile the problem that you have because
you just added a complex carbohydrate to
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil system where the predominant
microbe is something that's going to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant and you just gave them
something that they love so it's those
[SPEAKER_00]: types of I guess scenarios that that
biology can make a huge difference let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say you you have a root a flat full of of
clones that you're rooting right and you
[SPEAKER_00]: over water them in there they become
waterlogged right and all of those roots
[SPEAKER_00]: become anaerobic man how long is it gonna
take for you to recover with that and then
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say you go ahead and plant those
things and you're like oh again they need
[SPEAKER_00]: this or that and you try to add something
to the system and it just it throws it
[SPEAKER_00]: further to the left and not where it needs
to be you know what I mean yep absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: let's move on to pH up and pH down so I
get so many comments in my comment section
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of people really scared to
adjust the pH you know you know pH down
[SPEAKER_01]: for example a common thing that's used for
that is phosphoric acid pH up for example
[SPEAKER_01]: a common thing that's used is potassium
hydroxide potassium carbonate the common
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that said is if we're using these
things we're killing off the microbes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the medium or you know are we eradicating
the microbes in the medium from a few
[SPEAKER_01]: drops or a few milliliters of you know
potassium hydroxide potassium carbonate
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid you know if so what if so
do we know what the impact is on that well
[SPEAKER_00]: the again because one of those three
things I said earlier was pH large pH
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations are gonna definitely affect
the biology in the soil or what species
[SPEAKER_00]: can you know exist but if you're like you
know if your soil is at like six point
[SPEAKER_00]: three and you're like oh I want to get it
up to six point eight and you use you know
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all you're not gonna be able to
do that by phing your water right so phing
[SPEAKER_00]: for water is usually done for hydroponics
typically with organic growers they are
[SPEAKER_00]: already starting off with a good source of
water that's not high in sodium or
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonates and if you're where you
shouldn't I mean if you're running hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some cases where biology might be
important like maybe if you're doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa system where those are gonna be a
little more conducive to biology but
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not looking for you're not looking
for like biodiversity in these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro systems right because if if that was
the case then why are you even using
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics in the first place microbiome
microbes don't work as well in synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: systems as they do in organic living
systems so that being said if you're you
[SPEAKER_00]: know running like cocoa or a hydroponic
system where you're having to adjust pH
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're worried about biology you're
probably looking you need to be looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: specific types of microorganisms that can
help that that particular system out that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to be affected by those types
of swings as far as pH in soil typically
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're using a good clean source of
water that's low in bicarbonate and sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: and chlorine chloride sorry chloride you
shouldn't have to really worry too much
[SPEAKER_00]: about your pH as long as the soil pH is
where it needs to be because the soil will
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer the pH of the water as long as the
water is clean if you have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: bicarbonate in there and you keep adding
that in adding that in adding that in it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to slowly raise that pH up not only
that but it's going to antagonize your
[SPEAKER_00]: cation balance and the ability for calcium
magnesium and potassium as well as even
[SPEAKER_00]: your other cations for your micronutrients
which is going to be copper zinc iron
[SPEAKER_00]: manganese the only one that's not a cation
I think is boron and you know some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other ones that I didn't mention but out
of those ones out of the five major ones
[SPEAKER_00]: major micronutrients that are that are
responsible for a lot of the enzymatic
[SPEAKER_00]: processes folding of proteins and RNA in
the biomechanics I think the concern for
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the folks that are growing in soil
is that they're starting with a water
[SPEAKER_01]: source that's like a 7.5 or an 8.0 pH and
they're worried that that would have an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact and so adding in that few drops you
know two three drops of phosphoric acid to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that you know pH down you know they
worry about about that so that's why I
[SPEAKER_01]: bring up that question okay and then just
kind of touching on organic pH adjustment
[SPEAKER_01]: dusters versus synthetic so we talked
about like phosphoric acid for pH down and
[SPEAKER_01]: then potassium hydroxide and potassium
carbonate for pH up well some people okay
[SPEAKER_00]: since you're mentioning those particular
chemicals right phosphoric acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium hydroxide okay so a lot of
people who probably are using organic or
[SPEAKER_00]: who think they're growing organically
there is a lot a lot of these so those
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't organic chemicals but they are used
consistently across the board in number of
[SPEAKER_00]: products anything from like nectar of the
gods those types of products where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: a liquid nutrient what typically they'll
do they'll take something like bone meal
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll they'll dissolve it in the
phosphoric acid and so they're using an
[SPEAKER_00]: inorganic process for to release organic
substances that'll stay in a solution same
[SPEAKER_00]: with potassium products you know there are
potassium products that are labeled as
[SPEAKER_00]: organics but they've been so that's one
one of the things though those types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things in small amounts don't don't hinder
biology it's those it's those huge swings
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also if if your home grower and
your pH is high go and test your water and
[SPEAKER_00]: see why it's high because typically that
means you you have by card by carbonates
[SPEAKER_00]: and sodium in your water okay so and if
that's the case you should be using a
[SPEAKER_00]: filter or using distilled water or you
know you should be what happens in the
[SPEAKER_00]: systems is things can go fine for really
long time but you compile problems slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: it's why tell people you shouldn't be feed
you know I know a lot of organic growers I
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of them that use kelp meal
constantly and ocean inputs and it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: after you can pile all of these things
over run after run run after run dude your
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium and your chloride are fucking
skyrocketed it comes from the ocean let's
[SPEAKER_00]: think about this for a second you know
like the ocean is full of fucking salt so
[SPEAKER_00]: not only that but you have to remember to
heavy metals can compile the same way so
[SPEAKER_00]: even if something has a small amount of
heavy metals but you use it consistently
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently and consistently it will
build up over time so when some growers
[SPEAKER_01]: are saying you should be using baking soda
for a pH up versus you know potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroxide or potassium carbonate or using
lemon juice or vinegar for pH down instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of phosphorous acid you know would you
agree with that would you I dude it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the amount that you're applying for
that like okay so let's say I got a 50
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon reservoir right and it I need to
take it down by 0.8 the amount of whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: I am adding in there is just not gonna be
enough to really like mess that up it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's when you have these wide fluctuations
you know when you have way over watering
[SPEAKER_00]: and then way too much dry back and what
you know it's consistency is kind of key
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why the you know the blue mat
systems work so well if you have something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's consistent all the time you know
what to expect I love blue mats I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: just started using them and they're
awesome so good so one thing I learned in
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you touched upon it is that
different microbes are gonna function best
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of different pH values you know is
this true and then kind of what is that
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal pH range you know for soil and it's
for hydro that people should kind of stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with so here's the thing right the the
soil pH range that okay it's such a weird
[SPEAKER_00]: it's such a weird thing to address because
there's an optimal there's an optimal
[SPEAKER_00]: range for you know a soil list media and
then there's an optimal range for for you
[SPEAKER_00]: know medicinal plants but the ranges for
pH for different types of bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: different microorganisms is all over the
place depending on species right it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: typically all plants on earth will are
between five five and like eight at the
[SPEAKER_00]: highest usually I'm mean depending on you
know the type of soil that they're in but
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberries are something that is acidic
they like acidic soils and there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that like a little more calcareous
soils so or higher pH soils I mean that's
[SPEAKER_00]: you can say that about plants you can't
say that about microorganisms because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are microorganisms that prefer to
have an incredibly low pH range well
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some that have will only function
in a in a high pH range there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms that will not function at
all in the presence of oxygen there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: that are flocculative they can function in
high or low and there's some that only
[SPEAKER_00]: function in high oxygen environments
microorganisms are so abundant and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have so many different ranges but what I'm
looking at for the types of microbes that
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it depends on what I'm trying to do
with it this product right here from my
[SPEAKER_00]: company Bokashi Earthworks which is a
consortium of several different bacillus
[SPEAKER_00]: species non-purple sulfur bacteria right
up pseudomonas plustrius and also a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: and also yeast which is saccharomyces
cerevisiae also known as Brewers yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: very that yeast is very common it's found
in soils it's found on fruit if for this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular product if the pH doesn't go
below 4.5 it won't stabilize you know so
[SPEAKER_00]: for this specific consortium although they
can operate in a wide pH range from like
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.5 all the way to like 8.5 if I want them
to do a certain thing and stay have viable
[SPEAKER_00]: spore it has to be at a certain pH right
so where they're suspended in solution
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all alive and they're waiting for
the opportune environment to where they
[SPEAKER_00]: start procreating microorganisms are very
strange like this small things can can
[SPEAKER_00]: change what's going on we also know that
there are certain microorganisms that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can't even you know we can't culture in
laboratory settings they only exist in in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature and they can't be grown and
cultured because their nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements think about it like this if
you had a medicinal plant that had this
[SPEAKER_00]: really crazy wild nutritional need and it
was not typical to what you knew you
[SPEAKER_00]: usually want and it's just all over the
place and you would have to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what this is and it was only this
one special mix that you would never find
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere else for any other plant in the
world is the only thing that would make
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing grow it's how it is for some of
these biology for some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms in these biological systems
some of them will only exist well a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain species of plant is present and
it's giving in that plant is releasing a
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthate and exudate into the soil
that's going to sustain the nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of that specific microorganism
gotcha good information there for sure so
[SPEAKER_01]: let's talk about kind of the soil
temperature in in a sense so one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I've learned is that the lower the soil
temperature in the medium the slower
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes move that being said what is the
ideal soil temperature for microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: activity you'd be surprised to see 84 to
98 degrees Wow for most species you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really interesting when you
increase your VPD and you're running high
[SPEAKER_00]: temps high humidity in soil systems you
get way better nutrient cycling capacity
[SPEAKER_00]: your phosphorus is gonna is gonna cycle
better so will some other things this is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've seen from data that I've
collected right and it's like this this is
[SPEAKER_00]: why when you think at least when I think
of how to culture a microorganism you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you have certain environmental factors
microbial incubators are typically used to
[SPEAKER_00]: culture different types of spore and those
ranges are usually between 84 and 98
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees depending on the species in the
bacteria or fungi whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're culturing now they there are
different species that do better at higher
[SPEAKER_00]: lower temperatures like we talked about
earlier higher lower humidity but what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen in soil is that when you have
higher temperature higher humidity this
[SPEAKER_00]: the everything works better as far as
nutrient cycling capacity when it when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing how things fall into
solution especially for phosphorus so yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: soil temperature we got cut off for a
second but um so you know I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: things from you know how do you how do you
grow microbes and usually you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at higher humidities higher temperatures
and when you and the same thing applies in
[SPEAKER_00]: these systems when you have the higher
humidity and higher temperature you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to retain more moisture as long as
you have a really like for these modified
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mixes that most of us organic growers
are using they're highly porous so that
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizes the gas exchange capacity of
that soil which means there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen there's it's able to retain the
moisture while still having a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen and have those higher temps it
allows for these populations of microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: to really you know really cycle it just
increases their activity you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: see this too if you go and say you mixed
up some fresh compost and some amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some like alfalfa stuff like that
and when you put it into your tote you
[SPEAKER_00]: know to cook you get the mycelium you get
all the bacterial and fungal growth all
[SPEAKER_00]: the mycelium mats you know when you're and
it's because you have those those nice
[SPEAKER_00]: warm conditions when everything starts to
cycle right when there's a lot of food for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to sequester and there's a lot of
things to be broken down there's plenty of
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon plenty of nutrient that those
environments usually warm up and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: because of all the activity they can get
too hot obviously we've seen that with
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic compost where it you know
gets too hot I've actually seen compost
[SPEAKER_00]: light on fire before but yeah those those
temperature ranges seem to do better with
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher humidity and higher temperature
ranges obviously when we're growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plant we don't usually want to
exceed a leaf temperature of 84 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're able to you know really
maximize that environmental condition
[SPEAKER_00]: where your nutrients are all on you know
they're sufficient balance and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: also have supplemental co2 your VPD is in
range if it's not if you go higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: those temperatures it has a hard time with
some of the the enzyme mechanics of
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis or not photosynthesis but
with the creation of chlorophyll and you
[SPEAKER_00]: really have to have everything dialed in
if you want to you know maximize that but
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal range man if you can run your VPD a
little bit higher without going over and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keep your humidity up but
consistent because one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know will cause bacteria to grow bud
mold particularly is if you have huge
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations again it's that those
fluctuations from where your consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: vape VPD and it either drops or it goes
too high consistency is kind of key is
[SPEAKER_00]: what I've seen as long as you have
consistency across the board things seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to function pretty well gotcha yeah
because you know soil temp isn't something
[SPEAKER_01]: really that a lot of people talk about you
know since the soil temp has such an
[SPEAKER_01]: impact on microbial activity should we be
monitoring it more closely like would you
[SPEAKER_01]: consider the soil temp just as important
or even more important than the canopy or
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf surface temperature it's a really
good question and it's not something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really done a lot of science on I
haven't really delved into what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening at different temperatures you
know I haven't even really taken soil
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures to be honest so it's
something that it piques my interest
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely and it's another data point
that could be taken into consideration
[SPEAKER_00]: while we're looking at things like the
soil test saturated paste test the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue and the sap testing you know how is
soil temperature affecting things I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: usually not looking at soil temperature
I'm usually looking at RH and temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know those are the things that I'm
mostly looking at surface temp on the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're using LEDs LEDs is a little bit
more complicated in my opinion gotcha okay
[SPEAKER_01]: so switching it up a little bit so general
question here when the soil dries out
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes go dormant right it's kind of
like a sleep state for them do some
[SPEAKER_01]: actually die at that point if the soil
dries out or no or like when you've
[SPEAKER_01]: rehydrated kind of they wake back up from
that dormant state yeah so there are
[SPEAKER_00]: different microorganisms that are going to
be ubiquitous to the environment they're
[SPEAKER_00]: all around us those types of
microorganisms will reestablish themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: however if there was like a specific
microorganism in that system it could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be eliminated unless it has
the the the ability to endosporulate like
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked about earlier so some varieties
a lot of the bacillus species they have
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to encapsulate their DNA into
an endospore and those endospores they
[SPEAKER_00]: create like a wax coating they're really
resilient to different type of biotic and
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic stress factors and that's what
makes them such a prevalent species in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and so when they do dry out if you
have large microbial populations what will
[SPEAKER_00]: happen is you'll have a lot of tiny tiny
little microorganisms that create these
[SPEAKER_00]: wax coatings and that's what causes soil
to go hydrophobic so if you've ever seen a
[SPEAKER_00]: really really dry soil you pick it up
throw on water it floats it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: completely rehydrate until that soil will
actually sink and it's because and so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing same thing could happen
that's really what you are gonna be more
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about because you can always
re-inoculate or you know those populations
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna naturally come back once you
rehydrate that material the problem is it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be really difficult to rehydrate soil
that's gone hydrophobic and oftentimes it
[SPEAKER_00]: takes something like a surfactant so you
can get that penetration into dry spots so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that is really the main concern
with with you know letting your soil dry
[SPEAKER_00]: out but yeah it'll come back you know
there are microbes in that soil they will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to be there some of them will die
out here's an example right anything
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be like an anaerobic species
which is most of your most of your
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens like your fungal root pathogens
are gonna be optimal they're gonna have an
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal operation in in low to no oxygen
conditions so if you let your soil dry out
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's no more oxygen in that soil
you're going to be eliminating a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that that species do you recommend folks
use a wetting agent every time they water
[SPEAKER_00]: no no no it's not necessary no it's not
necessary I I mean I don't ever use a
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactant unless and unless it's like a
IPM foiler or if your soil has gone
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrophobic okay interesting yeah I've
heard recommendations to just use it every
[SPEAKER_01]: time because it doesn't really cause harm
it would it would help the soil in the
[SPEAKER_01]: long run but so I was just curious on that
one well well here's the problem if you
[SPEAKER_00]: were gonna use this I I don't know if this
you know this is just my thoughts on it
[SPEAKER_00]: really if you were gonna use a surfactant
like yucca or something or every time that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watering I would assume that at
some point unless you're really letting a
[SPEAKER_00]: I water every day you know so for me if I
was to use a surfactant every day it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of cost effective it wouldn't be
cost effective it'd be waste of money but
[SPEAKER_00]: also you know what that does is it
basically makes water wetter and when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in a system a living soil system
where we want to have the maximum amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of gas exchange I don't want to create any
anaerobic conditions in my soil so over
[SPEAKER_00]: watering or you know I would think that if
you did that constantly over and over
[SPEAKER_00]: every watering that you could could
potentially create problems but it's never
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I personally experienced
because the only time I use a surfactant
[SPEAKER_00]: is for coverage for IPM foilers or again
for hydrophobic soil got it that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense okay inoculating the soil so how
often should growers be inoculating the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil I mean there's some growers out there
that two three times a week they're
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculating you're using manumeth P
they're using you know great white then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're adding some recharge and you know
can you really go overboard with these is
[SPEAKER_01]: there a general recommendation for how
often you should be using them you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely go overboard on your bank
because a lot of those things a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things are expensive man you know
what I mean and great point look I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: tell I'm gonna I'll tell you what guys
everybody that's listening there I I
[SPEAKER_00]: collect data all the time and I do a
massive amount of research there are so
[SPEAKER_00]: many products out there that are so
overpriced or have such small colony
[SPEAKER_00]: forming units that they're gonna be
unaffected and then you need to be asking
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself what's the purpose of this
inoculation if you don't have a clear and
[SPEAKER_00]: concise understanding of what the purpose
of or what metabolites those specific
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms do then you shouldn't buy
them because there's so much
[SPEAKER_00]: misinformation dude and I see it all the
time even by professionals and I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain style and I'm not saying that my
style is the only way because there's more
[SPEAKER_00]: than one way to skin a cat but when it
comes to empirical data that is
[SPEAKER_00]: representative over and over and over
again I'm looking at specific microbes for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific jobs I don't use my risal fungi I
don't use my risal fungi for a reason and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one of them the huge ones right I
will be able to tell all your audience and
[SPEAKER_00]: my audience after my next harvest whether
or not there's even an association with an
[SPEAKER_00]: arbuscular or an endomycorrhizal fungi
because there's tests for that now so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can see if there's an endomycorrhizal that
has penetrated into the root itself what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen over and over is that the cost
to inoculate with a lot of these things I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get any return on it it doesn't do
anything it doesn't do anything if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have a healthy balanced soil in fact I've
read research which has shown in different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that the symbiotic relationships
between mycorrhizal fungi can become
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic when the plant no longer
requires what the benefit is that that so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's for instance let's say your
mycorrhizal fungi is releasing phosphatase
[SPEAKER_00]: or a phosphorus solubilizing enzyme into
the soil and that's its job so this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: releases a photosynthate that is geared
for that microorganism to keep it around
[SPEAKER_00]: in an exchange it'll release the phosphate
that the plant needs now let's say that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's all good in some you know agronomic
field setting where you're growing a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: in field conditions but let's take that
same scenario and we put that in a system
[SPEAKER_00]: where all your nutrition is adequate and
you have adequate phosphate what ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: happening is the plant no longer requires
that symbiote that once symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship to cycle that phosphate into
that phosphorus into phosphate the
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically available form and so the
plant stops releasing that photosynthate
[SPEAKER_00]: now this thing we're talking about we're
talking about an organism that has or
[SPEAKER_00]: could have possibly infiltrated every
single aspect of this plant's root system
[SPEAKER_00]: and then that plant stops releasing what
it needs it has control of its whole root
[SPEAKER_00]: system what is it gonna do it's gonna take
what it wants because it can
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms can do amazing things and
Matthew Gates think angel on IG who's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great IPM specialist we talked about you
know how easily these types of
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships can switch and something
that might be mutualistic can become
[SPEAKER_00]: parasitic very quickly it's something to
take into consideration now we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: science and all the data for you know what
I particularly cultivate however moving
[SPEAKER_00]: forward as I'm able to collect more data
and more types of tests are become
[SPEAKER_00]: available we'll be able to see how how
these work right I prefer trichodermis
[SPEAKER_00]: trichoderma bacillus subtilis combination
and that's because the trichoderma will
[SPEAKER_00]: colonize the root without causing and
without a it's not a it doesn't go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the the cell itself bacillus subtilis will
and the trichoderma will will facilitate
[SPEAKER_00]: that and they have this mutualistic
partnership together where they're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate almost all fungal pathogens and
it's because of trichodermis high affinity
[SPEAKER_00]: for iron the metabolite that it produces
is the highest iron affinity chelating
[SPEAKER_00]: compound in nature and that's the city of
force what I've seen in organics is that
[SPEAKER_00]: iron is very very hard to fall into
solution and biologically available for
[SPEAKER_00]: various iron fe2 plus it oxidizes so
easily in a pH range from 5.5 to 7 that as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as you add something like iron
sulfate which was should be an immediately
[SPEAKER_00]: available form and oxidizes into Fe3 plus
so having a high iron affinity microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: that can reduce or I guess oxidize Fe3
plus into ferrous iron and make that
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically available you're gonna have a
greater impact on that plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic capabilities so we're when
to inoculate and what what to inoculate is
[SPEAKER_00]: I think more important you want to be able
to add the right microorganism that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do the right thing I personally I
inoculate this product weekly but I'm also
[SPEAKER_00]: creating a new product because what I've
seen is that by using that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: product weekly that that purple non sulfur
bacteria it's a photosynthetic bacteria
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's releasing nitrogen into the soil
so if I have adequate nitrogen I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop using that at a certain point so what
I'm doing is I'm constructing a different
[SPEAKER_00]: consortium that's more geared for
phosphorus and micronutrient release as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to phosphorus and then getting the
added benefit of the photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria that are adding the nitrogen
really really good stuff there for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: one last thing I want to get into before I
let you go I know you're extremely busy
[SPEAKER_01]: person talk about the rate of reproduction
for these microorganisms so compost teas
[SPEAKER_01]: often used to extract microbes from
compost and then there's the brewing
[SPEAKER_01]: process where there's microbes are
reproducing what do you know about the
[SPEAKER_01]: rate of micro reproduction you know you
can either talk about like the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: teas versus just adding composts into the
soil and letting them reproduce there and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have any tips for faster reproduction
besides what you mentioned earlier it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to vary it's really going to vary
you know something that might be really
[SPEAKER_00]: persistent in soil might not do so well in
water you know so there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different factors when it comes to when it
comes to culturing microbes and it's you
[SPEAKER_00]: know really only the strongest microbes
are going to be able to survive so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a complex carbohydrate like
molasses and you go and do some compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea I wouldn't go you know you you have a
certain temperature range right that we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about those are ideal for the
production you also want to make sure you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's so tricky man it's such a hard
question because like like like my
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes I wouldn't oxygenate them to
reproduce them I would solid-state ferment
[SPEAKER_00]: them right there it's it depends on what
you're trying to go for and and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing compost teas for just a general
biology I mean you're just guessing anyway
[SPEAKER_00]: so I mean brew it don't brew it longer
than 36 hours that's my advice they're 24
[SPEAKER_00]: to 36 hours is optimal if you're gonna do
compost or amendment brews I personally do
[SPEAKER_00]: not use compost teas I will use compost
teas for bioremediation for land you know
[SPEAKER_00]: for agronomic settings but that's because
those things are already so deficient I
[SPEAKER_00]: can add so much into it in any amount and
it's still like I could still add more in
[SPEAKER_00]: most cases you know because we're building
the soil health and fertility they work
[SPEAKER_00]: great I think there's a huge disconnect
between soil science for agronomic crops
[SPEAKER_00]: for like earth for like farming on land
and then using modified growing mixes
[SPEAKER_00]: because me personally I don't use things
like earthworms in my or crop covers at
[SPEAKER_00]: scale it doesn't make sense what happens
when you add earthworms to a system that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're monocropping it turns all that
organic matter into castings which creates
[SPEAKER_00]: compaction in your soil so you have this
really really really light soil from that
[SPEAKER_00]: has great gas exchange to this really like
heavy poop worm poop you know which means
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to add a massive amount
of aeration you're gonna have to add a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amount of calcium amendments to
break that open break that apart so I was
[SPEAKER_00]: totally disconnected now that I'm
collecting data and I'm monocropping for
[SPEAKER_00]: just my medicinal herbs I take a different
approach you know I'm not trying to do all
[SPEAKER_00]: this crazy stuff I'm literally just
maintaining sufficiency and balance in a
[SPEAKER_00]: system when it comes to my when it comes
to our outdoor and tilling the land and
[SPEAKER_00]: bioremediation and using microbes and
compost teas and composting and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: covers all that yeah and it's the reason
is because what we're starting with is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is not very good soil
structure is not good aeration is not good
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter is really low nutrient
density is really low probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with sodium you know so these are
the things that we're looking at and why
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so important to have like your soil
food web science for agronomic crops for
[SPEAKER_00]: like food crops for like moving towards
the future when I'm talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I've already created I've
mixed the proper aeration I've mixed the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper nutrient into it I don't want to do
anything else to it it's almost like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: taken like you know something that would
have maybe taken 50 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: bioremediation to get to this point that I
have in a bed or a pot I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: change it now I just want to maintain
sufficiency and balance I don't you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: will put in the selective target
microorganisms that are gonna have PGR
[SPEAKER_00]: responses or that are gonna you know be
there to out compete any types of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens or to cycle nutrients but I'm
looking at target specifics in these
[SPEAKER_00]: modified systems now when we go out of
that realm and we're looking at soil
[SPEAKER_00]: systems we're looking at biodiversity
we're looking organic matter crop cover
[SPEAKER_01]: gotcha whole different world whole bunch
of good stuff there for sure you can get
[SPEAKER_01]: really deep on that level so awesome well
yeah wrapping things up how can listeners
[SPEAKER_00]: find you and what do you have upcoming in
the future yeah so we are ramping up
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor production on the farm I'm working
on some new microbial products I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get I'm trying to get a
building for Bokashi I've been doing out
[SPEAKER_00]: of my garage forever and I just can't do
it here anymore there's a lot going on I
[SPEAKER_00]: am always in motion I am always doing
something you can find me at Russ.Brandon
[SPEAKER_00]: on IG you can find a link to Black Label
Organics my farm Bokashi Earthworks my
[SPEAKER_00]: corporation and I also do private
consulting too so yeah for soil samples
[SPEAKER_01]: right so if somebody would get a soil
sample they can contact you and you would
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of consult them on that evidence yeah
so I work with like very few people
[SPEAKER_00]: actually and the reason is because of my
time and also because I'm usually working
[SPEAKER_00]: with owner-operator farms and we're
looking we're you know we have a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: goal in mind I don't typically just do
like oh hey somebody wants to test I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do it I do however you know I'll
help people out man like I I was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: to a guy on Instagram and he's like dude
can you look at this soil for me he's like
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought this fresh soil company in
Oklahoma and I was like dude like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: this is terrible like this is like they
literally took a bunch of peat and then
[SPEAKER_00]: put some perlite in it and then sold it to
you like there's no nutrition in this it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's completely empty so I you know I DMed
the company and said hey I'm you know I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a private consultant and I don't know
what's going on here either maybe you gave
[SPEAKER_00]: this guy a bad batch of soil or maybe you
guys don't understand target levels but he
[SPEAKER_00]: can't grow this he can't grow in this and
this is a small family farm this guy's
[SPEAKER_00]: relying on this soil you know for his
livelihood and it's like dude it's foster
[SPEAKER_00]: rating dude I hate seeing that because
that dude would have been screwed you know
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm gonna help them out I'm gonna get
them all dialed in and you know be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: be productive makes sense makes sense I
will leave a link to Brandon's Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: down in the description section below so
you can easily click on that and give him
[SPEAKER_01]: a follow on IG Brandon thank you so much
for coming on to the podcast today it has
[SPEAKER_01]: truly been an honor to have you on this
podcast you have revealed so much
[SPEAKER_01]: information here in this is something I'm
gonna definitely rewatch and have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: notes for on myself because there's a lot
of stuff here that I didn't know and now I
[SPEAKER_01]: am a stronger grower because of you so
thank you for that and yeah I'll let you
[SPEAKER_00]: go and hope you enjoy the rest of your day
thanks man it's always a good time when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to help and share so I appreciate
you you you you
