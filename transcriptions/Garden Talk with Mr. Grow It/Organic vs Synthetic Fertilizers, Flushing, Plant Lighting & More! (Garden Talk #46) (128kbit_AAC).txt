[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a general rule, we have found that
about 80% nitrate and 20% ammonium keeps a
[SPEAKER_00]: very stable pH in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic fertilizers break down to the same
exact elements that synthetic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemically, there's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the stress that improved the
terpenes, not the organics per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is precision stress
could lead to more terpenes and especially
[SPEAKER_00]: precision stress can lead to more
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put the plants in the dark,
we're taking away their energy source to
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly lots of growers do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a common practice, but that just
because it's common doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grote, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 46.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Dr. Bruce
Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a professor at Utah State University
and the president of Apogee Instruments.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he gets deep into plant
science, everything from synthetic versus
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, silica, flushing, soilless media,
lighting, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.

[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Dutch Pro for sponsoring this
podcast.

Dutch Pro is a plant fertilizer company
[SPEAKER_01]: that has base nutrients, additives,
and pH regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different formulas of base
nutrients for if you're in soil or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in hydro or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also formulate their base nutrients
for if you're using hard water or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using RO or soft water.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Dr. Bruce Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am actually a student of yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm enrolled in the cultivation
certification that you offer at Utah State
[SPEAKER_01]: University.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm learning a ton right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much amazing science about the plant
that we all know and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel honored to be able to learn
from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thankful for your willingness to
come onto the podcast and share
[SPEAKER_01]: information today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually what we do is we'll start off with
an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into this space?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we went way back, I got I started in
college in engineering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that meant building things and
building boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got onto the idea of building
plywood boxes to test different plant
[SPEAKER_00]: environment interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built those boxes and a lot of other
gizmos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go through graduate school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it was at the University of
California Davis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was at Penn State.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different degrees, different schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my first job out of college was
the position here in Utah, Utah State
[SPEAKER_00]: University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had the opportunity to early on to
write a proposal to NASA for growing plant
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That proposal got funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as people say, the rest is
history.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been now here for 40 years working on
plant environment interactions in growth
[SPEAKER_00]: chambers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 1980s, 90s, 2000s, all of this
stuff was funded by NASA for food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the potential to work on
botanical medicines came along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growers subsequently have funded our
research, growers and some lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got into medical hemp research in
the last four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it plugs right into the large
infrastructure we already have in the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have something like 45 growth chambers
here to manipulate environments for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the laboratory is connected to
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's growth chambers and greenhouses
adjacent to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's jump right into the juicy questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your Reddit AMA that you did a few
months back, you said, quote, I'm not a
[SPEAKER_01]: fan of organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, organic agriculture is not
always good for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not always good for human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, organic is great for
recycling waste back to gardens and farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: This recycling saved the planet,
end quote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you elaborate on what you meant by
saying that organic agriculture is not
[SPEAKER_01]: always good for the environment and not
always good for human health?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were my comments, and they still
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand that shocked a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People didn't expect me to say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really got into agriculture because
of organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, many decades ago, I was going to
save the planet through better,
[SPEAKER_00]: more sustainable agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is in Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started growing vegetables and I had
a little roadside stand and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started studying it and I went
back to school in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let me start by saying the principles
of recycling are just a gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: We absolutely need to recycle things back
to agriculture way more than we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a fundamental tenet of organic
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recycle things back to agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recycle the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a terrific gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get into the details of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one example is manures, which we rely
on heavily for nitrogen to recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to be recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it turns out manures are very high in
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put on manure to get the
adequate nitrogen, this is composted
[SPEAKER_00]: manure now, so it's safe because official
organic standards require significant
[SPEAKER_00]: composting to make sure it's safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just put fresh manure on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you put manure on to get nitrogen and
the phosphorus is way too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do it again the next year and the
next year and the phosphorus builds up to
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphorus is a serious environmental
pollutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of organic fields that
are putting phosphorus into lakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what we really should do is put the
manure on to get adequate phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: find the nitrogen somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then this problem would be gone and we'd
be recycling manure and we could put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more fields too because there's
ample phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one example of the challenges
of organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it comes down to precision
fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much, not too little, the right
ratios of the nutrients at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's difficult to do with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sort of do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get rock phosphate and green manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly my colleagues are working on
this at some other universities to recycle
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen, especially with green manures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing a crop every other year,
all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all wonderful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the application of it, nutrients
become imbalanced and there's a danger to
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's underappreciated by people that
are enthusiasts for organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The principle is good, but there's been
big challenges in the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can say that about conventional
agriculture too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we want to grow a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put synthetic fertilizers on and
there's nothing really wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic fertilizers, but boy do they get
overused too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like conventional farming is
all good and organic is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that way at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The applications of it are challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a long answer to the environmental
part of this, but it's not always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our attempt to recycle everything,
we get nutrient imbalances that have
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, synthetic fertilizers, they have a
bad rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're officially in the generation
where organic growing is a growing trend.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are bad things about synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such as the runoffs of nitrogen and
phosphorus into lakes and streams causing
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic algae blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are also some good things about
them, such as the fact that because of
[SPEAKER_01]: their invention, we can now feed the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of the pros
and cons of synthetic fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe some misinformation that you've
heard about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, synthetic fertilizers
allow precision fertilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a principle, this is really a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now does every grower do precision
fertilization?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, is there a lot of examples of
over application of fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listened to a talk at the National
Agronomy meetings last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was about one of my colleagues at the
University of California, Patrick Brown,
[SPEAKER_00]: who was just a really good speaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he was given a keynote talk that he
was talking about fertilizing fruit trees
[SPEAKER_00]: in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he made some joke about if you don't
know what you're doing, put a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: on and more on having a dual meaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just kept putting more on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's California agriculture of
fruits and nuts and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a tough time getting growers
to back off because they get paid by
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no penalty for polluting the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's synthetic fertilizers that they're
using.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, let's just take nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get almost all of the nitrogen from
fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the Haber-Bosch process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two German scientists around World War
One, both of them got the Nobel Prize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's considered this great breakthrough
above the balls of science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they figured out how to make nitrogen
fertilizer from the nitrogen in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's plenty of nitrogen in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what's allowed us to feed a
whole bunch more people in the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But boy, does it take a lot of fossil
fuels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to recycle nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the actual projects we're
working on right now with NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA is recycling nitrogen in a Mars
colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to get nitrogen on Mars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they have minimal nitrogen in their
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recycle every molecule of nitrogen in
this colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're sitting here doing this
research and my God, we need to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans, we excrete 12 to 20 grams of
nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: per day in our urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And none of it's recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes into landfills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I envision the day when we're going to
have small scale separators to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: the salt and urine from the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as unpleasant as it might sound,
you can purify urine and get the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: and put that right back in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of that's done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we keep saying, oh, put a little
more on, then we're never going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there with recycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the principles are rock solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I don't like about organic
agriculture is just this complete ban on
[SPEAKER_00]: all synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't often get to good places as a
human species by banning things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to change behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some hybrid between recycling through
organics and limited use of synthetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is a really good approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually came across a fantastic study
that talks about what would need to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to feed the world with organic
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, switching to 100%
organic production leads to further
[SPEAKER_01]: increases in land use between 16 and 33%.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to make up for the lower yields
that organic growing results in.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the study, it's on average of
8% lower yields with organic agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: up to 25% lower yields depending on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought that was super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually provide a link to that study
down in the YouTube description section
[SPEAKER_01]: below for those of you tuning in on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The study is titled Strategies for Feeding
the World More Sustainably with Organic
[SPEAKER_01]: Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was posted in Nature's
Communications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely give that a read if you're
interested in learning more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are some growers out there that
say that the terpene profile for
[SPEAKER_01]: organically grown plants is better than
with plants grown with synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any truth to that or is that just
a myth?
[SPEAKER_00]: As a scientist, I just say the data points
in this direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say that's a myth, but I would
say we don't have any good evidence to
[SPEAKER_00]: support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In spite of looking, we can't ever say it
would never happen, but we don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: evidence to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a general principle, terpenes and
cannabinoids both are what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they're not, the plants don't
have to make them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will grow just fine without
them, but the plants make secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites like lignin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they stand up straight and be tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a secondary metabolite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could grow a plant with all cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's these secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that if you stress plants,
precision stress plants, they often make
[SPEAKER_00]: more secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is precision stress
could lead to more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially precision stress can lead
to more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is a very active area of
research in my lab right now, precision
[SPEAKER_00]: stress of plants to improve quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone makes a broad statement,
organics improve terpenes, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the mechanism for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a potential mechanism if the
plants were slightly stressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's the stress that improved the
terpenes, not the organics per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we look at refining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I call this precision stress
rather than just general stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the right amount of stress in
the right way at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've no doubt people have done studies
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say people and studies,
I mean, growers have done a comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a better way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they might've seen more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often if they don't have a background
in the scientific method, they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat the study, they just make one
observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're sure that organic
nutrients increase terpenes and they make
[SPEAKER_00]: announcements and they're just sure of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And boy, can you get into trouble as a
scientist if you make some announcement
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're wrong, your reputation goes
right in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you ever say is the data indicates
this and we've repeated it four times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also can say here's the mechanism by
which this happens, not just an
[SPEAKER_00]: observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the analogies I've used sometimes
is planting at the full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 100 years ago in agriculture,
that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should plant at the full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get better yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course that's been studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the mechanism of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no mechanism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably what it was is people could
see better at the full moon so they've got
[SPEAKER_00]: the spacing right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no mechanism for a value of
planting at the full moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because there's no mechanism,
we think the observations are just random
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I often hear is people say
that synthetic fertilizers kill off all
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you feed in synthetic nutrients,
you're wiping out your micro populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are microbes killed with synthetic
fertilizers or is that another thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: the data doesn't really back it up yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I want to make this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people know this,
but I want to make the point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic fertilizers break down to the same
exact elements that synthetic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So chemically, there's no difference at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They aren't taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taken up by the plants until
they're degraded to the elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, the exact
same elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you put a ton of fertilizer on,
I mean some cup per plant of synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, you would kill the plant and
you wouldn't kill the microbes because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would sure shift the microbial
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over fertilize it just because of
the salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can see where I'm going with
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the mechanism?
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly, if the fertilization is
near optimal, there could be equally be a
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial effect on microbes as a
detrimental effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes have to have a source of energy
and that source of energy is usually some
[SPEAKER_00]: organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in a simplest case, you could just
put some sugar on the soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes would go wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have a huge flush of microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you say, well, that's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how about we just take compost and
partially degraded compost and put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will stimulate microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether that also stimulates plant
growth is another question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would not necessarily stimulate plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the opposite of synthetic
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic fertilizers don't have organic
matter in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And organic fertilizers, because they have
organic compounds in them, will stimulate
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, as a general rule,
that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want healthy microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil, but so does root turnover.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big plant stimulates microbial activity
because you have a lot of roots and the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots turnover and microbes thrive on the
decaying roots of an older plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long answer, but the short answer
is no, there's no relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic fertilizers and killing the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about soil versus soilless
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another trend is growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many growers work towards feeding the soil
instead of feeding the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: so relying on micro and macro organisms to
work in the soil, ultimately resulting in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant receiving nutrition that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, one could argue that
soilless media has more benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a media more optimized for growing
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the benefits of
soilless media, porosity, water holding
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity, canary exchange capacity,
things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, interestingly enough, this is
another active area of our research for
[SPEAKER_00]: NASA.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we going to grow plants on Mars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we going to haul earth soil to Mars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, way too heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also are not going to grow,
at least initially, we're not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in Mars soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a fine sand is what's up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil means it has microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we call Mars is regolith.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sterile and it's sterile sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we turn that into a healthy,
vibrant thing to feed a Mars colony so
[SPEAKER_00]: that that research has implications for
Earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we could do liquid hydroponics,
which we do a lot of in the lab here.
[SPEAKER_00]: No media at all, just deep flow
hydroponics, roots and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the ultimate in precision
fertilization, because you can change
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients on a dime and you know exactly
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants can be dead in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we move to soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this can be rock wall, could be
coconut quire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be peat, many different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But rock wall, coconut quire and peat are
really the big three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That that most people use.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's better buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you missed an irrigation,
your plants wouldn't be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has that can store some nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That primary and it can have a robust
microbial community in it, too,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly peat and coconut quire,
because those are made out of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: products to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock wall is a little different,
because that's just glass fibers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no organic matter in rock wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this then gets to a concept called
cation exchange capacity, which the
[SPEAKER_00]: listeners, if they get interested in this,
please apply to Utah State University for
[SPEAKER_00]: a degree in plant science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll learn all this stuff in great
detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're interested in plants,
you'd love coming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have you as a student here.
[SPEAKER_00]: in our plant science department.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take whole classes in what we're
talking about right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rock wall doesn't have any cation
exchange capacity, which means there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you miss a fertilization, the nutrients
are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They washed out of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coconut quire and especially peat have a
reservoir of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cations are bound to the media and it
buffers it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put too much on it soaks up the
excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have too little, it desorbs back to
the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're moving from straight liquid
culture, which can be very precise,
[SPEAKER_00]: but fragile, to soilless media,
which is better buffered for the long
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third category would be soil,
which is your original question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go dig up field soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to make it really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put lots of compost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fine media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's in a container, it's very
tricky to keep it watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy to overwater it and flood
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have a tall container to help
it drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why traditional field soils are
not generally used in containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's so easy to flood the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible to grow in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do all the time because we're doing
studies to predict field responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you sure have to be careful about
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the microbial activity is determined
by the amount of food in the container for
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes, the amount of organic carbon
that they can eat, that they can utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: for energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil has some organic carbon,
but peat is all organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbial activity is not
necessarily higher in soil than it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: soilless media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another long answer, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you teach this stuff for 40 years,
you start to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more information, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our viewers really like detailed answers
to the point, the science behind things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in another one of your lectures,
you talk about feeding different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, ammonium, and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you came across some interesting
results with feeding a balance of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what that study
was about and your findings there?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, in the field, we virtually
always have both forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often, as organic matter decays,
the first form of nitrogen is ammonium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is NH4 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in forests, that's the dominant form
of nitrogen that's feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decomposes to nitrate, NO3 minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a microbially mediated
transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called nitrification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different organisms that's
very cool to take a whole class in this
[SPEAKER_00]: that do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work in tandem to change ammonium to
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the field, plants almost always get
both forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've really long known they're
synergistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a cation, one's an anion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help the plants achieve what's called
charge balance, because you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: an equal number of cations and anions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stabilize pH right in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rhizosphere is right next to a root.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stabilize that pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a general rule, we have found that
about 80% nitrate and 20% ammonium keeps a
[SPEAKER_00]: very stable pH in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say about that, that could be plus
or minus 10%, depending on the conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we feed all nitrate, the pH goes
up, up, up, up, up, and that's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we feed too much ammonium, the pH goes
down, down, down, down, down, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not good either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this roughly 80-20 balance helps the pH
stay stable right at the root surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for all the crops we've studied,
it leads to a healthier plant and faster
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super interesting stuff there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an environment question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know that it's not so much the
temperature of the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the leaf surface temperature,
which is impacting the rate of
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I often hear that it depends on the
plant you're growing and the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, 82 degrees
Fahrenheit leaf surface temperature is
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any truth to that, or what's your
take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell my students, the correct answer to
every question I'm going to ask you is,
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm starting with, it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now what does it depend on?
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just take leaf temperature and
air temperature first, just as not the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimum, but just what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: A worst case scenario would be a cactus in
the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no water, and the sun is shining on
the cactus, and the surface of the cactus
[SPEAKER_00]: can be, oh, it could be 20 degrees Celsius
above air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily tens, and you double that for
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20 to 30 degrees Fahrenheit above air
temperature of a cactus in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way different than air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's take the opposite,
a well-watered plant in agriculture with a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's say, are the leaves warmer
than the air or cooler than the air?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now most people would say,
well, duh, the sun's shining on the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always warmer than the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if we took a wet dish rag and
hung it on the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's soaking wet, and it's evaporating
real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that dish rag be warmer than the air
or equal to the air temperature or cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out the dish rag will be
cooler than air temperature if it's a low
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low humidity means less than 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaves are not necessarily always
hotter than the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how well-watered the plants
are and what the humidity of the air is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're cooler than the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you have good wind speed?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we almost always have good wind speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like the leaves to be fluttering like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is the leaves either
warm up or cool off so they're even closer
[SPEAKER_00]: to air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a manuscript on this,
a model with leaf temperatures and
[SPEAKER_00]: different kinds of lights, different
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a validated model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But well over 90% of the time,
the leaves are within, in Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're within three degrees Fahrenheit of
air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a wildly different temperature
for starters.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think, oh boy, we gotta control
temperature, because that'll be way
[SPEAKER_00]: different than the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is different, but not a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we get away with measuring
air temperature and predicting plant
[SPEAKER_00]: performance from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the leaves are close to the air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a well-watered plant, what if the plant
runs out of water, the stomates close,
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration goes down, now the leaves
heat up, three, four, five, six degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: above air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in that case, we got another problem
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They ran out of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fix the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're on to the second part of your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the optimal temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say the leaves are at the same
temperature as the air all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What temperature should that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the carbon dioxide is not enriched,
it's just ambient, plants have what's
[SPEAKER_00]: called photorespiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have trouble distinguishing carbon
dioxide and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ambient CO2 that means the
temperature optimum is lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it depends on the crop, but often in
the low 20s, well, it's in Celsius,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the low 70s Fahrenheit is an optimum
temperature without CO2 enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we elevate the CO2, which we do all
the time for plants in controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're spoon feeding the plants carbon
dioxide, which is what they want for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to make a lot of biochemistry simple,
now they can go faster because they got
[SPEAKER_00]: ample CO2 so we can raise the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that temperature gets into the 80s
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's at least a five to 10 degree
Fahrenheit increase in optimum temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: if the CO2 is elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's another interaction with the
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we said all of this, which is a
whole bunch of stuff all at once,
[SPEAKER_00]: what really matters about temperature is
the flower bud temperature, not the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those flower buds don't transpire as
much as the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a clump of tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower buds can heat up well above air
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at optimum conditions,
we really ought to be looking at flower
[SPEAKER_00]: bud temperatures more than leaf
temperatures, because we see it all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll heat up easily five degrees
Fahrenheit above air temperature when the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower bud gets bigger, when it's closer
to harvest, just because it's a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a clump of tissue as opposed to a
nice thin leaf, which can stay close to
[SPEAKER_00]: air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, some really good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that about the flower
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a big discussion of that in
one of our manuscripts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to dig into it,
those manuscripts are written for other
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists, so they can be tricky to read.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those discussions are certainly in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got some controversial questions for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned before we started
recording, most of my audience is on the
[SPEAKER_01]: home-go side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of things that people do
in order to try to get a better result.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, some growers will put
their plants in a period of darkness
[SPEAKER_01]: before harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, 48 hours of darkness or 72
hours of darkness, then they'll harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It said that the darkness period is when
secondary metabolites are formed and
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes fall into that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: So giving your plant a period of darkness
will either allow the plant to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: more trichomes and or allow the terpenes
and cannabinoids to become more potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is leaving your plant in a period of
darkness before harvesting beneficial at
[SPEAKER_01]: all?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of those things I'm going to
say we don't have any evidence that that
[SPEAKER_00]: helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's back up to the theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say trichomes or terpenes and
maybe trichomes are formed at night,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're synthesized out of the energy from
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The photosynthetic energy makes sugars
especially sucrose, and that sucrose is
[SPEAKER_00]: used to make the terpenes, makes the
trichomes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we put the plants in the dark,
we're taking away their energy source to
[SPEAKER_00]: synthesize terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't specifically done these
studies here, but my colleagues in other
[SPEAKER_00]: places have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a general rule, the terpenes are
less when they're in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're respiring away all the
sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't make new terpenes because
they're out of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my recommendation to growers,
and this is based on principles and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: think are best practices, keep the lights
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is even some people that go to
24 hours of light because they don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: to trigger any more reproductive
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to push the plant hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other extreme, the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But cool temperatures can reduce the
volatilization, which is the evaporation
[SPEAKER_00]: of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're in the dark and cold,
now the cold temperature might help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the dark, but it's the cold
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there could be some evidence for
keeping the plants, keeping the lights on,
[SPEAKER_00]: but reducing the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had to go off of mechanistic
studies, that's what I would recommend,
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're reducing the development
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's cold, it doesn't synthesize
new terpenes as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not clear to me that the coldness
would really help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would help preserve terpenes,
but it would not help the plant synthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: new terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that we're smelling the plant
at all, which you do, that means the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are coming off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what makes the smell in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we ought to put more emphasis
on continued synthesis of terpenes right
[SPEAKER_00]: to the last day of harvest and less
emphasis on doing something to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: what's already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that information is going to open
up a lot of people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely mentioned some things that
I wasn't aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that really provides a lot of
information in regards to those folks that
[SPEAKER_01]: are in belief of that happening,
kind of give some background and some
[SPEAKER_01]: science to refute that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Chris, let me add to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the moment of harvest,
now you clip the plant, now there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: more photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's starting to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can cool it off to try and
preserve terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: During curing of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's different because once you clip
it, it's starting to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within hours, photosynthesis,
still mates close right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthesis is minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question was right before harvest,
not right after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another technique that's often done by
gardeners growing with synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers is flushing or leaching before
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic growers generally don't do this,
but many synthetic growers are adamant
[SPEAKER_01]: that a flush is needed prior to harvest in
order to reduce the amount of chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately leading to a bit faster of a
cure and a better tasting final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on flushing or leaching
before harvest when using synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly lots of growers do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that just because it's common doesn't
mean it's correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant was over fertilized,
and sometimes we over fertilize on purpose
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some osmotic stress, some salt
stress, then there's the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing out the excess nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps the plant take up more
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for the plant to get water out
of salty soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's excess nutrients,
that's all salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get rid of the excess, and now it's
just more pure water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant can hydrate better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a case where flushing has the
potential to be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there were no excess nutrients
right up to the end of the growth cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any mechanism that flushing
would help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in that case, it's a stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's take nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need nitrogen to make chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get rid of the nitrogen, chlorophyll
synthesis would start to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has to exhaust all of the stored
nitrogen in itself, because plants store
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They store nitrate in vacuoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can take at least several days,
if not a week to exhaust that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't see a mechanistic link between
the value of flushing and product quality
[SPEAKER_00]: if the plant didn't have excess nutrients
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting you mentioned organic
growers usually don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe they didn't have any excess
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had just the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you go less than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't realize that the half-life of
a chlorophyll molecule in a plant is two
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are always making new chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make new chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the moment of harvest, the
chlorophyll starts breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a half-life means half of it's gone in
two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's plenty of opportunity to get
rid of chlorophyll right after harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: during the curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, that's a big part of curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the right speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some things to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, you want to get rid of excess
water so you can store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, that's another topic,
the curing side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quick answer is, with some rare
exceptions, I don't see the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: flushing before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some growers that we've worked with
tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't prove anything except in
their operation, they didn't see a value
[SPEAKER_00]: of flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a pretty big grower that had been
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, we don't have any evidence
that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, OK, we'll try it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely changed my stance on
flushing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some things that you mentioned
that I wasn't aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, moving right along to drying and
curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done any studies on drying and
curing that you can talk to us about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're about to do a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, most of our studies have
been rate of drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dry plants in two days,
and you can dry them in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, the word drying applies to the
rapid, rapid loss of water that occurs in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first 24 hours after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And botrytis, for example, can go wild on
a flower that's got plenty of water in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we get rid of botrytis and all
the other microbes that can grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower is just to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dry it fast and maybe 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm using the term 24 hours,
not one day, because this stuff is hour by
[SPEAKER_00]: hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's 28 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to set your stopwatch and
watch this stuff dry fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to over dry it, but we want
to get it dry enough so the microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: counts are low.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plenty of places for microbes to grow in a
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we cure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I use the term curing for a
real slow loss of water that happens over
[SPEAKER_00]: many days and two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks is about as long as I've seen
people curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll degrades.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additional water is lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to preserve the terpenes,
trying to keep those in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabinoids aren't going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get concentrated because you're
losing water, but you're not losing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about the water activity of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water activity is a number between zero
and one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is fully hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right when it's growing, the water
activity is probably 0.99.
[SPEAKER_00]: You harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days later, it starts to dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the water activity is 0.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at a water activity of 0.8,
not many microbes can keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've gotten rid of 95% of the microbes,
but some can still grow with real low
[SPEAKER_00]: water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we take it from water activity of 0.8
down to 0.6.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at 0.6, the microbes can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can, when it's fully cured,
the middle of the flower is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edge of the flower is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can put that bud in a jar and keep
it for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too dry for microbes to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's separating drying and curing for
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would think we would learn a lot
from the tobacco literature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been growing tobacco for 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about curing tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a bit surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much literature on
precision curing of tobacco as you might
[SPEAKER_00]: think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe part of it's because it's done
by private companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they try to keep their curing methods
confidential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The curing, anything, any medicinal
plants, how do we take basil and make
[SPEAKER_00]: dried basil?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want that basil to be really flavorful
and aromatic and still dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can put it in a jar and ship it
around to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can learn a lot about curing from other
types of food products, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: principles are all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say most of my audience is familiar
with PAR, PPFD, PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: But DLI is something that I think a lot of
people are getting tripped up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about DLI and what's
optimal for medicinal plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So DLI is daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get this, then you can say
that you understand calculus, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And calculus is a pretty scary word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But integral is just adding things up over
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a really good analogy that I have
used, and my colleagues use it too,
[SPEAKER_00]: is a rain gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go out and check your rain gauge at
the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't really care when it rained.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just care how much it rained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's say you got an inch of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rainfall integral for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you imagine a tray out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With raindrops falling into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't care if it rained hard for a
while and light for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, we care what's the
total amount of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same thing with photons
coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We measure PPF, PPFD, PAR per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, but the plant says, I want to know how
much I'm going to get per day,
[SPEAKER_00]: not per second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we add it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that results in the number called the
daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those numbers outside range from five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, we talk about
micromoles per meter squared per second
[SPEAKER_00]: for instantaneous light, PPF and PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you add them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all those micromoles become moles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's moles per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the daily light integral,
the unit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at a low end in the winter,
we might get five moles per meter squared
[SPEAKER_00]: per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a sunny day in the summer,
we get 60 moles per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with electric lights, you got to have
a lot of electric lights even to get to 30
[SPEAKER_00]: moles per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 will grow fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got a lot of evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still keep increasing yield up to
60 moles per meter squared per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of lights to get to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the concept of daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's worth it to become familiar with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of this, my company, the company I
started, Apogee Instruments, makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of products to measure daily light
integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sits there and adds up all the
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, it gives you a
number for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to have a microprocessor in
the sensor to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't had many instruments to do
that in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But oh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you typed in daily light integral in
Apogee, you would find these sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are also calculators online.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's new to DLI, you could type
in DLI calculator and just kind of get an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type in what the PPFD is and then the
number of light hours and press the
[SPEAKER_01]: calculate button.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will tell you what your DLI is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes things pretty easy having a
calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I believe you did a study about
replicating the natural sunlight by
[SPEAKER_01]: starting the lights on a lower setting,
then increasing the output over a period
[SPEAKER_01]: of an hour or two, and then dimming the
light gradually before lights off versus
[SPEAKER_01]: just hitting the plants with full power
lights all the way until the lights turn
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I remember correctly, the plants took
the full power just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't really a benefit to gradually
increasing the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that study?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that actually was a study by a
colleague at the University of Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: Don Geiger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't working with medical hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working with other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He looked at ramping it up slowly and
ramping it down slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, and I have talked about his
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and I have discussed his research
at length.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we have done is measure
photosynthesis one minute to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we take these plants that are sleeping
in the dark and boom, we turn on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and they get to full brightness in
under a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast do the plants wake up and get
going?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes several minutes for them to
get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't take several hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And which is an interesting analogy to
people, you know, you think, I like to get
[SPEAKER_00]: up and have coffee, I got my slippers on,
you know, don't ask me to do hard math.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right after I wake up, I got to ramp up
into the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least plants we have studied,
boy, can they ramp up fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, their most productive period
of the day is the first couple hours after
[SPEAKER_00]: the lights come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we haven't, we don't have any evidence
that it helps to ramp the light up slowly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, you lose the opportunity to
give a lot of photons to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just turn them on and leave them
on, that's the results in the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: daily light integral for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any evidence that a slow
ramping up or a slow decrease is helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got kind of a loaded question for you
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer it however you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But talk to us about your findings in
regards to light spectrum and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two parts of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is the effects of light spectrum on
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one, the effects of light spectrum on
plant shape or development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know a lot about photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the last couple of years,
we've had a huge breakthrough on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my laboratory and in my colleague,
Mark Van Niersel's lab and Shu-Yung Jin,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's now at Texas A&M.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very clearly found that far-red
photons cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we're defining a new metric for
light for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called E-par, lowercase E and
then PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means 400 to 750 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That range is photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The old way was 400 to 700, but now we
have 400 to 750.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, companies are now making
E-par meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee makes an E-par meter to include the
far-red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that range, the red photons are
basically better than blue and about 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: better because blue photons get absorbed
by pigments that aren't photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anthocyanins, carotenoids, they get
absorbed and they don't cause
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that leads to colors of light for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should include far-red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bigger effects of light color and
light quality are on plant shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're on the synthesis of secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: If blue light shrinks plants, and if you
want small compact plants, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them more blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why years ago we used to give
plants in veg light from metal halide
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, because it had a lot of blue light
and the plants were nice and compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would switch to the more
efficient high-pressure sodium lights
[SPEAKER_00]: during flowering because they could get
more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now LEDs come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most LED fixtures have low amounts of
blue light because it's not as
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue LEDs are not as efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't need that much blue light for
optimal photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the amount of blue light, it controls
stem elongation and leaf expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing a lot of studies now in
the minimum amount of blue light to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: normal looking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One in 2% blue photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we give the plants far-red photons,
it significantly increases stem
elongation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can shape the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally we don't want big tall
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want smaller, compact plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want air flow through the canopy,
we want taller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can really control plant height
with light spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can even control how dense the
flower buds are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a tight flower buds,
you want more blue light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want it to be elongated more,
you would give it more far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Far red photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the flower bud gets a little bit
more spaced out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then now what's consumer preference?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the shape of the flower that people
want to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control that with light spectra.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a quick summary of a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point that interested me the most was
I wasn't aware that the blue light,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it impacts the density of the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was not aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's new information to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about UV light?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your findings there?
[SPEAKER_00]: People have said UV light will increase
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people, I mean, many growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they often cite a paper by a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first author is a guy named Leiden,
L-Y-D-O-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a paper about 30 years ago on the
effects of blue light and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was not for medical hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was for photo protection from UV
light from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Leiden only studied leaves and how
much the leaves made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they made very low levels of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: His data were all in a few tenths of a
percent in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He only studied vegetative plants,
no flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cultivar, there was no effect of UV
light on cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the other cultivar, there was an
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said in his paper, the effect of UV
light on cannabinoids is equivocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you look up the word equivocal and it
means uncertain, unknown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody cites Leiden's paper as
proof that UV light increases
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what he found at all in his
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would invite everybody to study his
paper and read it carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have studied UV light in
cannabinoids, both UVB and UVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've never been able to show a
beneficial effect of UV on cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least for the cultivars we have
studied.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have our colleagues at the
University of Guelph also published a
[SPEAKER_00]: paper on this, independent of our
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found the same thing as we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another research laboratory at another
university finds the same thing as we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't mean we can't find exactly
the right dose and the right wavelength
[SPEAKER_00]: that might be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is not going to be easy because
we've tried multiple doses and multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: wavelengths and we've just never seen a
benefit in spite of the fact that UV
[SPEAKER_00]: should be triggering these photoprotective
pigments.
[SPEAKER_00]: In theory, we think we should see an
effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In practice, we've never been able to show
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, lots of good information there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One last thing I wanted to talk about,
I know probably coming up close on time
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one thing I wanted to bring up was
talking about silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done a ton of research when it
comes to silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've watched your presentation
that you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information that you
mentioned in there that's not really
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned to the general public,
from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of your main
findings with the research you've done?
[SPEAKER_01]: With silica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, silica is not essential, but that
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very highly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And silica is what glass is made out of,
silicon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants take up silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get lots of silica in the field
soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes into cell walls and it makes
them tougher.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like glass in the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the big advantages that makes
them more resistant to diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give our plants real high silica and we
almost have eliminated powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of evidence that helps plants
become more resistant to insects as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly the chewing insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenge is how to get it in the
root zone because it's not a very soluble
[SPEAKER_00]: element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been working on papers on how to
increase it in liquid feed with a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: injector.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also compounds that we can add to
media to elevate silica in the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a very beneficial element,
especially because the trichomes are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost pure silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want a lot of trichomes and we want
them tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them to fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want them to be fragile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And silica helps with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in soilless media, no silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: That people add soil to get silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can add it from silica
fertilizers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we're moving to a thing with no
silica just at a time when we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: adding more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So silica is a very underappreciated
beneficial element, particularly for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that you brought up the fact that
it strengthens the trichomes because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really one of the main things that
nobody talks about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impact on the actual trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're aiming for when
we're growing these medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So great stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely recommend that everybody have
silica in their feeding routine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what new science has come out in the
past year or so regarding these medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think some of our threshold work,
recent work and also the near future is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the interaction between
genetics and environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: New strains, new cultivars, new
chemotypes, and then new environments to
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think of the history of
agriculture, half of our advances are
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and half of our advances are
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better fertilization, better watering,
but better genetics too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that same thing is going to have to
happen with medical hemp, particularly as
[SPEAKER_00]: we get professional plant breeders
involved that can do molecular techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that medical hemp,
very labor intensive to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trimming sugar leaves, it's just a
lot of labor to get it just right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In field agriculture, we have bred plants
to be easier to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes, I mean, we've bred plants that
right at harvest, the tomatoes break off
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant real easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could breed medical hemp to make it
easier to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one example of many.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could breed medical hemp so it can take
a 16 hour photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can give it more light and get higher
yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things, I think they're in
the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you asked about the past, the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: One big project of ours is phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The unfertilized flowers suck up a lot of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't do anything, it's just excess
phosphorus, but they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can cannibalize phosphorus out of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for that reason, medical hemp benefits
from more phosphorus than most other
[SPEAKER_00]: crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not 10 times as much, maybe two times
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to get people to back off
to precision fertilize with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adequate phosphorus, but not excessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all the reasons we talked about in the
beginning, it's a bad environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: pollutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm waiting for companies to say,
our medical hemp, sustainably grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't over-fertilize with phosphorus,
but we got to give them the data so they
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much is enough so they don't
suffer from yield from inadequate
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could go on and on and on and ask you
more and more questions, but we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have lots of videos on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have taught, as you know, because
you're in the class, but this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: university level course online,
and it's about 50 lectures of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff I've been talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just expand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the first group of students in that
class, the class is now closed for
[SPEAKER_00]: registration, but we are already,
because of an overwhelming response,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're already preparing a second edition
of the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be a more advanced edition of
the course, but it's done with two
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues and recorded here in our
recording studio, so the quality is high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're really gratified with all the
people, all the good comments on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I can say watch for more
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do videos through Apogee instruments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do some through the university,
but those videos I think have been more
[SPEAKER_00]: effective than writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for the grower audience,
they're a lot more effective than
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific papers, because those papers
can get pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have what's, just tell me the
bottom line from all this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will leave a link to Dr. Bruce
Bugbee's YouTube channel, your Apogee
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave that down in the description
section below.

we mentioned that organic study,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll be linked down in the description
