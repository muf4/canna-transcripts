[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water temperature and environment
temperature is critical for this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially during this rooting stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that higher, warmer temperature
to encourage the root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep a rooting hormone in my
SOPs every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely three stages of
rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is callus, the next is striking,
and the third is searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in theory, if your plants are
green to begin with and they turn purple
[SPEAKER_00]: in your rooting stage, yeah, you got to
adjust what you're feeding and what your
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation is trading your trays with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than likely, you got to match
what that plant previously was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start reading the backs of labels of
products and bottles, what the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: active ingredient is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed what the mother plant you cut from
what's being fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to change it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, AKA Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Paul, the clone
coach.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Paul is an expert when it comes to
cloning, so I figured I'd base this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to clone,
and it can be a bit challenging at times
[SPEAKER_01]: to get clones to successfully root,
depending on the method that's used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really want this episode to reveal
some good best practices that will help
[SPEAKER_01]: the listeners be successful cloning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get into cloning that deep,
let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gardening since my late teens as
a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants always interested me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started back in the day just by getting
seeds from chilies and stuff that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: eating and propagating them, germinating
them, and then putting them in little
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And growing that same plant and eating
peppers that we had for dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of showing the rest of the family,
hey, you know, all these seeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: inside could become other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just had a hobby, gardens, you know,
growing up and stuff, but always had a
[SPEAKER_00]: love and a passion for plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you know, earlier in my career,
I was traveling a lot, so I couldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a garden because I was always gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was kind of always, you know,
kind of in the back of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But finally, when I stopped traveling for
work, I was able to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: garden a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always a good passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good therapy, and I encourage others
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into just some basic
questions to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have another cloning episode on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody's interested, we get real deep
into the process, kind of step by step on
[SPEAKER_01]: how to take clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe if you search my name,
Mr. Growett, and then clones or how to
[SPEAKER_01]: take clones, it should pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's with Trey Strongs from CLTV.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode right here, we won't go
over the beginner type details,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it will certainly involve a lot of the
details needed in order to be successful
[SPEAKER_01]: in various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first question I have for you is,
why is it important to take clones from a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy mother plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the importance of it is that the
fact that the mother plant and your clones
[SPEAKER_00]: they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything that your mother plant is
experiencing, good or bad, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: show it in your clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, clones, you always want to
have the best start possible because your
[SPEAKER_00]: crop is essentially riding on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking clones from the healthiest
mother plants being, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: no stress, no environmental stress,
you know, fully acclimated to their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, fully fed nutrient wise,
you know, no deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to give you the best possible
product in the next stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cloning from a healthy
mother plant is vital and it's the first
[SPEAKER_00]: step to producing the best possible stock
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do take, if you do happen to
have a plant that is showing a sign of
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies, maybe you're starting to see
nitrogen deficiency to begin and you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: wait around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take those cuts that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can the person still be successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that clone still going to root so on
and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that clone could recover and then
turn out to be a usable plant or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: just totally recommend that the plant has
to be a hundred percent healthy in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to take clones off?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if life is working against you,
you have to cut off of that plant when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not in the best stage possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to do what you got to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting is one half or one portion of
creating, you know, a proper clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant can still root if it's a bit
deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the top half of that plant,
the stem and the new growth and the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to show its deficiency a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get the plant to root,
but you're going to take a lot more time,
[SPEAKER_00]: an extra week, two weeks to bring that
plant health back up to a stage to where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's acceptable to move on to the next
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually if that's the case,
you'll have roots on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you move up the stem, you'll go
from green to purple to purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: darker purple, and then your inner nodes
are going to be really tightly spaced and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really not a lot of developed
growth when it comes to the cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is a very broad question,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But kind of to narrow it down a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain time to take cuttings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like does the plant need to be a certain
height, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what part of the plant I heard
that, you know, there's differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between taking cuttings from the bottom
part of the plant versus the top part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, some good rules of thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you want to take cuttings off of a
plant that's been growing for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I say about 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Undisturbed, undisturbed meaning no
topping, no pinching, no bending.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want that growth to be
undisturbed for a good 12 to 14 days
[SPEAKER_00]: before you cut that growth, which is,
you know, nine times out of 10 going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: off the top of the plant, right beneath
your lights, if you're in an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cloning from the bottom of the
plant in the indoor setting, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting direct light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your stems are going to be a lot
thinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your plants are not going to be
as developed and not as hardy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it can and will root,
but your clone is going to be just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit weaker, a little bit,
you know, behind everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not used to the intensity of the
light and the food and kind of the rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: activity happening inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's best recommended to have your
plant grow for about 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take off the growth that's been grown
right underneath the lights there and have
[SPEAKER_00]: as much cross-contamination practices in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have clean scissors or
clean scalpel, clean razor blade,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say clean, you want to use
products that actually get rid of viroids
[SPEAKER_00]: and viruses and anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroid being like the main thing nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, alcohol doesn't kill
the viroid, you know, according to all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these studies and everything that are
being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, an easy product that
everybody has access to is bleach,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% bleach, you know, a 30 second to one
minute dwell time is about what they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not a quick dip in a rinse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There actually has to be a dwell time on
the surface of your tools in between
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut off the new healthy growth and keep
clean tools to make those cuts off your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're saying isopropyl alcohol,
which is very, very common that people use
[SPEAKER_01]: to sterilize their equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying that's not sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not sufficient as far as a viroid
goes, being hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a really big concern and a lot of
commercial grows nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's good for other practices,
but, you know, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: too, if we take a step back, you need to
wash a surface before you sanitize the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the surface has debris, already has
plant material on it, or has any buildup
[SPEAKER_00]: on it, and you just dip it into alcohol or
anything else, you're not getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of that tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So alcohol takes you so far, but a clean
surface and the right product will
[SPEAKER_00]: guarantee you better success as far as
your tools go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you take that cutting,
right, I guess size of the cutting is one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I kind of want to get a little
deeper into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, I've heard about six
inches at the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly it'll root with, you know,
smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can root larger than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on the size of cutting to
take?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using traditional domes,
humidity domes, that's a seven inch dome
[SPEAKER_00]: on average.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want your plant to be
touching the top of that dome for 14 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, accumulating humidity and
condensation on, you know, that fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: growth up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be about an inch below that
so that, you know, and you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: plug in your stem into your cloning media
about an inch or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that six inches, you know, an inch goes
into the media and you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple inches of play with up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So six could be a little bit short once
you plug it in and put it into a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just above that six inch mark is kind
of where you want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be dependent on the
development of the plant and kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: new nodes and the fan leaves coming off of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to base it on the top nodes and
the newest growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down to the bottom of the stem on a nice
cutting mat, you know, line my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my new growth there, my stem at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's usually a 45 degree angle on your
cutting mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a nice clean cut and you know,
it's not going to be perfect and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you have a little bit of play within
the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're treating the entire tray
as one, as one canopy, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: play quarter inch here, half inch there is
just fine in the grand scheme of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just over six inches should be perfect
for a seven inch dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you sterilize your scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've taken that cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will dip it into a rooting
hormone, although that's an optional step,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you, is there a particular type of
rooting hormone that you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe talk about like liquid or as a
powder, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful out there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's new hormones coming
onto the market as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all have that same active
ingredient, which is kind of what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to start reading the backs of labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of products and bottles, what the actual
active ingredient is in your products and
[SPEAKER_00]: what strength and or percentage is in that
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for rooting hormones, indole,
indoburic acid, IBA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a few different
strains of IBA, which I think like a
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid will have one strain or two strains
combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a powder will have, you know,
the other one and gels have an indole
[SPEAKER_00]: indoburic acid as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal favorite is Clonix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been around forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's new products out there and
I want to give them a shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go side by side and,
you know, see how they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say rooting hormones are optional,
but it's just a staple in my SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, you want to help trigger,
you know, rooting and striking the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what that hormone does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, why not give, you know,
the plant everything it needs for that
[SPEAKER_00]: short period of time you're expecting it
to do, you know, a lot of, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, you know, creating a catalyst,
striking roots, creating a root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and all this stuff during the
rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to keep a rooting hormone in my
SOPs every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you dip it into that rooting
hormone, it could go into a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: different things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can actually put it into a cube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put like a root riot cube is
what I'm referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it into rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could put it directly into soil or
cocoa, which is what I often do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do kind of like the lazy man
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to go buy the rockwool or
cube directly into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it takes a little bit longer to root
from my experience, but it still will root
[SPEAKER_01]: under the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they skip all that and they just do
aeroponics, aeroponic cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another broad question for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the differences
between those things and how the success
[SPEAKER_01]: rate can vary and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a general statement,
the environment needs to hold a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of moisture and a certain amount of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ratio is what the stem and root
zone really needs to to begin its rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: process and to go throughout its reading
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as we get a ratio of moisture
to oxygen, that's why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could do it in cocoa soil and all
these different medias and a plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: strike roots and will grow and will do its
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the the rule of thumb
and what is needed on a basic level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as far as different methods go,
like aeroponics, I used to do that back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day, but it's a bit finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like any other aeroponic system and
or hydroponic system or deep water culture
[SPEAKER_00]: system, where if there's any variation in
your parameters, you're more than likely
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a timer goes down or if the water
chiller is not chilling water or any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues like that happen, you have very
little room for margin for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really need to have a close eye on
your system to ensure there's no hiccups
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout your rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: That moisture to oxygen level gets created
in that environment in the aeroponic
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your temperature is off or anything
like that, you could have some issues and
[SPEAKER_00]: is not an easy way to recover from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different types of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwool is a traditional one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been used for who knows how long and
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're going to go into
another Rockwool cube, that's where you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to start off with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great starting point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a good moisture to oxygen ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people squeeze the cubes for whatever
reason they have in mind, but I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say they come from the manufacturer with
a certain ratio that they could hold so
[SPEAKER_00]: much moisture and not hold anything more
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't squeeze any of the Rockwool
cubes like most people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any cubes really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oasis cubes is like a floral foam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another good slab to use,
but it's very delicate when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like pulling it out of the box,
it just falls apart when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so delicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it gains moisture and you
saturate it, it's good to go and it holds
[SPEAKER_00]: its place and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a good media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's also the root riots like you
mentioned, and I think that's a great
[SPEAKER_00]: option for like hobby growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or people that aren't doing too much
production too often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that because you still have to
manually saturate the cubes and then fill
[SPEAKER_00]: in your 50 cell trays or however many
cells you're doing in a tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to manually plug all of those
individual cubes on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a big deal, but when you're doing
commercial scale, that's a lot of labor
[SPEAKER_00]: that is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a commercial scale, my personal
favorite are the IHORT trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Excel trays to narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a few products, but those come
pre-filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that 50 cell tray comes pre-filled with
a cocoa base media with a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite and some just way to keep it
compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could break it down like soil,
but it holds its shape when it's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cube and it's in the tray and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my personal favorite because it
comes pre-filled.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you save a ton of labor when it comes
to the commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could clone and root in most
medias.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got to work with that ratio of
moisture and dry backs and oxygen and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff to encourage the root growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know temperature is another thing that
kind of you got to keep an eye on,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly in soil or cocoa is
primarily, like I mentioned, what I clone
[SPEAKER_01]: in or stick my clones into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had issues where I didn't really
monitor the temperature and it was too
[SPEAKER_01]: low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was on the ground and it just,
it wasn't high enough temperature in that
[SPEAKER_01]: medium in order to promote the growth so
that the plants started to die off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see the leaves started to become
yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then I went and put a heat
mat on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Common thing that people use heat mat
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it recovered, you know,
all it needed was just heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heat mat is another thing worth
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if you're having trouble getting
that, the temperature to where it needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, heat mat is definitely something to
look into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't recommend, you know,
throwing the tray on the floor because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the coldest spot in the room,
especially if it's like a concrete floor
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, it's the coldest
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the closest to your root zone or
where you're trying to create a root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence, you know, the issues you just
described will, will definitely happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, keeping it elevated off the
ground, you know, getting a good,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the temperature is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, water temperature and
environment temperature is critical for
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant, especially during this rooting
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need that higher, warmer temperature
to encourage the root growth and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get that root zone and get,
get activated.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rooting process, it's three stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing some digging on your YouTube
channel and saw a video that you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the three stages of rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's definitely three stages of
rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is callus, the next is striking,
and the third is searching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and the callus stage happens in the
first few days of the rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially your stem is going to form
a callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to, you're going to see thick,
almost scaly, bumpy growth come off of
[SPEAKER_00]: your stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the first stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where that rooting hormone
helps aid in this process as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to create that first callus
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your stem is going to form a,
you know, callus all around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll notice sometimes too,
like if you cut off of a fan leaf or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, and you, you leave a
wound that'll start to form a callus there
[SPEAKER_00]: too, if the environment's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the plants just want to form and do
that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the callus, you're going to strike
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just tiny little nubs that
are just like little spikes, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: little, just little spikes coming off this
callus that are just beginning that root
[SPEAKER_00]: striking stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happens between like days four
and seven, kind of the middle stage of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after the striking stage is a
searching stage and is essentially where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're creating your root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're encouraged, you're encouraging
the root growth and searching to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to show the roots a bit more in the root
ball by, by doing these drive backs and by
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing moisture levels so that the roots
are forced to search for water and in
[SPEAKER_00]: doing so they're displaying themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're creating a bigger root zone and
they're out there actively searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, coming in contact with the root
inoculant that's in your slabs,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in contact with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what will get you through your
process a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's three stages of rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're having any issues with
rooting and you tear apart one of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your cubes, you could see what stage it
made it to, or did it make it past?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, you could help diagnose
where you're, you're having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's not even creating a callus and
you know, you, you realize, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, the temperature was too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put this heating mat and all of a
sudden it's formed a callus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's striking roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to diagnose where your issues
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you form the callus and struck roots,
but they're just, you just don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: roots on your cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I had to break it apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there are some roots where,
you know, why aren't they showing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, on the later half, you got to
encourage the roots to search for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So increase your dry backs, reduce your
humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you could kind of use
those three stages of rooting to help dial
[SPEAKER_00]: in your whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moisture content is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The initial soaking, I want to dig a
little bit deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the root riot plugs,
some people will, will soak them prior or
[SPEAKER_01]: the rock will they'll soak it prior.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned kind of squeezing
it out and how do people die?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I want to wrap pH into this
because some people will make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: water is a certain pH that they're soaking
that cube into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: With pH, you want to start a little bit
lower than general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're feeding your, your plants
normally about 6.0 pH and some cocoa or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you're going to start a few
points below that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about five, eight or so, if you're in
Rockwell, it's kind of the only one that
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to go even lower than that,
about five, six, even five, five,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for that initial soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's even recommended on the,
on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rockwell, because it starts a little
bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else you just want to be about
five, seven, five, eight, just to
[SPEAKER_00]: encourage that, that, that acid in the
rooting hormone and everything to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help the whole process, you know,
strike roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as saturation goes, I don't like
squeezing the, the cubes for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you squeeze a cube, and I squeeze a
cube, it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third person squeezes a cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be different again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need consistency when it comes to
producing clones on a mass, on a mass
[SPEAKER_00]: scale, especially commercially,
you need consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's paramount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having someone do something manually
eliminates that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can't, three people can't do the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the, the manufacturers
create this product that could hold so
[SPEAKER_00]: much moisture, but it can't hold anything
more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I like to just saturate it
completely, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the moisture that it carries on
to about halfway through the rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it, you don't need to re saturate
that media or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just give it a full saturation with
the right levels of nutrients and root
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what will carry you through the
first two stages of rooting and then get
[SPEAKER_00]: you into a feeding and drying back on the
second half of the rooting stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What nutrients are they as recommended for
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So traditionally, you know, previously for
years, everybody fed your, your fed their
[SPEAKER_00]: clones of very little food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking 0.5 EC, very, very,
very little food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they're the mindset was these are
babies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't handle a lot of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to give them very little food and
the results that they would get were
[SPEAKER_00]: stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would need a week to bounce back
after the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating a deficient plant
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as nutrients go, my rule of
thumb is to feed what the mother plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut from what's being fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to change it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you want the same type of growth
that you were getting from that mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and that growth was hitting all your
check marks, you want the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're going to put that back in the
veg and create another plant that looks
[SPEAKER_00]: just like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you change the food up, well,
now this plant has to get used to
[SPEAKER_00]: something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it doesn't have everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's slowing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my rule of thumb is whatever the mother
plants being fed for the initial soak,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's 50%, half of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get it into that regimen that it
was being fed previously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you'll get the,
get your clones to look just like the day
[SPEAKER_00]: they were cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another part of the yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pieces, you want your clones to look
just like the day they were cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to mimic that same type of food
and environment to get it to, to that
[SPEAKER_00]: point in 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that temperature,
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly have an impact on rooting
as well.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the ideal temperature and relative
humidity for the cloning process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start with the mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be about 78 to 80 degrees
and about 65% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nice breezy, warm summer day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want, I like to harden my clones off
to that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could clone in your mother room,
that's ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't always need a separate
room with all this extra humidity and a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole new environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use the same environment that
the plants came from, because when you put
[SPEAKER_00]: that dome on, it's going to increase your
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to increase your temperature
and you're playing, you're adjusting this
[SPEAKER_00]: microclimate within this dome in order to
encourage, you know, all these stages of
[SPEAKER_00]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then once they're fully done,
they've been acclimated to the same
[SPEAKER_00]: environment that they came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is ideal environment for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you know, if you're a commercial
producer and you're sending it off to
[SPEAKER_00]: another grower, well, it's been acclimated
to a perfect, um, veg environment that
[SPEAKER_00]: could go into any other veg environment
and thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need to have a big swing of
humidity, anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high seventies, 78, 80 and 65%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the environment will, will be perfect
for your, for your trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then CO2, something that isn't talked
about too much when it comes to cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I know there are some concerns from
people using domes in particular that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to deplete the CO2 within
the dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any, can you give me some
thoughts on that and maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: suggestions on how often they should be
opening up the dome or opening up the
[SPEAKER_01]: slots in the zone, the dome for aeration
purposes?
[SPEAKER_00]: For, for CO2, um, you know, I've never
really been concerned about the internal
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 levels in the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, feeding CO2 to the mother
plant and the mother stock, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to match the PAR levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, you know, running some,
you know, 630 watt CMHs, it'll give you
[SPEAKER_00]: about five to 600, depending on the height
or the canopy level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you want to kind of want to match
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about 600 PPM as well as CO2,
nothing too intense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your humidity, if your temperatures and
stuff go up or your light intensity goes
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you could, you can increase your CO2
as well for those mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as the domes go in that little
environment, I never like to, and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I used to do this, I used to,
you know, keep the little vents closed the
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple of days and you know,
always do trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that's not a best practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never want to close that dome 100% um,
because I, I've put meters inside these
[SPEAKER_00]: domes to really read the internal
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with cracking the dome, you saw plenty
of humidity, um, that the plant needs are
[SPEAKER_00]: in early stages and yet you're not
suffocating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trapping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a little bit of,
of, of air flow and if any excess hot air
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to rise, it has somewhere to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to keep my, my vents
closed at all for any period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not something I encourage or
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned, I live in currently live
in Las Vegas and it gets super dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 26% is what I'm seeing right now on my
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now when I go to clone, I do use the
domes to increase that humidity in that
[SPEAKER_01]: gross space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I do have those vents open,
it like gets rid of everything and my
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say is like the lowest
humidity that you can successfully get
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting to happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel you as far as the dry,
the dry weather goes, I'm down in Palm
[SPEAKER_00]: Springs and we're, we're, you know,
10, 20% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my sinuses feel it all the time
and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, if you're in an
environment that the, that the mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are in, you know, you got some
humidity there, but within the dome,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a full canopy within the dome,
those plants will transpire, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: with the moisture as well in the cubes
that will transpire and give you enough
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity to, to fill up your, your dome
worth of humidity without having to spray
[SPEAKER_00]: the dome or, you know, be able to crack
the, the domes and still hold humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're, and then when I say open,
I don't mean all the way initially,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just, you know, quarter the way,
just make sure it's not 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're still losing all of your
humidity, I would look at how much,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, how many, how much plant material you
have in your tray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a full tray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it half a tray?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if it's a full tray in a fully
saturated slab and the vents are cracked
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly, you should hold, you should
create enough moisture within that dome,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, to, to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would just say, you know,
fill up your tray as much as you can with
[SPEAKER_00]: as much plant material and that should
help you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have to close your dome,
the dome's 100% because it's just not
[SPEAKER_00]: holding, um, not, you don't want to keep
it closed for more than 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to still exchange that air,
burp the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let those plants breathe and
get some fresh oxygen, get some fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, CO2 and, and get rid of the stagnant
and stale, uh, condensation and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: that's being built up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lighting for clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some common misconceptions
about lighting for clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to hear your thoughts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do the clones need light,
how much light, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to keep them on a 24 hour
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you can do 18, six,
like, like you do your normal veg plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I don't like about that is during
those six hours, you've just changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: internal parameters of your dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've increased humidity, you've reduced
temperature because you're not getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of ambient temperature from the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you're, you're changing your
parameters within your dome for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a third of the day, um,
throughout, throughout the entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for lighting, keep the lights on 24
hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendation and four foot,
um, you know, LEDs or, or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lights, you know, a couple of them on
a four by two tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could house four trays on there,
six to eight inches above the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that should be enough light to
create the environment you want within the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the domes come off,
they could still veg underneath their
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, still intense enough to,
to get some vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they have to sit for the weekend or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for lighting, you could go as,
as easy as something off of Amazon four
[SPEAKER_00]: foot LEDs and, you know, start there or
you go, uh, get some Lux LED, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: four foot lights as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't personally like like the
purple, um, lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried them and I just didn't get the
same growth that I wanted out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so a cool blue spectrum is,
is what I prefer versus like a deep red or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some of the problems that
can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple stems, red stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about that in the beginning of
the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's circle back and get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do purple red stems mean and how do
you get them back to green?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if, if they started green and
they went to purple, you didn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: you didn't feed strong enough in your
rooting stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your mother plants were purple to
begin with, you're not feeding strong
[SPEAKER_00]: enough there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just an extrapolate that problem
in the rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in theory, if your plants
are green to begin with and they turn
[SPEAKER_00]: purple, um, in your rooting stage,
yeah, you gotta adjust what you're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're saturating your trays
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more than likely, you gotta,
you gotta match what that plant previously
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should, that should address your
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there's some purple strains that
are just, you know, genetically a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: purple stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I said, if they start
purple and that still met all of your
[SPEAKER_00]: other, uh, you know, parameters,
as far as just being a healthy plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's just, you know, a purple stem
genetic, and it shouldn't be anything to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's, it's usually just a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you're also getting like yellow
growth on your new, new, newly developed
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves, like stunted yellow growth,
that's usually micronutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: usually iron, um, and zinc and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, up your Cal Mag,
Cal Mag, Cal Mag, Cal Mag, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, up those micronutrients and it should
address that, that stunted, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: growth as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, cause purple stem,
you're more than likely going to also have
[SPEAKER_00]: the stunted growth as well up top that,
that short inner node space that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, underdeveloped leave and, um,
you know, the yellowing and in your,
[SPEAKER_00]: in your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're usually go hand in hand,
which just means that these plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are hungry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're, you're, you're babying them too
much up the light, up the food and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get them to get that root zone to
start up, taking all those nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it a little bit of time and it'll
bounce right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people don't know that
the Cal Mag does often, I can't speak for
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them, but there are a lot of Cal
Mag formulas that include iron,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, includes some of the
macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that those could
potentially be, I'm sorry, micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those could potentially be the cause
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, when you mentioned Cal Mag,
that's, uh, just want to mention that
[SPEAKER_01]: point as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is, I was trying to think of it when
I was speaking, but it slipped my mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have that iron and, and,
um, we'll definitely address all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, should, should get rid of
your purple stems and your yellow growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you, you shouldn't accept really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, if your plant stock to
begin with was healthy and green and
[SPEAKER_00]: getting everything that needs,
you really shouldn't accept the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: you plan to turn it purple or you yellow
in the rooting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some common mistakes that growers
make when cloning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some common mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, uh, they just kind of let it cook,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, ah, you know, close the domes
up, let that humidity increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just want to, they want to give
it too much humidity on their own by
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying the domes, keeping them closed,
you know, I'm not touching them for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for days on end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, they, they assume that this
plant needs a hundred percent humidity for
[SPEAKER_00]: five days straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's a huge mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start getting all of the pathogen
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get stem rot, you have your leaves
falling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you start to acclimate them
to, you know, your normal reduced humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you're going to get a bunch
of stressed out plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your leaves are going to curl up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to be, it's not going
to like the big shock in humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's, that's a big issue
that, that most growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to reduce my humidity gradually
and that started too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, never a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we acclimate it down to that,
uh, you know, mother room environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: that 60, 65% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with those, um,
at a certain stage daily burps,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're removing that dome, you're
wiping off the excess humidity and you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting that dome back on and that
shouldn't be more than, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15, 30 seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're taking your domes off for
minutes on end, especially in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: few days, it's another big mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, there's just, they haven't
developed the root zone to hold that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture, drink that moisture up yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earlier on you want to take off your
domes for very small amount of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you still need to burp those domes and
get rid of the excess moisture from your
[SPEAKER_00]: domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, you can leave them off for a
little bit longer because they've already
[SPEAKER_00]: got some roots and they're really being
acclimated a bit more to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just, uh, you know, don't give them
too much moisture in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just let it, let the plants breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let the plants breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if clones aren't rooting, what are some
of the things that growers should look for
[SPEAKER_00]: or do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, you gotta take a step back and
look at your environment first,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, trust, but verify all your
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you could even get small sensors that
go inside the domes and really see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening within your dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, look at your, your, your temperature,
your saturation, of your media as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: your procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you gotta really look at everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too many aspects to cloning,
but the aspects that are there are very
[SPEAKER_00]: critical and you have to be consistent
with every step.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're getting inconsistent results
and you have a team of three, four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: people cutting plugin, you should really
go one on one with them and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: and watch and observe and see if they're
really following all the SOPs or if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's taking a shortcut or someone
that have some plants out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: during lunchtime for just too much time
and all these little things that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: come into mind when managing a team,
uh, you know, in a nursery, the cross
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination problem that you spoke about
before is something that can really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really do some damage, you know,
especially when you're working on one of
[SPEAKER_01]: these commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen pictures where a person
uses same pair of scissors, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of a sudden they cut clones for a
thousand plants and those thousand plants
[SPEAKER_01]: had a virus or a viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they look like complete crap and
that's a lot of plants to mess up,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking at thousands of
plants, hundreds of plants, or thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of plants, it could do some serious
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're talking about cross contamination
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had something on your Instagram,
which I wanted to bring up here,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is you have a solution, uh,
particularly for the hormone gels to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about that solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so tradition traditionally,
uh, when, when plugging clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: most people have always gotten a shot
glass filled out up with a rooting gel and
[SPEAKER_00]: had that, uh, you know, by their side as
they're grabbing the stem, dipping it into
[SPEAKER_00]: the shot glass with gel and plugging it
into your tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that's doing is creating one,
one central point for all of your stems to
[SPEAKER_00]: cross contaminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, if there's any issues with one
plant, it's being cross contaminated
[SPEAKER_00]: against everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, taking a step back,
just, just kind of getting creative and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, you know, what could be the solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem is they're sharing that same cup,
that same gel, and you got multiple mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we still need gel on the stems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, we can't share them,
but, uh, you know, just in, in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in racking my brain and brainstorm a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with a solution that I'd put the
gel inside of a ketchup bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: a squeeze ketchup bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the, the cells in the trays
have a pre-made holes for your stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that fit perfectly for the squeeze
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just give it a little squeeze and I
am filling up the, the cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cube holes, the stem holes with the
gel versus sharing a cup and dipping
[SPEAKER_00]: everything individually in that shared
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that stem doesn't share anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes right into its own cube with its
own gel and doesn't share anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you repeat the process and all of a
sudden you're not sharing the gel anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's critical for when like,
you know, you have an issue or you,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're, you're suspected of
having a viral issue or anything that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really transferable physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which that gel will just house all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that ketchup bottle tech, whatever,
you know, whatever we want to call it
[SPEAKER_00]: here, it's, it's, uh, it works and it's
enough to like create, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, a new solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that may trigger a
different solution or something else in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future, but for now it solves a
problem as far as sharing that cup of gel,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It solves that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really cool solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you shared that with us today
because, uh, the first time I've ever seen
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, you know, you'd always pour
fresh, and you never reuse, you never pour
[SPEAKER_00]: back into the bottle was like,
Hey, I'm doing good, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm not reusing gel and stuff,
but it's like, you had a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're in a facility and stuff,
you have to get creative and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be cost efficient too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a squeeze ketchup bottle on Amazon
is a couple bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and, and as far as time goes,
you know, I was talking to the staff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I previously managed and it was,
it was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't too much of a burden on them as
far as procedures go, time goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: labor goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quick step.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing 50 squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze, and squeeze, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple minutes later, boom, they're
rocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it saves them, saves them a bit of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite honestly, it's, it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause once you, uh, once that,
that cup of gel gets used a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of, you know, stems are coming
from liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a little bit of liquid
on the bottom of the stems that goes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the gel and that doesn't allow the gel to
cling onto your stem very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to put more gel that's drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it clings to your stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that solves that problem as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause once you're bringing a little bit of
moisture into this gel cup, the
[SPEAKER_00]: effectiveness of that gel clinging to your
stem is like almost nil cleaner,
[SPEAKER_01]: faster, safer, cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, and some people were like,
Oh, you know, it looks like you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: too much gel and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, that's, that's an easy adjustment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you pour an eye pour, you know,
into the same thing, we may be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit different, but that's an easy
adjustment you can make for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits you gain that we just described.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely gonna have to buy a ketchup
bottle or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of getting towards the end of the
podcast here, we went over a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of good tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Instagram, I try to be active on there
as, uh, as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a clone coach on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my YouTube channel is barely getting
its, it's wheels moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm learning how to do all this video
recording, editing, you know, script
[SPEAKER_00]: writing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a lot to take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, it's something that I have on my
agenda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on YouTube, a clone coach as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, so I offer a rooting
program and clone coaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in the nursery end of things
from a commercial scale, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cutting, plugging and selling
clones since 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I understand the managing aspect,
the production aspect, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the market aspect and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that clone coach program
will get you the best clones ever in 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in the future, uh, for the
licensed California market, I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery marketplace in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that, that should be coming up
fairly soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will be excited to, uh, to reach
back out and talk a bit more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really cool that you offer
one-on-one consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on your website and saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people don't offer that,
but that's really cool that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody who is tuning into this is
looking for consulting, definitely check
[SPEAKER_01]: out his website and you can sign up for
that.
