[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 128.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Matthew
Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an IPM specialist and has been on
the podcast once before, episode 48,
[SPEAKER_00]: where he talked about the top 10 garden
pests and how to combat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to have him back on the podcast
so we can get deeper into pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he reveals some of the
best ways to prevent and eliminate pests.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm joined with Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time we talked about pests,
some of the common pests, what they are
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to combat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just loaded with information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have so much knowledge when it
comes to pests in particular, and you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got other areas of knowledge as well,
which I'm hoping we're going to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, welcome back to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to have you back on once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you introduce yourself for those that
didn't catch the first episode we did
[SPEAKER_00]: together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Matthew Gates.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an integrated pest management
specialist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a holistic approach to pest
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to consider many different kinds of
factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder of Zenthanol Consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a professional consultant with regards
to IPM and pest management advisory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with all kinds of people at
commercial level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also for private as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to talk about all echelons
of pest management from the strategic to
[SPEAKER_01]: the lower level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we actually had the chance to meet in
person pretty recently over at the Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Life Summit in Pahrump, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, awesome event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had a talk there actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a great talk, which I watched the
replay on it on the Grassroots website.
[SPEAKER_00]: But great, great job there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm excited to get into this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worked hard on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to warn you, some of the folks that
I have listening to this podcast are
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners, although we do have some
intermediate and advanced as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with IPM, what is IPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also get into the Everswarm
concept, which is something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually learned from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this Everswarm concept is an idea that
I've kind of come up with, although to be
[SPEAKER_01]: honest, it's not like super unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a way of rethinking certain
aspects of like ecology and biology and in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular through the funnel of how can
we as cultivators most sustainably or most
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently tackle the issue of pests,
especially as they move between continents
[SPEAKER_01]: and are always constantly evolving and
adapting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about being able to disrupt the
sort of system and preferably ideally
[SPEAKER_01]: using many different kinds of pathways to
that objective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ways that will like so you don't have
chemical resistance, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we've seen agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the common example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pests can get resistant to things like
bio controls to microbial bio controls,
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and fungi and that kind of thing,
or even viruses that are used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we if you understand like a greater
sort of ecological theory, then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why certain techniques do or
don't work and which ones are most
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant and what's the most practical
thing a lot of this is really sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: high, high level stuff, but it can be
broken down into the mechanisms of
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction between plants and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And IPM essentially is all about doing
that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a concept, obviously, a lot of
these concepts are sometimes even ancient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, IPM has been
around since like the 1950s or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this idea of integrating
different management practices for pests
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's evolved over time, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has a lot to do with like preventing pests
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these things you're actually
doing before pests are visible,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before pests are even there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a IPM routine that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I can't say that I'm super
strict on it, but there are some things
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do in my garden, indoor garden in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly grow indoors, although I do have
a vegetable garden outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some things that I do in
order to try to prevent pests from
[SPEAKER_00]: invading my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to kind of go over some of my
IPM methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: My routine, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these things that we're about
to go through, I don't do on every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some I do do on every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to kind of get your feedback on
some of these things and kind of get some
[SPEAKER_00]: more details on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I think pretty
straightforward is scouting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say, oh, yeah,
scout plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do it every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, oh, you don't need
to do that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every week or so you want to look at
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that's not frequently
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly get an infestation and
have pests take over your grow space in a
[SPEAKER_00]: faster period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to have them frequently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as far as scouting pests,
what's your opinion on how often to scout
[SPEAKER_00]: and also where to go, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking at the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking at the bottom part of the
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: We look on the top part of the plant,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, I think IPM and crop
scouting in general, whether you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it in like one single tent or a large
field or however your context is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always going to be context dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're at also matters a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you kind of say here, like sometimes
you can get away with not doing it every
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's context is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to find the right plan for
your particular scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yes, generally speaking, crop scouting
is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I think the foundation because if you
don't know what's going on in various
[SPEAKER_01]: ways, you won't be able to make an
informed decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these pests can be pretty
difficult to see or are invisible to see
[SPEAKER_01]: when they start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the germination of powdery mildew on
leaves, for example, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 100 plus hours before you're
going to even possibly see like the mildew
[SPEAKER_01]: grow or something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're looking, you want to look
at various parts of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it's in flower, look at the
flower, look at the leaves, look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: stems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look under side leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times insects and mites will like
be on underside leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, look also at the roots if you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can sometimes it's harder to
do that depending on your context,
[SPEAKER_01]: but look at every aspect of the plant and
also you know, if you can incorporate
[SPEAKER_01]: other kinds of sensors besides the mark
one eyeball, you know, there's other
[SPEAKER_01]: things out there that people use to give
them a better idea about what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: in their local environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of those common things is
using one of those handheld microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're like a 10x or a 30x
microscope in order to kind of see things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you mentioned can't really see
everything with the naked eye,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like having a hand scope in there
can be beneficial to see some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: really microscopic pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now yellow stickies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing I wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I use really not as
something to eliminate pests, but to
[SPEAKER_00]: identify that the pests are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally have yellow sticky traps
kind of stuck into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You usually have one in each pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may say that's an overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others say, no, that's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people use the yellow stickies
and they put them by the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have one hanging up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on yellow stickies and
how to use them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said in the beginning,
there are glue traps, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can use that might be more about
killing a large amount if you get a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of flies or other kinds of flying bugs
around, like thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, yellow glue traps
are not for disposing of the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is about sampling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that if you're in a small
tent, a lot of times in commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: settings, like a standard sized card might
be used per greenhouse or for a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: section than you might normally typically
see in a smaller tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe one is good enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting one in every single one though,
I think that's just a matter of how many
[SPEAKER_01]: are you getting in a pack and how often
are you replacing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically I advise people to replace in a
commercial setting every week if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: the labor and the capabilities to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think from a homegrown perspective,
that's also true as well, no matter what
[SPEAKER_01]: plants you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you take it off every week,
you put a new one in and then you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what was in the old one and you take note,
you might see things like parasitoid
[SPEAKER_01]: wasps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might see things like flies or even
like a housefly or something that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: is not a pest, but it was around in your
house or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being able to discern the difference
between different things is very crucial
[SPEAKER_01]: for making it most maximal in the way that
you deploy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good points there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing that I like to do is
avoid going directly from my outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: garden immediately to my indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people say that's an
overkill, but others swear that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly bring in pests from the outside
into your indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm often taking off my clothes,
changing my clothes between my outdoor and
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that's a good practice to do
or is that kind of an overkill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't say it's a bad practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's totally valid, especially
because like in different seasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like in winter time,
maybe you might feel a little bit safer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because there might be less
things out and about whereas like during
[SPEAKER_01]: spring and summertime, you know,
I will be walking and I'll be like hiking
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll see like an aphid or something,
you know, blow onto like my shirt or
[SPEAKER_01]: jacket or somebody else's shirt or their
hair or something like it does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you might not realize it,
but it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would also say that like in a
similar vein, if you get like fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: produce, you should check that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that there are different pests
that can get into produce like thrips in
[SPEAKER_01]: berries like raspberries and blackberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely see that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people are wondering, they might
even treat a thrips problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they come back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how did this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's by that's your biosecurity
procedure taking effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that changing your clothing
before entering a grow space is certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: valid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even think of bringing it in on
your produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up on the list, I have diatomaceous
earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that's commonly used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we kind of talked about this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched upon in our last episode,
but I wanted to bring it back up because
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I've done in the past,
I don't do it every grow, but I've done in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past where I sprinkle some
diatomaceous earth on the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from what you hear through the
grapevine is that it really helps prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: things like fungus gnats helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apparently it's like glass shards.
[SPEAKER_00]: To them and it's really hard for them to
kind of be on top of the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it destroys their
exoskeleton or what, but I know in our
[SPEAKER_00]: past episode you had mentioned that you
had some concerns about the effectiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: of diatomaceous earth using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on diatomaceous
earth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it still kind of something where the
effectiveness is questionable or is this
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's kind of proven to be
helpful in preventing pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean diatomaceous earth has its
place for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like when you apply it on soil,
when it gets moist, it's not effective
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since substrates are usually getting
irrigated, that kind of hampers its
[SPEAKER_01]: effectiveness in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, despite saying that and
despite also mentioning that I've read a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of research about using them,
especially for fungus gnats in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: apparently it was not found to be very
efficacious, but people report it being
[SPEAKER_01]: effective for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wonder if there's something going on
with certain pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when people say pests,
that's kind of broad, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: specific kinds of pests might be totally
unaffected, whereas others might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, how are you evaluating that I think
is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people just apply it and they just
don't get any pests because they just
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't there, you can't really attribute
that to having like a resistant effect,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think also people should pay
attention to how they're evaluating
[SPEAKER_01]: different products in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I would use it would be like on a
hard surface that's not typically getting
[SPEAKER_01]: moist or hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using that as like a physical
barrier, because you're right,
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens is that the the diatoms that
are harvested in the ocean, they have
[SPEAKER_01]: these silicate bodies and they crush them
up into like, basically glass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the insect cuticle, which is like
a armored, you know, body, there's little
[SPEAKER_01]: joints, and the shards can get into them
and they can cause a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like getting all cut up by
glass shards while you're in a suit of
[SPEAKER_01]: armor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a pleasant situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you said hard surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you give kind of examples on what
you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a floor perhaps, like maybe like
outside the yeah, like at the threshold
[SPEAKER_01]: between like a door of like two rooms or
something if if it's simply not getting
[SPEAKER_01]: like really maybe on the outside
potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's how people use for like home
pests like ants and and that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about sprays next.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will use sprays as a
preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to rotate my spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do like neem oil one week and
the next week to peppermint spray the next
[SPEAKER_00]: week to a rosemary spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used products like mammoth can
control, which is for my understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's time oil and a corn oil,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also the amazing Dr.
Zimes, which is a product I've used and
[SPEAKER_00]: been very, very helpful for not just pest
prevention, but also like eliminating
[SPEAKER_00]: pests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us your overall thoughts on
those type of products I mentioned and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the rotating maybe some best
practices on rotating them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I would say that like I think
that your context really dictates whether
[SPEAKER_01]: I would personally use it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you have a situation where
you typically get a lot of pests,
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of constantly like a low
pressure, but still present, like thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: are really famous for this kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can keep the population from
getting high, but you're constantly having
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you know that they're coming around
like late spring and summer, then maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you start applying this previously before
you have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't have like this
population increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could go at like a weekly rate or a
bi-weekly rate of some sort of like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a pyrethrin product, for example,
or maybe as a diractin or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg, but you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very hesitant about using things
in flour, not necessarily because,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a product might be non-toxic or
might volatize quickly or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: this, where you don't have residual.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you might still like disrupt the
trichomes or other sorts of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a quality control issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some cases it might matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases I would not necessarily go
that route.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rotating the sprays on like a weekly
basis, for example, is that effective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say, cause I think you touched
upon this in the beginning of the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like pests can kind of get used
to it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're spraying neem every single
week, they can get used to it and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not really doing anything to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rotating around peppermint is a common
one that you hear about using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosemary, those three in particular,
I used to rotate around every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that could be effective for
the average home grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a different spray that you would
add in or replace?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that, so like the products
that you're talking about, they work kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of broadly against a lot of different like
insect and mite pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if those are the things you're
concerned with, then yeah, that could be
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I would say that typically I
think from that ever swarm concept we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about, if you want to disrupt a
system, you want to have redundancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can mean greater costs sometimes
because you have different products being
[SPEAKER_01]: applied that kind of do similar things or
do them in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might seem too redundant,
but actually it's helpful for resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when you're applying these products,
like you don't know what pests you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to encounter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an insecticidal agent is not going
to affect like a fungus, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, when you're rotating a lot,
that's I think going to be based on when
[SPEAKER_01]: you normally encounter these pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like maybe in autumn and winter,
perhaps you get more fungal problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it rains a lot more where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might start applying like a
potassium bicarbonate product,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to have like a pH effect on
the foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has negative effects against like
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you might follow that up with like an
oil product or something that also harms
[SPEAKER_01]: the spores and also kills the fungi in a
different way, just as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one I want to talk about here on
my IPM routine, things that I've used in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past for IPM, maybe not every grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I've used this particular
product as well in order to battle fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats, which is mosquito bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know there's mosquito bits,
there's mosquito dunks, there's a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: different products, but it's all
essentially the same thing, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: type of bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: BT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about BT?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it, what it actually does in
regards to pest elimination and or pest
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So BT stands for Bacillus thuringiensis,
and it is a species of bacteria with
[SPEAKER_01]: various strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have different ones out there that
are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some like Israelensis are used against
flies and fly larvae, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Crestocki and Aizawi, for example,
are used against caterpillars typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you use the wrong strain,
it will usually not have very much of an
[SPEAKER_01]: effect at all against the misapplied
target.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how these work is essentially that
these different strains, they produce
[SPEAKER_01]: various proteins like cry proteins,
for example, for caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those, they all are toxic for the
caterpillar or the fly larva.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets into their gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives them sepsis and they die very
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a great way to go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are sometimes concerned because
they think that maybe the BT would be
[SPEAKER_01]: harmful for themselves, but it's actually
very, very narrow in what they affect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can affect us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also they require a alkaline gut,
which caterpillars, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: have to damage them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have that kind of gut anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was pretty effective in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the better things to use
against things like budworm moths,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is that the organism has to
come into contact with enough of the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper goals that you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually that does require them to be
feeding at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're in this situation where you have
to apply it and you have to apply it early
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to apply it before the first
sign of like budworms, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: or fungus net larvae or something like
that to have the best effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you overdo it with BT,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like adding it to the soil,
we always hear about having a balance to
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're continuing to add this end
over and over and over again, this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular species, well, can this
dominate and kind of throw things off in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to the balance of the soil food
web?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although other microbes, maybe this
would be more true for BT, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: so much because it's kind of an obligate
or maybe a facultative parasite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other bacteria and fungi in the
phytoplane and the rhizoplane and the
[SPEAKER_01]: foliage surface and the root surface,
I think you'd probably want maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: different kind of bacteria or fungus,
where you'd consider something different
[SPEAKER_01]: that would have that kind of disruptive
effect potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, I have a viewer question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually a viewer from our last
episode he commented, and he wanted to get
[SPEAKER_00]: your thoughts on a few things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, how do you feel about
pyrethrin and spinosad for IPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both are entirely organic and are approved
for use on medicinal plants, and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: both some of the well-tested products for
IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what are your thoughts on binaria
baciana, a fungus that attacks pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think pyrethrin and spinosans,
which make up spinosad, those are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also, I would call, pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like compared to other products,
people learn about systemic compounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't be using them in medicinal
plants and potentially other plants too,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they get into the nectaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neonectinoids do this sometimes or a lot
of the time, and then insects like honey
[SPEAKER_01]: bees come in or native pollinators,
they come in, they feed on it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: die, and that's not great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really consider those sorts of products
when you're applying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like to use pyrethrin because
pyrethrins, they volatize really quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: and they decay in the presence of water
and sunlight, which you get a lot in
[SPEAKER_01]: various kinds of situations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So pyrethrin doesn't stay as a residual,
which is nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as sort of other products,
I do like buveria baciana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can not really overdo it for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically kind of expensive though,
so you're probably not going to be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a broad spectrum entomopathogenic
fungus, which basically means that it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus that can feed on various kinds of
mainly insects like thrips, even aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use a lot against root aphids,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I have a lot of applications for
buveria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's different strains of buveria
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also isera fumisaurica is another
fungus that you can maybe use in lieu of
[SPEAKER_01]: buveria if you can't get buveria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there any sprays, whether it be
those or any other sprays out there that
[SPEAKER_00]: are safe to use in the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not somebody who can say
that like some of these products have been
[SPEAKER_01]: tested because unfortunately there's not a
lot of the research that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: normally rely on if I want to be
intellectually honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, for example,
like the BT I had mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel pretty comfortable with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, the pyrethrin feels pretty
comfortable, although I'm very hesitant to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it past like the very beginning of
flower, just primarily because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like how, for one thing, when you get
these products, the pyrethrin product
[SPEAKER_01]: itself might be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might volatize very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't know what other products are
being used like inertly in products that
[SPEAKER_01]: you buy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if you could just snap your
fingers and just apply pyrethrin,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy a commercial product,
like one time I had an example where I was
[SPEAKER_01]: working with a client.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had been buying a pyrethrin product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then one day they get one that has an
enhancer called pipernolbutoxide,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you're not supposed to use or you
weren't supposed to use at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they didn't know how this happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tested it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked to the supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know how it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just has given me pause ever since
experiences like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't just think that just because the
label says one thing, sometimes there's
[SPEAKER_01]: weird batches and things like that to
consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about jidam wedding agent?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of people using that as
like a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody actually mentioned that it
was safe to spray in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Disagree with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what are your overall thoughts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't have a lot of experience
with jidam, but I do talk to a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people who do use it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I don't have a very
informed opinion on it, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as using it like in veg and
something like that, I'm not really
[SPEAKER_01]: against it necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in flower, I'm not sure as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's pretty much all that I've
done in the past as regard as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative for IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there any other IPM methods that
I should consider adding to my routine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got good crop scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might, for example, entertain the
use of how big is your area?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working in a 13 by 13 room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I would say that you could
consider maybe if you want to splurge,
[SPEAKER_01]: like there's different echelons to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to splurge, you might be able
to get some of these highfalutin cameras
[SPEAKER_01]: that they got out there that are like AI.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people using those.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a product I saw recently where it
flies around on like cables, like very
[SPEAKER_01]: thin cables, and it takes pictures of your
canopy and uses AI to kind of look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: different spectra of the foliage and check
for different changes in growth and that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's really mostly speculative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing you could do on one
extreme angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if you have more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that you could do,
though, is you could consider adding a
[SPEAKER_01]: plan of various pests that you normally
encounter, and even just tracking when you
[SPEAKER_01]: encounter them during the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you've got sort of a regularity,
you then might look and see if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: products that you could add like an
additional mode of action to, or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: attack a certain life stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, ideally, if you've got
like a fungus net, there's an egg,
[SPEAKER_01]: a larva, an adult stage, in a pupil stage
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can attack every single life stage,
and ideally with multiple modes of action,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like the ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you almost always get only
fungus nets, maybe you would spend a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of extra resources to increase
that robustness potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you might realize that that's very
expensive and what you're doing now works
[SPEAKER_01]: fine and is very efficient and economical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all context dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing that comes to mind that
people are starting to use these days and
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get your input on is UV light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's UVC light in particular is
what they're using to shine on to both the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil as well as the undersides of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that an effective solution for pest
prevention or elimination?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UV light being used as like a pesticide
also like for insects, for mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: for fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been around for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to know some Dutch growers use it
in glass houses on like a boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you would use like a boom sprayer in
a large greenhouse and they would just
[SPEAKER_01]: attach lights to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dosage is very important and also being
very safe with its use because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want those lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So UVB and UVC are detrimental to your
skin, detrimental to your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to hurt yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a famous party that happened
recently for some like NFT like monkey
[SPEAKER_01]: coins or whatever those things are and
they put UV lights that were harmful to
[SPEAKER_01]: your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: People went to the club and they reported
having like partial blindness and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you go to a party, see UV
lights, so you don't know what they used
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: My point is that you should be concerned
about the safety, but if you use it
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibly, it's highly effective and you
don't even have to dose for very long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically works because the UV
light gets through the cuticle of the
[SPEAKER_01]: insects or the fungi and it basically
disrupts their DNA and they die pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why it's really highly
effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if more people were to
implement them, it's important to know
[SPEAKER_01]: your setup and also to know the best way
of applying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in my opinion, the best way to do
that is at a level, stable range where you
[SPEAKER_01]: know how far the light is from the canopy
and you also know and you can be
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent in your dosage of how long the
lights are on for, which shouldn't be too
[SPEAKER_01]: long typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard as low as five minutes a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say 10 minutes a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that reasonable?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's even sort of long in some
cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the frequency though of the
ultraviolet radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also depends maybe even like if
you're doing it, if you're just having
[SPEAKER_01]: them on or if you're like moving them
around to get like an even spread or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for example, I know situations where
people in research have used it against
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew and botrytis and they only
need to apply it for a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know UVC light I believe also comes in
some air purification systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have one of the systems where it uses
UV light as well to help destroy,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if the viruses get caught in
the air filter or what, but I thought that
[SPEAKER_00]: was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great way to use UV too for
air filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of that biosecurity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where having like filters and just
understanding like where these organisms
[SPEAKER_01]: are coming from because people will ask
me, they're like, my plan works really
[SPEAKER_01]: well usually, but I keep getting these
problems that keep coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for people who are experienced and
kind of know what they're doing already,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually it's some sort of breakdown in
your information pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that you thought was a true is a
false basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like maybe you thought that you were
secure, but oh, there's a hole in your
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse or maybe you thought everything
was secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine, but your vents, your filter
isn't working or you don't have a filter,
[SPEAKER_01]: you forgot to replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like something is, there's a breakdown in
the reality that you thought you were
[SPEAKER_01]: existing in basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to go put on your Sherlock
Holmes cap and check around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on from IPM, let's get into some
other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want to talk about mites,
insects, maybe we can get into fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about mites and solutions to
eliminate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just kind of giving you the
microphone here and drop some knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: bombs on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the big one that most people
are dealing with, not just medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, but in general are like two spots
spider mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked about it extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: They feed on like 4,000 plus plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider mites are really good at adapting
to different plants and they can even have
[SPEAKER_01]: populations become very specific on
different species in as much as a few
[SPEAKER_01]: generations where they adapt their genes
very quickly to the host plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spider mites are very common,
but there's also a lot of solutions for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use things like wettable sulfur,
for example, that can be very helpful
[SPEAKER_01]: unless it's harsh for a particular plant
that you're applying to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always apply a little bit to see if the
plant has a phytotoxic response or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always helpful for other products
that are new that you haven't applied
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also use bio controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of using things like
persimilus mites or californicus mites or
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also like to use them preventatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's their most efficient use
case, although it does require the best
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and the use cases, knowing your
quality control, knowing your sourcing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you getting them from a tertiary
distributor or primary producer?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many are you applying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you applying too many for your
location?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you're in a smaller area and
maybe even the smallest increment of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bio control you can get is kind of
overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll have to make those choices
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be true for most bio controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites are also a big deal,
obviously in medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also in a lot of other plants too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dealt with rose Russet mite in like
eight years ago with Gerbera daisies and
[SPEAKER_01]: roses and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also costs a supplier like a
million dollars to like retrofit
[SPEAKER_01]: everything because it transfers a virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Russet mites that other people are
dealing with and other plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not necessarily the case,
but in the rose Russet mite, that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyways, the way that you deal with
them is you gotta be very preventative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually they're very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their damage is very overt though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see gnarling and curling,
then you know you're looking at something
[SPEAKER_01]: that might be a Russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other damage can look like Russet mites,
but if you see this like sort of crinkling
[SPEAKER_01]: damage, that's typically a telltale sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Broad mites are like that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you are dealing with Russet mites,
one thing to note that I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people don't realize is that Russet mites
are very specialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time you're only dealing
with specific species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if you're growing coconuts
or you're growing a medicinal plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got tomatoes and you know there's a
tomato Russet mite, the tomato Russet mite
[SPEAKER_01]: probably won't be able to feed on your
other plants, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I see people
getting confused about online a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a video on my YouTube channel
that basically talks about all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites, where they come from
evolutionarily, how they adapt the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they did and what you can do to defeat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with spider mites and a lot of these
other pests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been fortunate enough not to come
across spider mites or Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fingers crossed that that never
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna knock on wood right here and
hope that it never happens there because I
[SPEAKER_00]: heard that both of those are very tough to
combat, particularly the Russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's said to be more tough to combat than
the spider mites, but spider mites can be
[SPEAKER_00]: very difficult to combat from what I hear,
particularly when you're in flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's harder to kind of,
you know, you don't have the sprays to
[SPEAKER_00]: really fall back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they get out of control and start
webbing, it's just game over from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like they represent two ends of a
spectrum of what kind of pests you can
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the one hand, you've got spider mites,
super common, in my opinion, less
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although if you let them get out of
control, they all become very hard to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, you've got Russet
mites, which I feel like are a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: less common for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it depends on where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're much more extreme in their
damage when you get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the damage they cause is typically
like permanent afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get stunting, you get these other
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have different, maybe threat levels
for different pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into insects next.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I'd like if you could explain
the difference between mites and insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they last, they last share a common
ancestor of like over 500 million years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, even though they look kind of
similar, they're actually very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mites are like arachnids, you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like spiders and their relatives in
that group, they've got eight legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They typically have eight legs,
but like Russet mites only have four
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're, well, they've lost a lot
of genes over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch the video if you'd like to
learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mites have, they have an extensive,
you know, various, various ecological
[SPEAKER_01]: regions they've gone into.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically are in all kinds of niches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones we're dealing with are mostly
herbivorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most mites like spider mice, broad mice
and Russet mites are what you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be dealing with with medicinal plants
generally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the damage that they cause is usually
through feeding on plant cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually they can be kind of innocuous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mites are even beneficial,
like in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas insects, for example, they are
kind of, they're a smaller group for one,
[SPEAKER_01]: a taxonomic range smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's actually maybe even more
parasitic wasps and beetles than there are
[SPEAKER_01]: like basically any other organism on
earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So insects are incredibly adaptive,
highly adaptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically are shrimp that learned how
to live in not the ocean, but the air by
[SPEAKER_01]: evolving wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first animals on earth to have
winged flight, so powered flight by the,
[SPEAKER_01]: by their own wings and not by gliding and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all kinds of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that you have to deal with
typically are things like thrips and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemiterra, so like aphids and other
insects with like a piercing mouth part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got, you've got insects that have
chewing mouth parts too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, caterpillars,
which eventually become moths and
[SPEAKER_01]: butterflies, which all butterflies are
moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could go on and on, but the four biggest
groups of insects that people deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: are or that there are actually on earth
are flies, moths, beetles, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: hymenotera, which are wasps, bees,
and ants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all related.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bring these up because they're the
four biggest groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called the big four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll also notice that all of
these are insects that have the larvae,
[SPEAKER_01]: pupae, adult life stage development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now mites don't have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a different sort of life stage,
but it's basically like the earliest
[SPEAKER_01]: insects had where they just start off as a
little nymph that looks like the adult and
[SPEAKER_01]: they get bigger and bigger and bigger and
they suddenly become the adult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, that's your, that's your
evolutionary nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's great explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's helpful for not only me,
but many of my audience as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing the difference between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us a little bit more about the
big four that you mentioned as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: insects and like solutions, some solutions
in order to eliminate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big four again, flies, beetles,
wasps, bees, and ants and moths.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think caterpillars, the larval moths
are like the biggest issue that most
[SPEAKER_01]: people are dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think are the strongest one that people
encounter because there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the earth, you're probably going to
deal with some kind of caterpillar that
[SPEAKER_01]: can feed on the plant that you're dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the best way to deal with
caterpillars is to first understand that
[SPEAKER_01]: generally they're going to become,
they're going to become active in the
[SPEAKER_01]: spring and maybe late spring time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have populations
usually that were pupating either in
[SPEAKER_01]: debris or they were in soil or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, they overwinter and they
come out as adults, at least if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: a place where it winters, if you're in
tropical areas, then they're probably just
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because this first
population, they're going to be moving
[SPEAKER_01]: across your region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in the USA, maybe they start
off in like Southwest USA, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: move South, Northeast, essentially in a
Northeasterly movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the temperature increases, you get more
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with the budworm moth,
Helicoverpizaea, the corn earworm that
[SPEAKER_01]: people deal with, with medicinal plants
and really like 200 plus crops across
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start off in the spring and summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ramp up into late summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've become super active and they move
across earth or across the US from the
[SPEAKER_01]: corn belt, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a place in the USA where most
of the corn is produced, various states,
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of in the Midwest and North
Midwest area mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that place is like a powder keg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the moths will disperse from that
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: To other parts of the USA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you kind of know that there's this
rhythm that you can pay attention to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can avert it by, for example,
germinating later in the year or getting
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that germinate later in the year or
earlier in the year, some way that allows
[SPEAKER_01]: you to harvest before or after the peak
where the budworms are going to go after
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really good info there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a lot more that can be
said about mites and insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a whole episode on each one
of those topics, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's keep it brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next thing we have
here on the list, which is fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are all kinds of fungi, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that my favorite ones to talk
about are the powdery mildews and the
[SPEAKER_01]: necrotrophs, the botrytis and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to bring these up because they
represent two different pathways to
[SPEAKER_01]: colonizing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildews are what we call
biotrophs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they require a living host to feed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: One interesting thing about powdery
mildew, which you heard me talk about at
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil summit, was that powdery mildews,
if you go back far enough, they're related
[SPEAKER_01]: to fungi that broke down plant tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have the same genes that they use
to break down the cellulose in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps they evolved from these fungi
that used to break down decaying plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, and they became really good at
breaking down living plant matter instead,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they became parasites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really interesting when it
comes to the soil food web and that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of thing where what could be a beneficial
can eventually become a parasite given
[SPEAKER_01]: enough time and familiarity with the host,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildews, they are not systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think they're a systemic
pathogen, but things like botrytis are,
[SPEAKER_01]: or fusarium are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas powdery mildew only exists on the
epidermis of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only kind of like skin deep,
but they're really good at colonizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants once they've established.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see different spots colonize,
it's not because they're moving through
[SPEAKER_01]: the tissue, it's because they're
recolonizing the host.
[SPEAKER_01]: And powdery mildews are not super
detrimental to their plant host,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas things like botrytis, they get
onto the plant, they trick the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: kill itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tricks the cells to destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They destroy themselves, and they sop up
the nutrients afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're a real threat, and they can
attack different parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Botrytis, for example, is commonly
associated with the flower, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the rotting of floral tissue in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also get things like fusarium that
will attack things like the roots or the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you have plants where
everything looked fine, but then like a
[SPEAKER_01]: few days later, suddenly starts to wilt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what's going on,
you check the roots, and you see that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all kinds of like oozing,
you know, tissue and dilapidated
[SPEAKER_01]: structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because this fungus attacks the
tissue and like immediately destroys the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the roots are gone, there's
really not very much for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the stem is really damaged,
then there's not a lot of nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer, it dies very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to know these two different
kinds of fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are not a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are a huge deal, and they can
be a quick problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a plan, knowing that those
things are even possible, and then having
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you can apply beforehand,
like a microbe or a compound or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just keeping your plants hygienic
is also really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe chopping and dropping is not always
the greatest when it comes to these
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens that can be on or in the
tissues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you are going to do something like
that, like compost it, process it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then reapply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had bud rot before, you know,
when you mentioned that, it just brought
[SPEAKER_00]: up memories, bad memories, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Botrytis senera had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had indoors, the oscillating
fan died overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was just that stagnant air,
humidity rose, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up attacking four of my plants,
if I remember correctly, four of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants had botrytis in it, bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just really in the main cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are plants where I had really
huge buds, and it was really just this
[SPEAKER_00]: main cola that kind of stuck up more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was bud rot right in the middle
because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people was kind of surprised
because, you know, obviously I corrected
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was latent flowering when the fan
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I corrected the problem within,
I think, 24 to 48 hours, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But correct me if I'm wrong, that is
enough time in order for it to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: establish from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I spent two more weeks growing
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that doesn't mean that since I have
air circulation now that it's just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll continue to spread, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to harvest and then realize,
oh my gosh, I had bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must have been from when my fan died
two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wasn't fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I was able to still utilize the bottom
buds that didn't have bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people are against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, hey, you got bud rot on one part
of the plant, throw away the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are going to say,
hey, just cut off that bud that's
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the plant is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question because it is
systemic, like I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if you don't see the
colonization of the tissues itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you can't necessarily see some of
these things because they're microscopic,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that having a cautious approach
is definitely valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly you could do something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, though, I think at the very
least, not actually at a home-grow
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective when you're growing plants by
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you have produce, botrytis will
colonize the fruit tissue or the coral
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe discard the orange that has the
fungus, but maybe don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: discard the orange or the fruit that has
no signs of mycosis, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got that moldy development,
that ferocious odor, maybe cut that part
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try your luck with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's totally valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a commercial level, you might be
looking at different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be able to perceive through
testing and other things if there is other
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you don't want people to be
exposed to as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it definitely makes sense to be
cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that also one other thing I'd
like to say is that bud rot doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily only colonize the floral
tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some cases, in some plants,
it can be a foliar pathogen or even a stem
[SPEAKER_01]: or root pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wish bud rot upon anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not fun at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the feeling of going all the way to
the point where you're ready to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: and then realizing that you've got bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a feeling that I don't want
anybody to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into bacteria next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just open-ended question there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us what you know about bacteria
and what we need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, with regards to IPM and also
with regards to plant health, the most
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting thing for me is that there's
this idea that there's a fungal or
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial dominance that you might be
looking to accentuate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's not necessarily a
correct dichotomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's bacteria that are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that are detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those that even work with each
other as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get a good snapshot of the
microbes going on in the soil microbiome,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also even on the phytoplane of the
foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it helps to envision the
plant's surface as like a hostile
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got these jagged trichomes and stomata
and wax and secretions and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that without getting into too
much detail, one of the best things people
[SPEAKER_01]: can do from an IPM perspective is try to
apply some of these bacteria that have a
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogenic effect against parasites,
but not just insects and insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's mites, but also like fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's bacteria that you can apply and
even fungi as well that you can apply to
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliage and to other tissues like the
roots that will either colonize those
[SPEAKER_01]: tissues internally or just on the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will create a disruptive
environment where other microbes that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want are not able to colonize very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also combine this with so not just
microbes or bacteria that parasitize like
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi and other bacteria, but also those
that produce antimicrobial compounds and
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most important thing is to find
things that will play nicely with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot more research to
uncover, but if we take a look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: ecology of microbes and bacteria on
different kinds of plants, we can find
[SPEAKER_01]: what works maybe more generally and then
apply those to other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of research is ongoing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bacteria is super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, once I learned that 99.9% of the
bacteria we haven't even discovered yet or
[SPEAKER_00]: researched yet, it just blew my mind that
there's so much that we don't know and so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more to uncover and we won't uncover
it in our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next thing to talk about is pretty
interesting to me as well, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want to hand the microphone
over to you and just drop some knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: bombs on us in regards to viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the biggest knowledge bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was reading a report recently that
talked about the sort of evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically they talked about how it's
possible that when cellular life as we
[SPEAKER_01]: know it and even pre-cellular life as we
know it sort of developed, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: viroids, for example, are not quite
viruses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the strands of RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's thought that there was a pre-DNA
world, an RNA world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that viroids are basically like a
relict of that era of life history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And viruses though, perhaps, especially
RNA viruses, they may have been like the
[SPEAKER_01]: first things that became like what we now
think of as the nucleus of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible that as like a genetic
component, viruses are basically part of
[SPEAKER_01]: us and have been for the entire entirety
of cellular life on earth, knowledge bomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so what I'm trying to say here is that
we shouldn't be surprised that there are
[SPEAKER_01]: various kinds of viruses out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are detrimental, obviously,
but actually a lot of them are either
[SPEAKER_01]: neutral or even beneficial for their
hosts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them exist inside our genome as
retroviruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them can escape or genetic codes
that escape from other cells and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit high-minded,
but I think it shows contextually exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're dealing with here.
[SPEAKER_01]: These organisms or not organisms that are
like quasi-life and they're around and
[SPEAKER_01]: they basically work like molecular
additions, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so bringing it down to IPM though,
we have things like viroids that are a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge pain for exactly that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because things like hoplite and
viroids are basically transgenic code that
[SPEAKER_01]: our cells, or in this case, the plant
cells, they take and they go, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is plant RNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me replicate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by replicating the RNA of the viroid
and not everything else it's supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do for the cell, you get these weird
things like stunting, chlorosis,
[SPEAKER_01]: other kinds of weird damage because you
have these oddball genes that are just not
[SPEAKER_01]: being expressed in a plant, which are very
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so viruses also, they can do things
weird like you've got these recombination
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses where their genome is split up
into different chunks and they move
[SPEAKER_01]: between different plants and then
recombine with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, there's not a whole lot
of conventional solutions for viruses
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're basically genetic code and
it's very hard to target genetic code
[SPEAKER_01]: without targeting the plant's code too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, once I heard particularly about
hoplite and viroids being identified at
[SPEAKER_00]: 73% of commercial facilities in the US,
that just kind of blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that in California alone,
90% of facilities, medicinal plants tested
[SPEAKER_00]: positive for hoplite and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can only imagine the amount of people
that have hoplite and viroids in their
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and don't know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are seeing deficiencies,
seeing plant problems and trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really a viroid, which they
really can't do anything about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it comes into, it can be within the
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be transferred in water as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, the guest that's coming on this
podcast is going to talk all about hoplite
[SPEAKER_00]: and viroids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys stay tuned for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be real in depth,
all about hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to that
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is there any other viruses or viroids
besides hoplite and viroids that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: worthy of mentioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: And keeping an eye out for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to say one thing about hoplite
and viroids in particular is that it was
[SPEAKER_01]: recently found that other plants,
like we call it, we give viruses these
[SPEAKER_01]: names, typically the first host we find
them in and a symptom that they have about
[SPEAKER_01]: them, like tobacco mosaic virus,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hoplite and viroids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting though is that
hoplite and viroids has been found in
[SPEAKER_01]: things like tomato, sunflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucumber and its ability to transfer from
parent to offspring through seed and other
[SPEAKER_01]: older research was kind of low in newer
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's showing really high transmission
rates vertically from parent to offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be not just in hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in other plants too that you
might be growing in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be in other commercial plants
that are being sold right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not being tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just a thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely check out that
viroid video upcoming.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information that we
should be kept up on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other viroids though, there are stunt
viroids in other kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrus gets a viroid, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peanut, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also viroids that have been
found in the human oral microbiome or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least viroid-like things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently it came out these so-called
obelisk-like viroids that were found in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria in our own mouths and in all
the continents on Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went through and they categorized the
genetic structure of these obelisks and
[SPEAKER_01]: they found them in human samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we even have viroids in and around
ourselves too, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as our ability to sequence and look in
finer and finer detail increases,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll probably be able to find more and
more things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally though, I mean like there's some
viroids and viruses that are going around
[SPEAKER_01]: right now in tomato that are a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ring-spot virus, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, I guess another big one that
people are dealing with a lot is
[SPEAKER_01]: beet-curly-top virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's spreading all throughout various
medicinal plants in the USA and abroad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vectored by the beet leafhopper
pretty much solely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have found that viruses that are
like 95 to 98 percent the same as like
[SPEAKER_01]: BCTV we find in tomatoes and peppers in
the area, they're coming back very
[SPEAKER_01]: similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it means that these beet leafhoppers
are going into crops and they're taking up
[SPEAKER_01]: the virus and then they're moving into
medicinal crops and other plants and also
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are just living around in the
environment and they act as reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you live in these areas like
Nevada and Arizona and other places where
[SPEAKER_01]: BCTV is very common, or Colorado,
then you should be aware of that and have
[SPEAKER_01]: some plans for finding the symptoms,
which is usually like a stunting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and a curling of the leaves and
chlorosis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're suspect, you should
definitely get it tested to find out if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you know that probably you
won't be able to find a solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, and then you should use
your resources for something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good that there is some testing
out there now that you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you feel like you might have virus,
go and get it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some affordable options out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the questions I like to ask
almost on every episode towards the end is
[SPEAKER_00]: really looking for advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, we have a lot of
beginners that tune into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for beginners who
are battling pests for the first time?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the number one advice for
especially for beginners is to learn what
[SPEAKER_01]: pests you might be able to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just for your particular region,
although that's very crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find information out from
various kinds of research reports you can
[SPEAKER_01]: look up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are extension agents for various
places in the world that you can go to to
[SPEAKER_01]: find out what is a problem in your region
for the plants that you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also having a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you already know some of those pests
or you've encountered them already,
[SPEAKER_01]: then learning about not only those,
but the ones that you might have not have
[SPEAKER_01]: encountered yet is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like gold because you aren't going to
be running around panicking because you've
[SPEAKER_01]: never dealt with this problem before and
you don't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've never even looked into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just having that, it's just such a
valuable thing in adversity to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge set in the beginning before you
deal with a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the number one advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us how can listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?

[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically all you need to know about
IPM, some high level theory out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also some practical applications of a
system of systems approach and a
[SPEAKER_01]: multi-domain holistic approach to pest
