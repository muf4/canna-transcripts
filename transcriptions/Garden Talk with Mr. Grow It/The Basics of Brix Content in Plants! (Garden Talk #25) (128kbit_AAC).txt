[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk, 25 episodes
deep, I want to talk about how the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: is doing and what's upcoming in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bricks in a nutshell, it's going to
improve your flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to improve your nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to improve your shelf life and
even have some IPM benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be lower at night because
again, it's sending some of those sugars
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the roots for the microbes for
exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that your bricks levels will
drop at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing methods do play a role in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's found that organic growing tends to
be a little bit more conducive.
[SPEAKER_01]: To higher bricks levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good assistant to looking at the
health of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily, you know,
the doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 episodes deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I read a stat recently that said 90% of
podcasts don't make it past episode three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of that remaining 10% of podcasts,
90% of those don't make it past episode
[SPEAKER_00]: 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at episode 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into talking about bricks
with our guest today, I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: how the podcast is doing and what's
upcoming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to thank the sponsors
who helped make this podcast possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Dutch Pro for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dutch Pro products are now available in
several countries across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
Dutch Pro is a plant fertilizer company
[SPEAKER_00]: that has base nutrients, additives and pH
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have different formulas of base
nutrients for if you're in soil or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in hydro or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also formulate their base nutrients
for if you're using hard water or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using RO or soft water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Dutch Pro's Amazon

[SPEAKER_00]: They're most known for their LED grow
lights, but they also have other products
[SPEAKER_00]: such as grow tents, in-line fans and
carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used their SF1000, SF2000 and SF4000
LED grow lights in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got some great results with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Spider Farmer's
Amazon store down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget to use coupon code
MRGROWIT5 for a discount on their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the very first episode of this
podcast, if you listen to it on one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast platforms, then you heard my
vision for the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not say what the vision was for the
podcast in the first episode on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to reiterate my vision for this
podcast right now and I'm gonna read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vision for this podcast is to talk with
growers from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: both beginners and experts, and seek to
learn more about what they know about
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna judge people for the way
that they grow and this isn't a debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm simply seeking to learn more about the
guest and what they know about gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: and how they do things in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: My vision is for these conversations to
not only help expand my knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you, the listener's knowledge too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that vision, we've done it so
far here up to episode 25.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's one thing I'd like to add is
that this podcast is for all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to narrow down the scope to
just that plant that we all know and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many grow techniques are the same or very
similar from plant to plant and I hope
[SPEAKER_00]: that incorporating all plants into this
podcast will help inspire you to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: other plants, such as vegetables,
fruits, or even host plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that all plants should be treated
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, YouTube doesn't agree with me on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's some people that are
listening that don't agree with me on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but I believe all plants should be
treated equally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that laws need to be changed
in the future in order for that to happen,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do see that happening sometime in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: May not be in my lifetime, may not be in
your lifetime, but sometime in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this podcast is for all plants,
it's a clean podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube has rules and guidelines that need
to be followed in order for the video to
[SPEAKER_00]: not get suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: No excessive swearing, no excessive use of
certain words, no smoking, no showing
[SPEAKER_00]: certain plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can follow those rules, then the
podcast will stay in good standing and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can reach more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also kind of done as a big F-U to
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll follow the rules that you put in
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep fighting the fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everyone who is understanding
on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go over some numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 24 episodes released so far have over
1.5 million views combined on YouTube and
[SPEAKER_00]: 30,000 downloads through podcast
platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You made it clear that you want this
podcast to continue, not just by those
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers, but in the comment section as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will continue to do this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top three episodes, Rob from CLTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: That episode has 235,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: The episode with Pigeon's 420 has 234,000
views.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the episode with Welcome to the Grow
10 has over 164,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is way beyond my expectations and I'm
super thankful for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I'm sure there's some of you
that don't know this, but I am part of
[SPEAKER_00]: another podcast with Rob and Pigeon's.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called From the Stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it here on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put a link down in the description
section below and it's also on podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future guests, let's talk about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am so excited to bring you some of these
guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up next week is Brian Mason,
The Soil Doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk all about soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, you'll see Guru from The Dude
Grows Show, Dude from The Dude Grows Show,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the last one I'll reveal is Mark
Boutwell from Perfect Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the next two months worth of
episodes already planned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them already filmed as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super excited for what's upcoming
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have rambled on enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I talk with Chad
Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know him from his show
called The Home Grow Show, which airs
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a month on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 12 years and he
grows a variety of plants such as
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, carrots, garlic, onions,
microgreens, medicinal plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: Swiss chard, cucumbers, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about the
importance of bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about what bricks is.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to increase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to all of you that support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to Patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now let's get into talking with
our guest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, happy to have you here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a good topic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that we really hear
much about, at least on the home growing
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my audience is kind of just like
me, home growers, indoors mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bricks isn't a topic that I really
hear about often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm glad to have you on here so you
can explain all about bricks and the
[SPEAKER_00]: importance of it and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what I do to start the podcast is
an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is Chad Westport and I've
been gardening for quite a few years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I've had a passion
for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of my background is a lot of
traditional gardening, your vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've taken a lot of this knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've moved it into kind of medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can apply that there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to kind of further that, I jumped out
of my previous life in audio engineering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did sustainable agriculture and farm
systems program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really taught me a lot of
knowledge that I feel I can use going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward in this new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great because a lot of the
things, just like bricks, bricks is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a couple hundred years old,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of things applied in
traditional agriculture that we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone full circle from starting out as
just the experimental gardener to having
[SPEAKER_01]: fun and knowing a little bit more with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know, I think I first heard about
you was from your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how new it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's somewhat new this year,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a homegrown show that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's on the weekends, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's on Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's every first and third Saturday of the
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really wanted to do there was
give everybody exposure to different
[SPEAKER_01]: styles and different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be the person to
subscribe to you have to do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I want to get out to
people because there are, there's people
[SPEAKER_01]: in different climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, different soil conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people aren't even using soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might find something that works
better for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, you can see what's smart
about the next person and apply it to your
[SPEAKER_01]: own style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is my goal with that show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have such a similar mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I say in my videos all the time
about there's so many different ways to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really comes down to personal
preference a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, oftentimes people say,
Hey, that's the wrong way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it's just an alternate way to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, but I will link Chad's show down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can click on that and tune in
on Saturdays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the topic today,
which is bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us what is bricks and why is it
important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, bricks in a nutshell, um,
it's going to improve your flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to improve your nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to improve your shelf life and
even have some IPM benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bricks is commonly associated with
sugar levels in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear a lot of it from the wine
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got to check the grapes,
the nice grapes, make the nice sweet
[SPEAKER_01]: wines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's more than just sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, bricks is really a measure of sugars,
of course, but also vitamins, minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins, and other solids inside of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar being the most abundant,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but having good bricks levels again,
uh, it's going to lead to a healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, better crops harvested at the right
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of for what we're talking about,
uh, IPM, a good, or a plant with good
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks levels is going to stand a better
chance against pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why it's pretty important
for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you, how do you measure
bricks?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bricks is something where you're going
to take like the sap or the liquid from,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, sometimes you can take it from the
fruit, uh, directly from like a grape,
[SPEAKER_01]: say, or, uh, if there is no fruit,
you can use leaf samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of crush up your leaves and
you get a little bit of the sample and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get that liquid and you put it in what is
called a refractometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the refractometers are what you use to
measure the bricks levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they come in all shapes and sizes and
price ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go, uh, anywhere from like $20 to
$200 buying a meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a lot of them, uh, you can get our
handheld, which is nice because again,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going out into the field and
you're measuring bricks levels on crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have something that you can bring with
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it right there on the spot in
the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so if I almost say it's almost kind of
like a, a little telescope with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, recorder mouthpiece on one side,
how it's kind of like hollowed out and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where you put your liquid in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get your liquid, you put it in the
refractometer and it shines a light up
[SPEAKER_01]: through the liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on, you know, doing this a
number of times, the way that the light
[SPEAKER_01]: refracts or bends through the liquid is
how they're able to tell what your bricks
[SPEAKER_01]: levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at a couple on Amazon right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a few on my wish list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been meaning to buy one of these
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't pulled the trigger yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them here is 1799.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks just exactly like you had
explained it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's one, another one,
which is $149.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some definitely a big price
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had mentioned this $149 dollar
one looks like it has like a digital
[SPEAKER_00]: readout on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you know anything about like just
the price difference, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: digital readout versus just the regular
one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it really for a home grower to
be spending $150?
[SPEAKER_00]: For a bricks refractometer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't really think that you
need to go overboard with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good assistant to looking at the
health of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily, you know,
the doctor that's looking at everything
[SPEAKER_01]: combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do say it's important, but I don't
think you need to go overboard either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like you said, there are the
digital displays, which yes, they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be more accurate than, than Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and really the point is, the moving
dial and really the levels that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it depends on how much the hands
on the dial are spread out, because if it
[SPEAKER_01]: has like a plus or minus of three for the
margin of error, that three can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: make a big difference kind of from the,
not from the bottom of the scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: but from the top of the poor section to
where the optimal section is, is really
[SPEAKER_01]: about five points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it depends on what the plus or
minus is on that readout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spending a little more is beneficial
for that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that you'll find too,
probably with the $150 versus the 17 is
[SPEAKER_01]: Bricks was measured or calculated to take
place at 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and just how the refraction of the
light works is meant to be at 68 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these will take that into
account, do the math and then show you the
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a chart online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go type in your air temperature
and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you figure out pretty quickly,
but that also is probably a differentiator
[SPEAKER_01]: of cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I'm taking measurements,
just back up, I know you briefly explained
[SPEAKER_00]: it as you're basically going to take off a
piece of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be one of the newer leafs on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're basically going to squeeze
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you use to like squeeze it and
get that sap or whatever to drip off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some, sometimes if you are breaking,
like the petioles, the stems going to the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf, you can get some sap out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also times there's, you know, depending
upon the sample size, you need a pestle
[SPEAKER_01]: and mortar kind of crush stuff up that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're doing a larger sample size in
that case.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, usually if the plant has been
hydrated recently, you're able to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: crack it off there on the stem from the
leaf and you could get a good sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the ideal bricks level
or bricks range that you want to be in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard one of the things I've learned
from Harley Smith, a shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took his master growers course last year
and he had mentioned that plants with a
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks level over 12 pests won't even
recognize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the ideal bricks level or
range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you, you've nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 is the ideal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard, you know, medicinal plants
ranging up to 15, potentially 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't verified that myself,
but 12 really is the good goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said earlier, you know,
five points distinguishes from ideal to
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the bad points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seven, when you're at seven and down,
that's when things aren't looking too
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so staying at 12 is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a study that was done,
um, where one field was treated and had
[SPEAKER_01]: high bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it came in at 12, the field next to it
didn't, and it had low bricks and there
[SPEAKER_01]: were insect pressures that came,
uh, leaf hoppers, I believe it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they totally bypassed the field with
the higher bricks went to the other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a study came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on that, that if you have 12,
you're basically invisible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that has kind of, that's been not
necessarily disputed, but it's been argued
[SPEAKER_01]: that it is, uh, not a magic number.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you, and here's the kind of
the crux of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insects and diseases like weaker plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a field of healthy plants
next to a field of unhealthy plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: insect pressure is going to go to that
unhealthy field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's kind of what happened there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't necessarily the bricks itself
that made them leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, Hey, this is an easier
target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what can folks do to increase bricks
levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Say they're in that danger zone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things that they can
do in order to increase it and get up to
[SPEAKER_00]: that 12% or above for bricks level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it all kind of starts in the
beginning with your original plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing methods do play a role in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's found that organic growing tends
to be a little bit more conducive to
[SPEAKER_01]: higher bricks levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the key components in both
cases there is just the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, a lot of times in the synthetic
based diets, um, it doesn't give the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, you know, the ideal or the conducive
environment for those microbes to grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive and do what they need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so by growing organically,
that is going to help you cause you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes are there, the fungi is
there, the organic material is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's going to kind of help
everything really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in a nutshell, there, there's also
lighting, um, DLI or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the intensity of the light that's
important too, because we know that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, proper lighting drives
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photosynthesis creates sugars in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, sugars relates backs to bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having good and proper lighting,
it's more photosynthesis, it's more sugar
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can get distributed, uh,
to different areas and for different
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it kind of, it kind of starts
with the, the, the soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, calcium is another important one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm leaving cow mag off of that
magnesium does come into the equation
[SPEAKER_01]: here, but I'm just saying calcium at this
point, um, cause calcium, it helps build
[SPEAKER_01]: stronger cell walls in the plants and you
know, that increases the movement in the
[SPEAKER_01]: xylem and phloem, the more things coming
up, uh, because sugars and bricks,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's a two way street.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the sugars and stuff are
coming up, uh, through the root zone and
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plants and the photosynthesis,
but they're also going back down the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: at night, um, to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of a symbiotic relationship there
again, that's, that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, getting the right amount of calcium in
there, uh, is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to overload it just
because, Hey, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds thick walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have amazing stocks on all my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there are antagonistic properties to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have too much calcium in
there, you're likely to log out,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, phosphorus or potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that creates a different kind of
problem because, uh, uh, diagnosing plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for me is always one of the trickier
things because is it truly a deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: you're seeing or is it a lockout situation
due to, um, you know, the ions,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cations and ions from other minerals
or just a pH problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that, that, that kind of gets,
uh, gets tricky when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: diagnose them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't put on a whole bunch of calcium
just because I said it was good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like everything there is always a
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to lock other things
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you separated calcium and magnesium
and, you know, Cal Mag, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: just, uh, say Cal Mag and they think
that's a nutrient in itself when really
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just the name of a product,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's calcium in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's magnesium in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes there's nitrogen in it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about calcium in particular,
do you have any recommendations for just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight calcium that they can give to
their plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in kind of like an organic type
method, there's a lot of different options
[SPEAKER_01]: you could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, gypsum is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, gypsum is something that doesn't
really affect the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always kind of nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is something that you're probably
going to add in, um, while you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: your mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if I were to, you know, spot like a
little deficiency or if I wanted to top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress something, um, in an organic method,
there is, uh, WCA, which is, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: something I saw from Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, I don't know if it's JADAM or,
or which farming method it came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: but essentially, uh, calcium bicarbonate,
uh, that is shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you know, egg shells,
oyster shells, crab shells, all those
[SPEAKER_01]: different ones you can use at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you essentially, um, and I believe it's
one part of egg shells to 10 parts of
[SPEAKER_01]: white vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix the two and I'm glossing over
this, of course, but you mix the two,
[SPEAKER_01]: you let it sit for about 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it extracts the calcium from the
shells and then you can pour it on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a good, uh, organic treatment
that you can use at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, for, for synthetic
growers, there's always, uh, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of bottled calcium out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, even if you are doing
synthetic, I wouldn't shy away from,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, calcium bicarbonate methods
or, uh, gypsum either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when should, uh, measurements be
taken, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I'm sure there'll be home
growers here that are going to go and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a Bricks refractometer and they're going
to be measuring, uh, taking measurements,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, should they do it every day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they do it every week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they do it at morning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they do it at night?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets little, little background on
when and how often measurements should be
[SPEAKER_00]: taken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's, that's a great question
because it does have an impact on the
[SPEAKER_01]: readings you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you want to, to start out,
you want to do it, uh, at the same time,
[SPEAKER_01]: every time you measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's going to be lower at night
because again, it's sending some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars down to the roots for the microbes,
for exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see that your Bricks levels will
drop at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you're outdoors, no, again,
with like row crops, um, if it's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, cloudy day, you'll have lower Bricks
levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, light defects can affect Bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, uh, you can do it as often
as you want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you'll glean much if you do
it on a month to month basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not terrible lot changes on a day to
day basis, but weekly I think is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could do it, you know,
maybe every four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a data freak like me and you
like plotting charts and doing all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but yeah, basically doing it once a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I prefer to do it midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best time to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you kind of alluded to,
yes, make sure you're doing it at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time every time you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it's just going to be inaccurate
for your purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you wrote a pretty extensive article
on dude grow show website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for those that are tuning in on Apple
podcasts, Spotify, you can just search
[SPEAKER_00]: Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called high science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the Bricks and explainer of Bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty long here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get into details.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we went over quite a bit here in
this talk, but there's one more thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you talked about how during
photosynthesis, chlorophyll manufacture
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it also says that humic and fulvic
acids are a great way to make iron and the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil more plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about, uh, specifically
about humic and fulvic acids and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: how this relates to bricks and how,
you know, it can increase uptake and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the humic and the fulvic acids,
they act within the soil as kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: chelators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, basically I mentioned earlier,
the ions, cations, anions, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, from like calcium will have,
and part of me for not being overly
[SPEAKER_01]: scientific here, but you, you know,
you can all picture like the oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has, you know, the bubble with a little
stem and another bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of the cations and ions,
a positive and negative term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, sometimes nutrients will see each
other bind and then they'll lock each
[SPEAKER_01]: other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the humics, the fulvics, um,
they kind of blind everything to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that also kind of relates to amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned that in the article
here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
amino acids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids are essentially the building
blocks of kind of all life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the amino acids are the building
blocks of all life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids, uh, create protein and to
create that within a plant system or the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant structure that takes sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using your sugar energy and
amino acids to build protein, then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have less sugar in there for higher bricks
and other things that you're going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by adding these amino acids,
you're really kind of not cheating the
[SPEAKER_01]: system, but you're, you're taking away
that draw of sugars or in the energy form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by adding those amino acids,
you get the protein and similar to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, the humic and fulvic acids,
um, it can act as a chelator, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically making more of the nutrients
available in the soil to the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're able to move around more freely
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's again, another very important
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the calcium is kind of building the
walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phosphorus is the truck driving
everything around and the humic or humic
[SPEAKER_01]: fulvic acid, uh, are the things that are
helping blind it to freely get to where it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything else in regards to
bricks that growers should know or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have any advice for somebody who's
kind of new to bricks?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just starting measurements for the
first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that bricks is a good
reinforcement of a lot of times what you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see with your eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if your plants are looking
healthy and you check your bricks and it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes back around that 12 level,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking at the plants,
they're not looking healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You check the bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at that five or six range.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can almost infer from that,
that you're having an issue with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an important thing to know and
to kind of help you on the road to
[SPEAKER_01]: improving your bricks levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's not the, you know, it's not the
end all be all of, of what's in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to isolate specifically
what nutrient is in what ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like a SAP analysis test,
uh, can do that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But bricks, again, you, you want to know
what your bricks levels are because it can
[SPEAKER_01]: indicate the nutritional levels in your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's also going to indicate,
you know, how good your, uh, IPM can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, avoidance of pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to know it's,
it's another tool in the tool belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good info there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this has been a quick straight to
the point episode.
