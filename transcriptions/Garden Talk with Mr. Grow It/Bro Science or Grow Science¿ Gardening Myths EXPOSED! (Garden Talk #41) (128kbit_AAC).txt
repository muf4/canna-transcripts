[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You put so many materials, so many ions in
the root zone that it creates a high
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure gradient outside the roots,
which forces it into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that you're adding microbially is
going to create in its own environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to create some slimes and films
and you're not going to know what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of gross science just to be
like, oh, all microbes die whenever you
[SPEAKER_02]: put synthetic fertilizers on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, some are super sensitive,
but some are actually really resistant to
[SPEAKER_02]: what these chemicals are putting down and
actually can help synthetic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you brew compost tea, do not adjust the
pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, put it inside your medium
and the buffering index inside your soil
[SPEAKER_02]: will figure out where it wants the proper
pH to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow more plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon based systems are going to grow
more cannabinoids, more alkaloids within
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 41.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Tim McCormick.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the owner of Cultured Biologics,
which is a company that formulates and
[SPEAKER_01]: manufactures an organic product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim has an extensive background in
horticulture, everything from chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology, soil science, plant
physiology, etymology, and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode he breaks down broscience,
versus growscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go over a ton of different gardening
processes that many deem as broscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim reveals the actual science that exists
for them, if any.

[SPEAKER_01]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Tim McCormick from
Cultured Biologics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing, Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited for this episode today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about bro
science versus grow science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I have a whole bunch of highly
debated topics that many people swear
[SPEAKER_01]: work, while others claim that it's just
bro science, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tim and I met at MJBizCon, and I thought
Tim would be the perfect person to have on
[SPEAKER_01]: this, since he has such deep knowledge in
several different areas of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've actually developed your own organic
fertilizer, as well as 100% water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into that in more detail later
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this is going to be a great
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, can you give the listeners an
introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe tell us a little bit about yourself,
and kind of how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my experience in gardening goes back to
my childhood, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mother has been a horticulturist for
like 35 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So take your kid to work day was take Tim
to the greenhouse, make him water,
[SPEAKER_02]: make him pick off leaves, make him go move
pallets and the boxes of plants and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been gardening since I was a
little kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my real career experience got started
when I got out of college.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't really know what I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a degree in chemistry, emphasis on
compound pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was how to make medicine for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really like how the
pharmaceutical industry was kind of how
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of geared to making pills for
pills for pills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not really where I wanted to come
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really wanted to make natural medicine
for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of got out, didn't really know
what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by happenstance, got to me a
business owner trying to start a
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer company out of Fort Collins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Asked me and my best friend, Greg,
if we wanted to move.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a marketer, wanted to move to
Colorado to start a career in the
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being a compound chemist, I was like,
absolutely, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have experience with growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time, I was growing my own
medicinal plants inside my closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: just trying to go into school for
chemistry, kind of growing plants
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponically at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then kind of got thrown into this mix of
the fertilizer company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from there, I got to travel the world,
working with agrochemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Latin America, domestic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my career background is in commercial
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I come from, instead of the hydroponic
industry being where I started,
[SPEAKER_02]: I started with commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And got to do some really cool stuff with
Catia.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Latin American university that does
cacao genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do bananas, pineapples, so a lot of
tropical fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I came over to working with the
University of Florida Extension Program.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really got into how to use these organic
chemicals on our irrigation systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: our irrigation technologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, my background really stems from
me trying to take these organic materials
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're making with our fertilizer
company and applying them to our
[SPEAKER_02]: industrialized technology and trying to
find a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: About four years ago, one of my best
friends and I decided to break off and
[SPEAKER_02]: start Culture Biologics, formulating our
own organic fertilizers, microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculants, biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been doing this for about
four years now, pretty steadily.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just in the process of now
releasing all my formulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you mentioned through DMs,
chemistry, microbiology, plant physiology,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil sciences, plant pathology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a whole bunch of different areas would
you have knowledge in, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was actually really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people would go get their
bachelor's and master's and PhDs and
[SPEAKER_02]: postdoc and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of got my pseudo master's working
with the University of Florida Extension
[SPEAKER_02]: Program, because I got to work with plant
pathology professors, entomology
[SPEAKER_02]: professors, soil scientists.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point when I was working down in
Latin America, I worked with the United
[SPEAKER_02]: Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of taught me regenerative
agriculture and what we need to do to kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of repair the land throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even they kind of merged into my own
degree with pharmaceuticals, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: European Commission, we're working with
the European Commission on trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out how to reduce health care
costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after all the scientists and hundreds
of people at symposiums trying to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out how do we reduce health care,
the number one thing it came back to is
[SPEAKER_02]: growing nutritious food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a real full circle experience for
me, trying to figure out how to grow food
[SPEAKER_02]: better and how to make people healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing, let's dive into powdered
nutrients versus liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people claim that 99% of the
liquid in liquid fertilizer is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're mostly paying for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is how much liquid fertilizer
bottle is water?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does all of that actually require to
raise like I know water needs to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, chemicals don't bind
together, you know, and it's effectively
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is it true that 99% is water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are companies ripping off consumers by
giving excess water in their fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not exactly a clear cut answer to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So water suspends, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Water is a solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's only a certain amount of
salt you can put into water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it starts falling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, imagine you putting in sugar into
a glass of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to dissolve, it's going to
dissolve, it's going to dissolve till you
[SPEAKER_02]: put too much in there and then it's going
to start falling out and it won't go into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a chemical point of view,
you do need water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do need other dissolution agents like
weak acids and things like that to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: keep all the salts broken down,
to keep everything from binding together,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: But commonly it's like 50 to 80% water
usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep that on the low end for when
I make my liquid formulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of, I mean, the hydroponic
industry is taking all these concentrated
[SPEAKER_02]: salts and putting them in the liquid form
and diluting them essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Powdered salts being as the most
concentrated, you know, we do have a
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller amount of salts going into the
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most of the time it is watered down
salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody sells the same general
formulations with the same amount of water
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty wasteful, especially when you
get to like the shipping end of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So quick answer, 50 to 80% long answer
doesn't always apply to that.
Gotcha.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's talk about organic versus
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when talking about synthetic
nutrients, they're already in a form that
[SPEAKER_01]: is available for the plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in an ionized form, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With organic, a lot of these amendments,
they need to be broken down by microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: first and then put into a form that the
plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can easily overfeed using synthetic
nutrients because the plant is just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to continue to uptake, uptake,
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people call this force feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what they refer to it as.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to organic, many people say
you can't over-fertilize when growing
[SPEAKER_01]: organic because the plant is only going to
uptake what it needs, when it needs it via
[SPEAKER_01]: the exudates it releases for the
beneficial bacteria that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that exchange is happening between the
exudates being released, being exchanged
[SPEAKER_01]: for the potential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question is, can you over-fertilize
when growing organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can overdo the kelps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can overdo the alfalfas.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely overdo the guanos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just understand these, these materials
still have nitrates and phosphates in
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blood muon has lots of nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Guano has lots of phosphates and nitrates
usually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put too much down, and I've done
this before on my outdoor properties,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can nuke a crop real easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of it takes time to break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it is pretty available
immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest difference between the
synthetic is you create osmotic pressure
[SPEAKER_02]: at the root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you put so many materials, so many ions
in the root zone that it creates a high
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure gradient outside the roots,
which forces it into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can kind of train a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I see people like with Athena
and Front Row and they can get up to like
[SPEAKER_02]: five feet high VEC and peak flower because
they've been training their plant to take
[SPEAKER_02]: that osmotic pressure and they work
through the plant up to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas like the organics, like we just
said, the exudates, the mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_02]: the beneficial bacteria, the network will
slowly break down and make compounds in a
[SPEAKER_02]: form that the plant can just take up
passively.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really hard to overdo or
overfeeding organics, but you can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics is about finding an equalization
and harmonization between the life in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and the materials that are required
to be broken down for plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then diving deep into the microbes
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: When using synthetic nutrients,
like we mentioned before, they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: ionized form already available for plant
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are microbes useful when using synthetic
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say that microbes are going to
be able to survive in the high selenium
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be useful when using
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people say that microbes are
completely pointless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should not be inoculating your medium
when using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the real deal with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So funny aspects.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had this conversation with Colin
from Cropking the other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome consultant, awesome dude for,
you know, all things plant related,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he had the conversation of,
you know, he doesn't believe microbes are
[SPEAKER_02]: needed in a hydroponic medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my answer is kind of twofold.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, you have to break down hydroponics
and like synthetic fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_02]: like are using just water culture?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are using any substrates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because cocoa and pea are still inert,
rockwool is still inert and they're still
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I go to water culture,
I like to keep everything as sterile as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that you're adding microbially is
going to create in its own environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to create some slimes and films
and you're not going to know what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time I will say microbes are
effective in the water culture
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically, so like your deep water
culture, your aeroponics, your sprinkler
[SPEAKER_02]: irrigation, all that fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time that you really are,
I feel microorganisms are effective is
[SPEAKER_02]: using them as biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, trichoderma, certain strains of
bacillus produce antifungal antibacterial
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds that you can put like root
shield or Bavaria brassia with a botanic
[SPEAKER_02]: guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those are really good for
protecting the root system, killing any
[SPEAKER_02]: type of pests that might be in the root
system, but I wouldn't be using any type
[SPEAKER_02]: of nutrient cycling bacteria or any type
of mycorrhizae in a water culture
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic system.
[SPEAKER_02]: My second part of this is like if you use
a substrate medium like cocoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: rockwool, pea, and it's all inert,
still hydroponics, but you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate for the organisms to live
within.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here is where you find the usefulness
of microorganisms I feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mycorrhizae, it can be helpful,
it can be handy.
[SPEAKER_02]: With mycorrhizae, it requires an insoluble
phosphorous source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the mycorrhizae takes that
insoluble like rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes that insoluble rock phosphate and
it digests it and breaks it down and then
[SPEAKER_02]: it's connected intervanguously within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then it just injects the phosphorous in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're using synthetic phosphates,
you're not giving the mycorrhizae any
[SPEAKER_02]: food.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not giving it any of its natural
function to actually survive inside the
[SPEAKER_02]: media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't really think mycorrhizae is
a good choice when you're using synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you have the nutrient
cycling bacteria, plant growth promoting
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizobacteria, they release natural
hormones around the root systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: increase root production.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can help stabilize the pH so you
don't get pH fluctuations throughout your
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also help break down, if salts do
end up binding together and locking you
[SPEAKER_02]: out or coming together and creating some
precipitant molecules in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start to see the white crust on the
top of your substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nutrient cycling bacteria like the
bacillus can help break that down and
[SPEAKER_02]: alleviate lockout and just keep PPM
steady.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends on what you're trying
to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much of a dynamic answer,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, using SLF 100 enzymes,
always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just keeps everything clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It keeps everything broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a product called Flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weak organic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Use those to keep everything broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really suggest going really
hardcore with the microorganisms inside a
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you mentioned hydroponic system,
inner mediums, you wouldn't necessarily go
[SPEAKER_01]: towards using microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how about soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: You did mention some benefits that really
microbes can be useful in soil when using
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I try to steer away from using
synthetics in any type of soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because you have a rhizosphere,
an environment in the root zone where you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to take care of certain
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes they can be really sensitive
to synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, nutrient cycling
bacteria are okay with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you can really impact a
mycorrhizal network by using high
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if it comes to water
culture, I stay away from everything
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganism related outside of
biopesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, your trichodermas, your
bacillus, your antifungal, antibacterials.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in an inert medium like cocoa,
like peat, rockwool, I like to throw in
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient cycling bacteria for their
ability to create hormones around the root
[SPEAKER_02]: zone, cycle nutrients, stabilize the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm in soil, I go very, very heavy with
microorganisms and try to stay away from
[SPEAKER_02]: salts as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Salts can tank out the microbial sphere
that you've created.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, keep it organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil is supposed to be a slower uptake
anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you rely on the
microorganisms to kind of be the fuel in
[SPEAKER_02]: the car, the gas pedal, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more microbes you usually put into an
environment, you know, within good means,
[SPEAKER_02]: the better off your soils do because they
can break down all the amendments that are
[SPEAKER_02]: unavailable to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually goes right into my next
question, which is, you know, in a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic growing books and you hear in
documentaries and stuff, synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients killing off microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got people on the opposing
side of things that say, no, synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, microbes actually consume
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do synthetic nutrients really kill
microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that bro science?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's bro science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, these microbes, they can,
you can put a microbial spore on like a
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial spore, a fungal spore on a
meteorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot that meteorite to Pluto.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as Pluto has an environment
that is conducive to microorganisms being
[SPEAKER_02]: alive, the proper oxygen, proper CO2,
all the food sources and things like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll come alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we use spore forming bacteriums
all the time, or bacteria all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, with our teas and they can
resist, spores themselves can resist 2000
[SPEAKER_02]: ppm of synthetic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can withstand a pH swing of 4.0 to
9.0.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can, you know, as long as they have a
conducive environment to germinate,
[SPEAKER_02]: these microbes will come alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually some of these nutrient
cycling strains and subspecies of bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: we were finding actually solubilize some
of these salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of soil remediations that we've
been, that I've been doing throughout my
[SPEAKER_02]: decade of experience in agriculture,
we use microorganisms to remediate high
[SPEAKER_02]: salinity soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of bro science just to be
like, Oh, all microbes die whenever you
[SPEAKER_02]: put synthetic fertilizers on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's very much of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, some are super sensitive,
but some are actually really resistant,
[SPEAKER_02]: resilient to these chemicals are putting
down and actually can help synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that people get caught up on
is pH adjusters, like using pH up and pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for the audience, I've asked these
questions to all the people as well on the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to ask multiple people this
question, you know, and see if the,
[SPEAKER_01]: see if the answers vary a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far they've been about the same,
but pH adjusters, you know, so people
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly use for pH down, phosphoric acid,
pH up people commonly use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually a potassium hydroxide or a
potassium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: People swear that if you're using those to
adjust your water or nutrient solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, once you pour that into medium,
you're killing off microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, really it comes down to,
it's so funny how some of these isms,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I call it, kind of spun up a couple of
different ways as the years go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so adjusting your pH up and down with
phosphoric acid, strong acid, strong
[SPEAKER_02]: bases, isn't going to tank out your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about soil is that you have what
we call buffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's buffering index is what counteracts
the acidity or the alkalinity inside your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil that the organic matter inside your
soil, the compost, the worm castings,
[SPEAKER_02]: all of those are buffering agents that are
going to help protect the living organisms
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what I will say with that,
when you're making compost teas,
[SPEAKER_02]: like brewed compost teas, like you put
your, your worm castings, your compost
[SPEAKER_02]: with your molasses in your water and you
aerate it for 24 hours, you just create a
[SPEAKER_02]: living network of like a bio, call it a
biofilm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a long network of bacteria layered on
top of each other that creates these long
[SPEAKER_02]: strands of filaments.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you start, because it's already took
24 hours to condition itself, it's at its
[SPEAKER_02]: optimal pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's consuming the carbohydrates at an
optimal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take that and then you start
upping pH, upping pH, downing the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, the colony, the living colony of
brewed bacteria and fungi that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: created.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you will impact it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you for just, just general stance,
if you brew a compost tea, do not adjust
[SPEAKER_02]: the pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if it's five, five,
I don't care if it's six, oh, I don't care
[SPEAKER_02]: if it's seven, whatever it is,
put it inside your medium and the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the buffering index inside your soil will
figure out where it wants the proper pH to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're using a brewed compost tea,
yes, it will, it will harm, phosphoric
[SPEAKER_02]: acid will harm the bacterial network.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using an instant tea,
like all these instant microbials,
[SPEAKER_02]: like our easy tea, we use bacterial
spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I just kind of just,
just went over, like those can withstand
[SPEAKER_02]: high pH swings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you need a pH and instant micro
microbial mix, you know, you'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use a liquid inoculant,
like a micro blife, I would treat it like
[SPEAKER_02]: a living, like you just brewed a tea
because they are living organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing is like, I guess the
latter part of this conversation is,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really, really, really, really hard
to kill microorganisms with a pH swings.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really die.
[SPEAKER_02]: They go dormant, you know, and I feel like
it's a lot of things in our industries is
[SPEAKER_02]: overly oversimplified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and as we, you know, do these
podcasts and as we do watch YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: videos, you know, people doing different
gardening segments, the telephone game can
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just, just, I guess just a side note,
you know, it doesn't, bacteria won't die
[SPEAKER_02]: because you put it in an improper pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go dormant and it's going to
wait till the pH range gets in a proper
[SPEAKER_02]: range that the bacteria can come back
alive and then it'll regain function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more follow up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the people that swear that you should
be using an organic method for pH up or pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down, like for example, pH down,
they swear you should use lemon juice or
[SPEAKER_01]: vinegar instead of phosphoric acid,
or they swear that you should be using
[SPEAKER_01]: baking soda for pH up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of the potassium hydroxide or
potassium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Disagree with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, it really depends on your
medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a very sterile hydroponic
medium, the strong acids, the strong
[SPEAKER_02]: bases, the hydroxides, the phosphoric
acids, those are fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will work just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're in a soil, I do recommend,
and you have like a, if you have a living
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganism environment to be concerned
about, go with the weak, the weak acids,
[SPEAKER_02]: the weak bases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like citric acid, like your lemon
juice, your acetic acid, your vinegars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all weak acids that won't harm
your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our flush is actually a weak organic acid
and you can put on your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually a great skin cleaner.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so it's so gentle that it will,
it won't, it won't harm your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: It won't harm any type of the organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using any type of pH up,
like I said, hydroxides work in a sterile
[SPEAKER_02]: environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like introducing hydroxides into
my organic systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: That also goes with the kelp extracts,
the 1, 0, 18 kelp extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, kelp is organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelp can be used in organic systems,
but that 18% potassium is strictly from
[SPEAKER_02]: potassium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend putting that inside of a
organic system because of hydroxides.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to do it, use carbonates,
calcium carbonate, potassium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're, you know, you're trying to pH
up, limestone is liquid, like calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: carbonate, potassium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all good alternatives to those
really heavy chemicals that you can use in
[SPEAKER_02]: like synthetic hydroponic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a pretty good transition
into your product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're going to talk about some of
the pro science first, pro science to
[SPEAKER_01]: start, then we'll get into your product
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people aren't like, oh,
this is just an hour long infomercial for
[SPEAKER_01]: his product line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, it really intrigues me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have, you've developed an
organic fertilizer that's a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a growth 360, a bloom 360.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also have the PK blossom, the calcium
and the flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk to us about, you know,
what's in the grow 360 and bloom 360,
[SPEAKER_01]: how those work?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, it's a true one part fertilizing
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a one part vegetative base.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a one part bloom base.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, what I wanted to do is
get away from the six to 20 bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: People have to constantly mix and be a
cocktail mad chemist, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to keep it as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you just need to just grow your
plants as, as simple as possible,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can just take these two products and
it has all your macros, all your
[SPEAKER_02]: secondaries, all your trace elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: One's just arranged for a, the vegetative
stage and the others for the blooming and
[SPEAKER_02]: fruiting stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: With that, I, we use zero nitrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We only use protein nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't use any lab made phosphates.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about earlier about
mycorrhizae needing food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, rock phosphate is the, is the food
source for mycorrhizae, rock phosphates in
[SPEAKER_02]: all of our indigenous soils on our earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then on top of that, we use calcium
carbonate and magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of those have been attached to amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're amino based.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our trace elements, I don't use
any EDTA chelated anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we talk about being,
plants being force fed where like these
[SPEAKER_02]: EDTA chelated molecules, they don't care
what the plant wants at any time.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just go into the plant, guess what
their job is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the times you get that harsh
burning and it's because of lab made
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphates being really harsh.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from EDTA chelated micronutrients
that you're in the week seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: a flower, six a flower, and those are
still being shoved into the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you want them to or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I want to do and what I searched
out is I wanted to use an amino humic
[SPEAKER_02]: based trace elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's iron sulfate, manganese sulfate,
copper sulfate, all the sulfate based
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules of the trace elements,
but they're digested and chelated to amino
[SPEAKER_02]: acids and humic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get the ionic uptake like you do
with like the EDTA chelated trace
[SPEAKER_02]: elements, but it's in a form that's
wrapped in carbon, the carbon molecules,
[SPEAKER_02]: humic acids, amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the biggest thing I wanted to do with
this is most nutrient lines are nitrate
[SPEAKER_02]: based.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to be carbon based.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrates elongate the plant cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nitrates grow plant matter and which is
good when you're trying to vegetatively
[SPEAKER_02]: grow a plant, but when you're trying to
have the plant synthesize other molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: like terpenes and flavonoids and
cannabinoids, all of those are carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the limiting factor for the plant to be
able to produce those is going to be the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of carbon you give a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to make a nutrient line that
was that was carbon based where
[SPEAKER_02]: everything's wrapped in a carbon ring.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is microbial foods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're putting into an organic
system, it's a microbial food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two, I wanted it to be bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put it into a hydroponic system,
it's still 100% bioavailable plant
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these two bases really encompassed your
amino acids, your seaweed extracts,
[SPEAKER_02]: and your humic acids, along with all of
your macro, secondaries, and trace
[SPEAKER_02]: elements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our base fertilizing system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have the supplements.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the calcium, which is an organic
CalMag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use calcium carbonate, magnesium
sulfate that's digested into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a protein sulfate based calcium
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the times when you use CalMag
inside, these synthetic systems are all
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrate based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're using them heavy in flour,
it causes a bunch of fox tailing and your
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers get a lot of airiness to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: With this, you have proteins and proteins
in calcium all go to building strong,
[SPEAKER_02]: structure in your flowers, strong
structure in your plant cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that there's a 3% sulfate charge
on there, sulfur is in every single
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a limiting factor for your terpene
production based on how much sulfur you
[SPEAKER_02]: have going into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a CalMag product that's kind of
designed to be used heavily in flour when
[SPEAKER_02]: you need it the most, but won't cause the
fox tailing and goes to really fortifying
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last of the supplements is the PK
Blossom.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an organic bloom booster essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to take micronized rock
phosphate, potassium sulfate and calcium
[SPEAKER_02]: carbonate and put them into a concentrated
product so you don't have to use mother of
[SPEAKER_02]: all blooms, Moab.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to use Cool Bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to use all these synthetic
bloom boosters to get the flowers to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: to get the plant to root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really set in and enlarge and ripen
throughout its flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but certainly not least is our
flush product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably one of my favorite products uses
a weak organic acid called
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroxycarboxylic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these flushing agents like Cleanz
out there, like Drip Clean, they're all
[SPEAKER_02]: forms of bleach.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you put them into your system,
yes, they might remove the salt buildup.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might remove all of these excess
materials inside your substrate,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it literally sterilizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It nukes your entire rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of your mycorrhizae, all of the
microbes you've been using throughout your
[SPEAKER_02]: entire growth cycle, you put Cleanz in
there or any of these bleach flushing
[SPEAKER_02]: agents and it completely nukes out any
microbes and you just end up wasting your
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I wanted to do is make a flushing
agent that was one carbon based to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: go with this whole carbon based
fertilizing system.
[SPEAKER_02]: But two, make it safe for microorganisms
and probably one of the most diverse
[SPEAKER_02]: products we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a water conditioner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have hard water, it breaks apart
the carbonates and bicarbonates and makes
[SPEAKER_02]: it soft water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the soil, it acts as a soil
conditioner, adds porosity to soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: so it prevents compaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great for those no-till guys that
over time you get the compacted soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're dealing with annual flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not dealing with perennials.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not dealing with ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_02]: These plants don't like a hard compact
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the aeration.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the porosity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this flushing agent, this flush,
allows porosity to happen within the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the third part is that it also acts as
a nutrient chelator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you add it to your reservoirs where
they're using salts or where they're using
[SPEAKER_02]: organics, it helps to break everything
down and chelate and attach itself to
[SPEAKER_02]: these molecules so the plant recognizes it
as, since it's a carbon based acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: so when it attaches itself, the plant can
tell it has carbon attached to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant goes, oh, I know what carbon
is, and grabs it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes your nutrients more
bioavailable when you use it with your
[SPEAKER_02]: feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you pretty much answered my next
question, which is, is this product line
[SPEAKER_01]: usable with all water types?
[SPEAKER_01]: So rainwater, tap water, Auro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like, even if you're using
tap water, and it's got chlorine in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got chloramine in it, that you can
still use that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cool thing about these base
fertilizers, because they have humic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: they have humic acid in them, they buffer
out chlorine and chloramine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they can actually help buffer some of
the tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're putting these organic
fertilizers into your tap water and
[SPEAKER_02]: putting those into your soil system,
you can actually help reduce the impact of
[SPEAKER_02]: chlorine and chloramine just by using the
base fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, pH is a big topic, specifically when
it talks about synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be in a proper pH range so
the plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be in that certain range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what is your overall thoughts on
monitoring pH when growing organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many people out there that say,
completely ignore pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever water you have put in there,
the microbes are going to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there are other people that say,
no, you still want to make sure you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting the proper pH into the medium in
order for the plant to be able to uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients, for the microbes to be able
to work properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like to keep everything in the
soil system between 6.5 and 7.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually most of these agents that you're
using or products you're using are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to keep it there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But compost teas go down to 5.5 sometimes,
and I don't recommend pHing those.
[SPEAKER_02]: The soil will figure everything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing about an organic system is
that you're relying on your soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: the microorganisms, the organic matter,
the amendments, you're relying on the
[SPEAKER_02]: limestone to buffer and to keep everything
stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nectar for the gods, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in there is all fermented and
everything in there is extremely acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still need to keep it up and raise the
pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a liquid limestone product that
works great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it goes into the soil,
you're still going to have the high amount
[SPEAKER_02]: of hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what creates something acidic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's high amounts of hydrogen ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What creates it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alkaline is a high amount of hydroxide
ions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buffer it and you can get a stable
pH and get an equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're still going to put these high
amounts of hydrogen ions that you just
[SPEAKER_02]: buffered up, you're still going to put
them into your soil and the soil is still
[SPEAKER_02]: going to react with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biggest thing about all these organic
systems, I wouldn't worry too much about
[SPEAKER_02]: pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely don't do anything crazy that's
going to like pH of 10 or 12 that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to throw anything out of whack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't put anything in pH of 4 or lower in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you can stay between the 5 to 7,
5 range, the soil will buffer and figure
[SPEAKER_02]: itself out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why you got to rely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're creating an ecosystem and you have
to be able to rely on that and not be
[SPEAKER_02]: constantly at the wheel all the time of
trying to make sure everything is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about PGRs, so plant growth
regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people hear about PGRs and they
automatically think bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad, never use PGRs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything about PGRs is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have trouble saying this word,
but plectrobutrazole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I struggle saying that word for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one PGR that is really bad,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's carcinogenic related to cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are good PGRs, natural PGRs within
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us a little bit about PGRs,
the good and the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paclo, for example, is a bad plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad PGR.
[SPEAKER_02]: And PGR, for those who don't know,
plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hormones that control and direct a
function within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bush load has Paclo in it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go to an ornamental nursery and you
see all these shrubs the same height.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see them all the same width.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see all these perfect shrubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shrubs by themselves do not want to do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the same thing as most annual
plants do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd have an apical dominant side and
you'll see one branch go way up and the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the shrub will be kind of
lopsided.
[SPEAKER_02]: We spray Paclo on it and what happens is
it regulates the hormonal function of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets rid of the apical dominance and
the apical dominance is derived from
[SPEAKER_02]: auxins, one of the five plant hormones
naturally occurring within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paclo goes in there, tells the plant to
stop doing that and to grow more lateral,
[SPEAKER_02]: then to grow vertical.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the old 90s hydroponic days,
you'd spray your plants right before you
[SPEAKER_02]: go into bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them stay horizontal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kick down the stretch by almost,
you have almost zero stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kick it down almost all the way and
you have these nice little fat,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, bushes across the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about this and what I don't like
about PGRs is most PGRs are carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most, they're cancer causing and you
know, when you're using ornamental plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not, people use these chemicals on
them and you're not like, you're not
[SPEAKER_02]: eating an ornamental plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not smoking an ornamental plant,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much one of these things of
like, it's used for kind of like a hands
[SPEAKER_02]: off, you're going to look at the plant
type of situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we go into consumable crops,
then we have an issue with these PGRs
[SPEAKER_02]: becoming cancer causing because we're
really ingesting them and these half-lives
[SPEAKER_02]: are sometimes six months, six to 12 months
at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time you finish the cycle,
it's still existing within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's really important to know
that PGRs are bad, but it's also important
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand and this is where I kind of,
AFCO is a overlying agency that we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They decide what your heavy metals are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a government agency that dictates
what fertilizers, what agents,
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients we can use in these,
in our, in our fertilizer products that we
[SPEAKER_02]: sell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of these PG, all these PGRs are under
the pesticide branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're, they're very much restricted
and they have a very strict standard in
[SPEAKER_02]: which you have to use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's protocols to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I argue with the government
officials about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that there are plant growth
promoters and plant growth regulators.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have, for example, you have the Paclo,
the synthetic hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also have kelp extracts, which has
natural hormones in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alfalfa has natural plant hormones in
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, we have to get into like the,
the, the monotony of what is regulating
[SPEAKER_02]: the growth of a plant and what is just
promoting the growth of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: because not all hormones that are
categorized as PGRs are what I consider
[SPEAKER_02]: PGRs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Paclo is a growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant growth promoters is what I call
them, PGPs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the natural hormones you get
from plant extracts, algae extracts,
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed extracts, alfalfa, even amino
acids have a plant growth promoting
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are okay and those are safe to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend using those because those
don't control and tell the plant to stop
[SPEAKER_02]: doing natural function and do this
abnormal thing like Paclo or Bushlo does
[SPEAKER_02]: where it just levels out the canopy and
gets rid of the pickle dominance.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, they promote the stage at which the
plant's in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I use a seaweed extract,
when the plant is vegetatively growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to help develop more nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to help lateral branching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to tell the plant just to
stop growing and just to rearrange its
[SPEAKER_02]: entire hormonal structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alfalfa as well, they're plant growth
promoters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to promote whatever stage
the plant is in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those where I want really the
delineation between the PGRs and PGPs to
[SPEAKER_02]: occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want people to look for PGPs because
those are actually what we can use to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase crop production without using any
type of carcinogens to kind of harm,
[SPEAKER_02]: harm our bodies, to harm the people we
are, we're providing medicine to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good info there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for breaking that down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to light cycle, particularly
the 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of people that say 24
hour light cycle is the best light cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: for vegetative growth because you're going
to have that level of synthesis going and
[SPEAKER_01]: going and going and going.
[SPEAKER_01]: People on the opposing side says that the
plant needs the period of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there have been studies that
particularly on the period of darkness to
[SPEAKER_01]: where things that happen down below the,
you know, in the soil microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, exudates are being released
during the darkness period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us your overall thoughts on
the 24 hour light cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it bad?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like to give plants a rest period
because as soon as the lights turn off,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a whole bunch of hormones being
rerouted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down to the root zone, um, abscisic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, there's five plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's cytokinins, there's, um,
oxens, there's gibberellins, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: abscisic acid and ethylene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, normally when you're seeing the top
growth in the canopy, you're looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: cellular elongation, oxens, you're looking
at cellular division, cytokinins,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at cellular bulking,
which is gibberellins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but what happens below the subsurface
of the soil, you, the roots are releasing
[SPEAKER_02]: abscisic acid and ethylene back and forth
to grow left, to grow right, to go down,
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that darkness period,
I like to give it the plants because the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is allowed to hormonally rearrange
itself naturally and actually use those,
[SPEAKER_02]: those hormones in the root zone,
um, to, to do its natural function that it
[SPEAKER_02]: would do during in nature, you know,
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now kind of piggybacking off of that,
some people do an extended darkness period
[SPEAKER_01]: before flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this comes down to phytochrome,
PR and the awake state, sleep state,
[SPEAKER_01]: PFR.
[SPEAKER_01]: When PFR accumulates more than PR,
the plant starts making fluorogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluorogen is a flowering hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's often said that giving your,
your plant a period of darkness,
[SPEAKER_01]: an extended period, some people do 36
hours of darkness between vegetative and
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help them accumulate more
PFR, make more fluorogen, transition of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was that all correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I just said?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you said there and, and, uh,
you know, is that true or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: So theoretically, yes, on, on paper and
textbook, that is how the plant does its
[SPEAKER_02]: dark cycles and how it rearranges itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the problem, the issue we get into is,
and this goes across collegiate,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, studies, this goes across third party
laboratories, it goes across the
[SPEAKER_02]: government.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's so hard to quantify this
biochemical reaction to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's occurring and to know what levels
are where, because the plant's constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: going through a metabolic change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where the government doesn't
like the us to be able to list like algae
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts or seaweed extracts and say they
have hormonal activity because we spray it
[SPEAKER_02]: on there and then we can't, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't quantify like, yeah, we know the
plant grows better, but we don't,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are not able to quantify how much of
these hormones are going into doing what
[SPEAKER_02]: and what the biochemical cascade is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're, we as, as, as humans are
still, still figuring out what these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants do and how to quantify them
properly in an effective manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, I personally, and this is
where the scientist in me comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally do not know how much
fluorogens being produced in those dark
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't, I can't tell you yes,
for sure that is happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where, that's where I would call
bro science, you know, where we know that
[SPEAKER_02]: this process happens so we can extrapolate
and be like, Hey, what if we do this to
[SPEAKER_02]: our plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that theoretical thing would
happen to them, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's like, I, I like to be able to
quantify things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, growth rates, uh, uh, uh,
reproduction, lateral branching,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, production weight, biomass weight,
usable medicine weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can, I can, I can quantify, we touch
those things and I know that's happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I can't quantify.
[SPEAKER_02]: We say that, yes, I put my plant in
darkness.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 36 hours and all of a sudden I cut a
week off my flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we extrapolate it and then we
apply it and we think it does stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just keep doing it because
that's what everybody else does,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So bro science until it can be confirmed
as actual science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing with the dark cycle at
the end of the plant life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that I'm sure you were going to get
into that conversation too, where it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, I, you know, the, the theory is that
the plant produces more resin whenever the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun's about to come up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause anticipating being hit by UV
radiations and the resin glands is
[SPEAKER_02]: spherical and perfectly spherical where it
diffracts the UV radiations before it hits
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you leave a plant at the end of its
life cycle and darkness, you can increase
[SPEAKER_02]: resin production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, bro science, cause we don't
have any quantifiable data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the research I've seen that people,
you know, take it to a lab and then get
[SPEAKER_02]: their, their flowers analyzed afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no consistent data that shows it
does increase trichome production,
[SPEAKER_02]: increases cannabinoid levels, increases
alkaloid levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we have been able to see that,
that drought stress in like peppers
[SPEAKER_02]: increases capsaicin content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could extrapolate and cross apply
that to the medicinal plants and be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, if it happens here, it'll happen
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, we don't, we don't,
there's, it's all bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any quantifiable data to
show yes or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought up the darkness
before harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically people do 48 hours of darkness
before harvesting last ditch effort to
[SPEAKER_01]: create trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the opposing side says,
well, even if you do our creating
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes, they're not going to that
potent state, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not enough time for them to be in
that potent state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad you kind of clarified that as
of right now, it's bro science until we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have studies done, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can actually turn it into actual
science potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now kind of going into trichome
development, you know, when we talked at
[SPEAKER_01]: MJBizCon, you talked a little bit about
trichome development, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in detail about how, when trichomes
develop, can you explain to us kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: just, I guess the life cycle of the
trichome or just everything you know about
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of trichome development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Trichomes by themselves are a defensive
mechanism that the many, many plants have
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect themselves from bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Creates a sticky surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the bugs are walking, the pests
are walking through, they get caught and
[SPEAKER_02]: then they die from lack of water,
lack of food, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: They contain fragrance molecules that
attracts and deters certain, certain
[SPEAKER_02]: pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trichomes themselves also usually contain
the alkaloids that everybody uses to
[SPEAKER_02]: partake in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It starts off as you have a stock,
a basin of it, and then you have a gland
[SPEAKER_02]: on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all silicon based, the stock to
the gland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then over time, the plant starts
filling those glands with oils and starts
[SPEAKER_02]: filling them with different alkaloids and
whatnot, which is why you can see it go
[SPEAKER_02]: from clear to cloudy to amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're literally watching a
biochemical reaction happen throughout a
[SPEAKER_02]: period of two months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants naturally, even in the vegetative
state, same with tomatoes and same with
[SPEAKER_02]: medical plants, they have trichomes on
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have any type of active
material in them until later on into the
[SPEAKER_02]: stages when the plants can biochemically
produce that because it takes all the
[SPEAKER_02]: hormones and everything in the flower
cycle to actually generate those active
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant starts off with CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's when you see the clear trichome
heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG is a precursor to all the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it goes into your active ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG, CBG, CBC, all of those cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it all terminates into CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you start to see the amber,
that's when you start to see the CBN
[SPEAKER_02]: arrangement start to occur.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chemical reaction to turn all those
actives into a more sedating compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start to see the glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start to wither and start to wither
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's usually the pull during peak
ripeness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how long does it take?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you mentioned two months for that
entire process to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes two months for it to go from
clear to cloudy to amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have like timeline for when it
turns?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a general broad stroke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight to nine weeks is our general flower
cycle for most of our commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not how it necessarily works with
16 weeks ativas, 18 weeks ativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will stay CBG until nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after nine weeks, then it'll
start to convert into the active
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, it takes another two
weeks at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be 16 weeks of a flower cycle to
get all those cannabinoids to fully mature
[SPEAKER_02]: and fully evolve into their peak
potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends on, sometimes there's
a seven week photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you get auto flowers,
which are five to seven weeks throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the entire thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends on the cultivar and
the variety and where it's from throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you have equatorial sativas,
you have things in the northern,
[SPEAKER_02]: southern parts of the world that are going
to always mature differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends on your variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I recommend everybody know
your variety to the point where you know
[SPEAKER_02]: what that biochemical cascade is doing at
the time that it's doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can pull at peak ripeness and not
have to go too far and start to have
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids degrade or go too early and
have it be premature where that didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: actually develop into what they should be
developed into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you have any tips for increasing
trachome development?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people talk about UV adding a UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's UVB, if I'm not mistaken,
towards the end of the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for like an hour or so per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people say there are different
nutrients that you could feed the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the end of the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help with the resin
production, trachome production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips for increasing
trachome development?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of where I got into making
my fertilizer line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because carbon based, everything about a
trachome is carbon based.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the universities and all
these, the conventional way to grow crops
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of missed the ball and one avenue of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where they think, they say that you need
17 essential elements to grow the plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have carbon, hydrogen and oxygen,
which are freely supplied that you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to provide yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where I kind of stray away
from the collegiate teachings of
[SPEAKER_02]: agrochemistry and agriculture,
where you do need to provide carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do need, and CO2 is a form of carbon
that you can increase production with,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It creates faster photosynthesis,
it can increase yields, it can increase
[SPEAKER_02]: growth production.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing is though, you need to add
carbon in a form that goes through the
[SPEAKER_02]: root system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plants take that and that's what
the plants use to make terpenes and
[SPEAKER_02]: flavonoids and cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in turn, that's the material inside
these resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: You increase more resin gland,
you increase more material inside these
[SPEAKER_02]: resin glands, you provide more precursors
for production of resin glands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like resin glands are silicon based,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have very much silicon in
your system, the plant isn't going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to assimilate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to have materials to
assimilate into a resin gland,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, yes, you can add, the lighting
is indicative of how much trachomes are
[SPEAKER_02]: produced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's because trachomes are a natural
protection from UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you increase radiation, your plants
will naturally increase trachome
[SPEAKER_02]: production, which is the UVBs or the
plasmas at the end of the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see CMHs have a higher blue and higher
blues are tighter wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant needs to produce more
trachomes to protect itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first and foremost, what I would say
is make sure your nutritional regimen is
[SPEAKER_02]: geared to producing those active
compounds, because that's what we are all
[SPEAKER_02]: growing this for, to have the medicinal
effects on our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, nitrate based systems are going to
grow more plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Carbon based systems are going to grow
more cannabinoids, more alkaloids within
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really it's making sure that you've got
your nutritional regimen dialed in and
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure your lighting is sufficient to
the needs of the plant to produce the
[SPEAKER_02]: trachome coverage you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's transition over to flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the more highly debatable topics
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has actually been studies on
flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we talk about flushing,
where there's so many definitions,
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's flushing as in running a large
amount of water through the medium for
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to reduce the PPM in the
medium as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way that the plant will start to
fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the chlorophyll will break down
and advance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's leaching, which is basically
just stopping feeding nutrients for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people call that flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really the goal for flushing,
I think a lot is to see a fade or see a
[SPEAKER_01]: senescence in the plant in order to I
mean, so many people say different reasons
[SPEAKER_01]: for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people say that it's going
to reduce the amount of nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual plant and it's going to provide a
cleaner ash of smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've heard so many different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arcscreen Technologies had a study on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you saw that or not,
but they came to the conclusion that the
[SPEAKER_01]: length of the flushing period did not
impact yield, potency, terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: or taste characteristics, which taste
characteristics are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the argument against that is that
number one, they're a nutrient company,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're going to tell you to feed
nutrients all the way up till the end
[SPEAKER_01]: because they make more money that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some would say that that's biased.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that they didn't measure,
which is what I'm interested in,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the amount of chlorophyll, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know chlorophyll breaks down during
drying, curing process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But flushing or not feeding nutrients for
the last couple of weeks, having that fade
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say that the chlorophyll
is going to break down during that period
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going to lead to a faster cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to taste that chlorophyll
weeks or over a month after you've dried
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're in that curing stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there haven't been any studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a, what's it called, spectrometer
to measure chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that hasn't happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, what's your thought
process on flushing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think it's not beneficial?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, where to start with this?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different angles.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many definitions for flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to look at this in two different
avenues, like harvesting flushing or,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh crap, I messed up flushing,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you look at the, oh crap situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fed too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to do what everybody else is
doing, hitting a 5 EC peak flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're trying to crank out the
weight in your commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yada, yada, yada.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get lockout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything starts tanking downhill.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants taking in too many nutrients
versus water and the plants dehydrating
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you see nutrient burn across the
board.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see deficiencies left and right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That flushing, I would use some type of
agent to break the bonds of all the salts
[SPEAKER_02]: inside your medium and release them and
flush them out and drain them from the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That flushing is like a corrective
flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm all about corrective
flushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Synthetic mediums are a little bit easier
to corrective flush than like organic
[SPEAKER_02]: systems because you have the organic
matter that ties everything up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that I do agree is a needed
flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what I consider the
flushing mechanism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when you go towards the harvesting
side of things, I like to look at
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting more like a ripening
perspective than just a get rid of
[SPEAKER_02]: everything there and let the plant fade
type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Naturally inside like organic systems,
the plants just naturally, you're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: deplete the soil essentially, the
reservoir capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to deplete it and the plants
going to take up less and less nutrition,
[SPEAKER_02]: which causes cannibalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an anibalism and cannibalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anibalism is the plant takes excess
external materials and synthesizes them
[SPEAKER_02]: into proteins and synthesizes them into
the plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: When the plant has a lack of nutrition,
coming in, a lack of elements coming in,
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant cannibalizes itself and starts
to rearrange where the nutrients go to the
[SPEAKER_02]: most important members of the plant,
either the flowers or the fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's what you need to preserve
in order to allow the genetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: the genes to continue on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I like to do is gradually reduce
the amount of feed towards the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle and let the plant cannibalize
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I believe that's where all the
flavors and that's where all the
[SPEAKER_02]: biological molecules that end up being all
these smells and all these flavors and
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking down the chlorophyll will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's mostly what,
what that's for is, is because when the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant ripens at the end of its life,
when senescence is happening, the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: is, takes the boron, creates borosacralate
and borosacralate or borosacralose is a
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar that the plant takes from the leaves
and translocates to the flowers and
[SPEAKER_02]: fruits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want that translocation to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where like these nitrates,
heavy nitrate diets, you really have a,
[SPEAKER_02]: have a really hard time getting that fade
without just stripping everything out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium and letting the plant have like
literally just zero, just water for the
[SPEAKER_02]: last two weeks to cause that type of
translocation senescence to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do that naturally and let the
plant naturally break itself down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, and with these carbon based
ingredients, like I do with my products,
[SPEAKER_02]: it allows the plants not to be constantly
fed nitrates to get their elemental
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can get all their elements without
having the excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe these excess nitrates give too
much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it, it causes an overabundance of
chlorophyll to stay inside the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why you get that hay smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why it's harder to get,
you have to cure longer and synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: systems to get a good flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're constantly perpetuating
chlorophyll to be produced by constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding it nitrates all the way to week
seven, week eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our solutions, you know, where it was
correct in their studies where it's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, it really doesn't, it doesn't affect
cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't affect terpene production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I think it comes down to exactly
what you said, it's like, how fast are you
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing chlorophyll to break down?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, that at the end of
whether you flush at the end or whether
[SPEAKER_02]: you're allowing the plant naturally
ripened through just a naturally depleted
[SPEAKER_02]: medium, I think that's where we're all
trying to get to is at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's life, you want that chlorophyll to
break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't want to providing it with a
bunch of nitrogen at the end of its,
[SPEAKER_02]: of its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's what's going to hold on to
that, that hay smell and not allow the
[SPEAKER_02]: proper essence of the flowers to come out
post harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tricky topic because like flushing
is just like this general broad statement,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have you heard of ice flushing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, bro science 101.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't think the temperature of the
rhizosphere has anything to do with the,
[SPEAKER_02]: the senescence or the ripening process of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant isn't like sitting out in nature
and just like, Oh, cold water is being
[SPEAKER_02]: sprinkled on me right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally know to start killing myself and
to ripen really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think cold water can lock out
some things so you get better colors
[SPEAKER_02]: because you have a, you have a different
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a different amount of elements
going into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the plant's not able to properly
take up certain things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you have a different biochemical
rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reaction happening, but I don't
really think ice water flushing is a,
[SPEAKER_02]: has been quantified to do anything other
than make you feel good that you're kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of emulating, you're kind of doing bio
mimicry and kind of emulating nature,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is that's what you're trying to do
by all means dress up as a tree and stand
[SPEAKER_02]: next to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, do whatever you feel like,
make sure your heart is great and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as a scientist, quantifiably speaking,
I don't see ice water doing anything other
[SPEAKER_02]: than adjusting the temperature of the root
zone, which shocks the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought up bringing out the colors as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Colder temps towards the end of flowering
is another kind of old school trick in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to bring out the colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening with the plant when you
kind of lower the temps and colors come
[SPEAKER_01]: up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lack of chlorophyll production is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants are green because chlorophyll,
you know, so it's it by the weather
[SPEAKER_02]: changing and doing all those things is
locking out the plant's ability to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: green.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you start to see the true colors
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And same with like when the plant starts
to cannibalize itself and starts to break
[SPEAKER_02]: down its own chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And start to do that fade.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're seeing the actual true colors of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants only green because of chlorophyll,
because that's the color it takes to
[SPEAKER_02]: absorb the sunlight, to absorb the
photons.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I think with cold weather
happening, it just changes how the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: able to produce chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the plant naturally knows towards the
end of its life cycle, it doesn't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the weather happens, it triggers
biochemical process to allow the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: anthocyanins or all these different colors
to come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about stem splitting?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever heard of stem splitting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those in favor of the technique argue that
it stresses the plant in a beneficial way,
[SPEAKER_01]: forcing it to uptake more nutrients and
produce bigger, more potent buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your thoughts on stem splitting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime people are trying to do one little
trick to get bigger and more resin coated
[SPEAKER_02]: buds, I always kind of like cock my head
to it because it's not a one way that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just going to make your buds be big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and stem splitting does stress
and it's the same thing that's like low
[SPEAKER_02]: stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have low stress and high stress
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it can cause the plant to be a
little more vigorous because it has to
[SPEAKER_02]: fight through the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once it heals the wounds,
the plants already has that much energy
[SPEAKER_02]: going to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily enjoy stressing my
plant out more than I need to and creating
[SPEAKER_02]: open wounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like it takes away energy from
other parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stem splitting, again, I haven't seen any
data showing that it increases yields or
[SPEAKER_02]: it increases, I mean, I can see that it
might increase cannabinoid production only
[SPEAKER_02]: because you stress the plant and the plant
produces metabolites when you stress it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I maybe see that, but as far as like
vigor and growth, I prefer, if I could
[SPEAKER_02]: have a plant where I didn't even have to
top it and it could just grow laterally
[SPEAKER_02]: and just like be a huge bush, I'll just do
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And feed the crap out of it, you know,
and just maintain a good harmonic system
[SPEAKER_02]: within the root zone to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the pH is stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make sure the PPM is right on point where
I need it to be and just hit it with as
[SPEAKER_02]: many growth promoters and microbes as I
can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so like I said, I see stem
splitting more of a bro science than I do
[SPEAKER_02]: actually any technical and it's not really
commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look at it, like if you
have a couple of plants you can definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: do that and you can baby them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have 100, 300, 500,000 plants,
you're not, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to cause way more
problems and you're going to get gain out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bud washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So washing your buds after harvesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love these questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saved the best questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bud washing, just a quick explanation
of what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people they'll dip it in,
they'll have a couple different buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll harvest their plant and then
they'll dip it first in baking soda and
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll go into water and then
they'll have another one that's water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're washing off their buds,
any debris that's on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supposedly there's a chemical reaction
happening with the baking soda and lemon
[SPEAKER_01]: juice that's allowing some of the debris
to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on bud washing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you know about bud washing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have always been against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the, the completely natural
approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even outdoor flower, my favorite flower
I've ever grown and smoked has been
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor, outdoor Cali plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, and that's a no washing,
no anything, but I have seen there's a guy
[SPEAKER_02]: on Instagram named Heavy Icer.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name's Aaron really has to look out
for his health, which I mean all of us do,
[SPEAKER_02]: but he especially, he's been really,
really good at hands-on tutorial with like
[SPEAKER_02]: bud washing and making his own solvent
lists and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he really gave me a change of
perspective where he had his three vats,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, he dipped, dipped, dipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end of it, he had,
you know, his plant outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had nice couple pound plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a bubble bag collection at the end
of it through like a 25, 15 or 25 micron.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, cause everybody says like you dip
in, it's going to take away all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: tricones and you know, you're going to
lose all of the material you grew doing
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had barely anything in that 25
micron screen and he washed, he took all
[SPEAKER_02]: of these like 50, it's like probably took
90 gallons of water that he used to wash
[SPEAKER_02]: all those plants with and did a collection
at the end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's only like gunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only stuff in there that you
probably don't want to, don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after seeing that, I was like,
I actually understand this methodology now
[SPEAKER_02]: because like, yeah, it's dirty outside and
there's, with all the smoke and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: ash, bugs, bird doodoo, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's, there's a bunch of
excrements from all these natural insects,
[SPEAKER_02]: natural animals out there that you
probably don't want to be consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually now think of it as a
legitimate answer to dirty flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mind you, it's not going to get rid of
your PM.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to get rid of your aphids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to get rid of your spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you'll wash them off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you should handle that before you
can get into flower or when you get in the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of flower to make sure the last
four to seven weeks, you don't get
[SPEAKER_02]: anything on your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're really concerned about your
health and you do need to, you do want
[SPEAKER_02]: clean flower, then yeah, absolutely wash
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I don't know about residuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't done any residual analysis and
that's the one thing that I would be
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned about because lemon juice is
citric acid, sodium bicarbonate is baking
acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baking soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, I don't know about the
residuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be my question is what I go to like
next in my hierarchy of how I kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: discover these things, my discovery
process and see what the residuals after I
[SPEAKER_02]: go, okay, that's a good process to make
sure my flowers clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what are the residuals on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I still don't have any data on if
there is any residual on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally have never consumed materials
that have been washed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, I can't really say for sure if
it's like, qualitatively good or bad,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know, I can, I can, I guess I can,
I guess what I'm trying to say is I can
[SPEAKER_02]: see it as a method to clean flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know it's outdoor or you have dirty
flower, like actual dirt, dirt,
[SPEAKER_02]: dirty, not like dirty as in like,
Oh, it has but loads of PM on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I remediate this now?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over a lot in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us how can the listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find us on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very present on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I, I run an Instagram page.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at c u l dot t u r dot ed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on Facebook culture biologics.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our own group called culture
growers, where we do like exclusive
[SPEAKER_02]: releases and discount codes and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can also find us.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to find our products,
go to your local store, say hi to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, uh, go medicaid with them,
you know, go, go hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's our old barbershops,
how it used to be back in the day and go
[SPEAKER_02]: ask for our products upon our shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we like to work directly with,
with, with retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to support the stores
that are supporting you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a question or you have a
problem that you don't know the answer to
[SPEAKER_02]: and Google's not helping you go into the
store, those guys will probably help you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of those guys back there are really
cool and they're probably gonna be your
[SPEAKER_02]: best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the other, you know, easy way to
contact us directly is, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to info at cultured biologics.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes to all the executives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so any question you ask us tracking or
anything like that, just say, hi,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, feel free to just shoot us over an
email.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as what we have next, you know,
we just launched the eon fertilizer line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to get, um, into all the
stores and get samples out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a bunch of samples campaign.
[SPEAKER_02]: We launched samples about a month ago and
we already have close to 300 sample kits
[SPEAKER_02]: being sent out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not on top of the samples,
sample kits are sending out to stores and
[SPEAKER_02]: things are going gangbusters right now for
the eon fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you're in hydroponics,
soil, whether you're doing some type of
[SPEAKER_02]: medium between the two, um, check out eon
it's, it's, you know, our organic
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer system that's able to be used
in hydroponics all the way to soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, essentially I like to grow good
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want everybody to grow good medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's, what we're really trying to do
is, is pump this really hard and get this
[SPEAKER_02]: in as many people's hands as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I really do feel like this is the
next evolution in our, how we,
[SPEAKER_02]: how we grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we're going to be refocusing on
this pretty hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, I'm dead set on, on doing things a
little differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, we're just, we're just
cranking away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for all you New Yorkers up in the
Northeast, uh, we're going to be at NYC
[SPEAKER_02]: Canikon, I think the first week of
January, I think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so come check us out and come say hi,
you know, come share the love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
