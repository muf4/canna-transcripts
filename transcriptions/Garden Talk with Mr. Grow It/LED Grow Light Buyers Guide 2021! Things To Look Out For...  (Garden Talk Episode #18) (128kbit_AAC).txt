[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have the light really close to
your canopy, and you don't have this
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amount of infrared spectrum that
like an HBSA would have, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: radiating those plant leaves and just
burning them like a crisp, and you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: not losing the light spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of misconception
where people think adding UV or infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a massive difference, even in small
quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't make a big difference
when you only have a tiny little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light spread is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find a par chart for a light,
kind of a red flag to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant's not going to be able to
accept a high amount of PPFD if your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment is not dialed in, your
nutrients aren't good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to make sure that the
company you're buying from has lab tests
[SPEAKER_00]: done on their fixtures so that you know
that they're not just making these numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of misinformation in the
industry and a lot of manufacturers who
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't afraid to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 18.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Austin from
Chilltech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin has been working for Chilltech for
a year and a half, and he has some
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent knowledge when it comes to LED
grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured he'd be a great person to sit
down with and talk about things to look
[SPEAKER_01]: for when buying an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: A buyer's guide, as some may call it.

[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the episode,
I'd like to give a shout out to our
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Dutch Pro Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Pro sent me over their entire lineup
of nutrients, and I'll be using them in an
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are a plant fertilizer company that
was established in Amsterdam 30 years ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they've been around for quite some
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their nutrients are available in several
countries across the world, and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: everything needed for proper plant
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have different base nutrients,
depending on if you're in soil or cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro, and they also have different base
nutrients if you're using hard water or RO
[SPEAKER_01]: water to really dial things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have pH regulators and additives
such as CalMag, Silica, a PK Booster,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave a link to their Amazon store
down in the description section below for
[SPEAKER_01]: those of you on YouTube, and you can use
discount code MRGROWIT10DP for a discount
[SPEAKER_01]: on their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, we are back here with Austin from
Chilt Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be talking all about
grow lights today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, I wanted this video to be more
about what the consumer should look for
[SPEAKER_01]: when buying a grow light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different things that
people can look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: For somebody who's new to gardening,
just starting to grow indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: making their first grow light purchase or
whatever, there's just so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things that can be, frankly, overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought you would be a perfect fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work for Chilt Tech, a lighting
company, and you talk to customers all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought you would be the perfect
person on this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name's Austin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for Chilt Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working for Chilt Tech since
January of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really before Chilt Tech, I never
really had much growing experience at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my mother, she was someone who
always kind of had a green thumb and I
[SPEAKER_00]: always found it interesting, but
truthfully, I was a gear head and I like
[SPEAKER_00]: building computers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really spend much time in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, starting at Chilt Tech has
really, it's really opened up my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's truthfully, I've learned so much in
this just, you know, it's been about a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and a half and I've kind of developed
a passion for plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: truthfully, all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, I really like pepper
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're really, really fun and
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I love spicy food,
so it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really just I've discovered that the
value of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just been learning more and more every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like you said, I talk with
people all the time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are looking for their new grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a tough industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of misinformation and
marketing that is misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, all these companies,
they really sometimes I feel like focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: the wrong things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hopefully I can help do my best to
explain, you know, because like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk to a lot of people about these
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can go ahead and jump right into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before we actually get into the nitty
gritty of things, Austin's not paying me
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chiltek isn't paying me anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I am affiliated with Chiltek.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a company that I stand by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an affiliate coupon code to where I
get referral fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use code MRGROWIT to get a
percentage off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this month, June, we've got
something special going on, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now, all affiliate codes,
including yours, are worth 10% up from the
[SPEAKER_00]: 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: All affiliates only get 5%, but right now
you're bumped up to 10%, which if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything about Chilt, we don't often offer
that big of a discount for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for coupon codes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not stackable, but right now you can
get that 10%, which will take you down
[SPEAKER_00]: from the already sale price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really a great time to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also leave a link to Chiltek down in the
description section below, along with the
[SPEAKER_01]: coupon code so you can easily navigate to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about grow lights and what
consumers can kind of look for,
[SPEAKER_01]: like ultimate buyer's guide, what people
should be looking for when buying a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes I get the question from people,
you know, as I believe you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd tested grow lights for a year,
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my hands on about 50 different grow
lights and I grew with a handful of them
[SPEAKER_01]: and did part tests and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen a lot of different grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people often come to me and ask me
the question, what is the best grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: That question is kind of difficult to
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like asking, what's the best
TV?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, you want to know what size TV are
you looking for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for a 32 inch, you're
looking for a 50 inch, a 60 inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you find the size,
you can kind of really narrow down what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if you're looking for a
three foot by three foot grow space,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's what you have and you want to
cover that area, you can narrow it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when we talk about coverage,
area light distance as well, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: factoring that in because some of these
grow lights, you have to have them 24
[SPEAKER_01]: inches, 30 inches away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're limited on height,
if you have a height constraint,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a grow tent, for example,
and you got that light all the way up,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, what is 24 inches away and how much
space do you have for your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like coverage area is kind of
like the number one thing that people
[SPEAKER_01]: should kind of understand first,
know first what area you're looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of factoring that light
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really like you said,
it's important to know the desired
[SPEAKER_00]: coverage area first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the biggest things you need
to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes people reach out and go,
what's your best grow light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that depends, you know, they're not
all able to fit in the same grow spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for example, we could say a two by
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our best two by four light is the X3 330.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hanging height for that we suggest
between 12 and 20 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The X3 is 24, but that goes, there's a
step further on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your best hanging height,
it depends on the stage of plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the advantages of GrowCraft is
how close you can get to the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: without worrying about, you know,
losing that light spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, some lights have to be
at at least 24 inches just so that that
[SPEAKER_00]: light can distribute, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas GrowCraft, you know, it fits right
into that two by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: That X3 is just, it's like a glove,
you know, just enough room where it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: touching the walls or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really have a smooth canopy light
distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have to hang the light
really high, which in turn gives you a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: better penetration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you have the light really
close to your canopy and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: this infrared, the massive amount of
infrared spectrum that like an HPSA would
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you're not radiating those plant
leaves and just bring them like a crisp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're also not losing the light
spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my suggestion for people would
be is to, you know, figure out the space
[SPEAKER_00]: that you want to have it in, the
dimensions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically from there,
you can start to determine, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, which size fixture do I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's another factor to look
at, and that's how many watts per square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I suggest getting around 35 to
40 watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hold the standard pretty high at
ShieldTech.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people might compare it to other
lights and see, well, I can spend,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just this little amount and get
this, you know, just have just this amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in reality, these companies,
they've kind of a lot of them stretch how
[SPEAKER_00]: far you can really go with a given amount
of wattage at the efficacy that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we hold the standard
very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, like the X3 330,
for example, in a two by four,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have about 41 watts per square foot,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good for all plants, even those really,
really light hungry ones, tomatoes and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, since it's a dimmable
fixture, you know, you can always dim it
[SPEAKER_00]: down, but to get back to hanging heights,
it really depends on what you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what stage of plant growth you're at,
and the fixture that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of getting into other things
that people look at, PAR, efficacy,
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some other things that people
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's certainly an argument.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people prefer to look at some over
the other as far as importance,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think PAR is more important
than efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, some people say, no,
efficacy, efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then look at PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some people might say, hey,
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum's more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start looking at spectrum first,
then look at PAR, then look at efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: PAR stands for photosynthetically active
radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the energy that the plants use in
order to grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these little balls of energy called
photons, right, that are coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picture them as like rain coming down,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the density of photons or how
fast it's raining, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: can be measured in like a few different
ways, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's PPF and there's PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to explain what those two
measurements are for PAR?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So PPF is photosynthetic photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically the total amount of
light I could say, or I guess you could
[SPEAKER_00]: say total number of photons that a light
fixture outputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically how you can use that
number to determine how much total light a
[SPEAKER_00]: given fixture is giving out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you can look at PPFD,
which is basically the metric you would
[SPEAKER_00]: see like a PAR map shown in, for example,
or you could see, sometimes you'll see
[SPEAKER_00]: like average PPFD in a given space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's photosynthetic photon flux
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the amount of photons in a
given area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say one square foot has
X amount of PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of the difference
between those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, they're both in PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets into a whole different world
where a lot of people aren't familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're not super familiar
with growing or you're just getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or you just really don't know a
whole lot about grow lights in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR is it's basically, yeah, it's like the
you could view it as like the energy
[SPEAKER_00]: raining down onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also I like to explain as the way
that plants see light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's the energy they can use from that
light as opposed to lumens.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will reach out and say,
hey, you know, I have a lumen meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many lumens should I be at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's well, you know, you can kind of
use that a little bit, but that's really,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just how the human eye sees light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so your plant isn't necessarily
interested in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm glad you brought up PAR and
kind of explained PAR because that's half
[SPEAKER_00]: the battle right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some general guidelines for
measurements that you should look for as a
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for PPF, some numbers that I have here,
if you're in a two foot by two foot area,
[SPEAKER_01]: 275 to 300, 375 ends up being in micro
moles per second is the PPF measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three foot by three foot area,
600 to 850 micro moles per second,
[SPEAKER_01]: four foot by four foot area, 1100 to 1500
micro moles per second, five foot by five
[SPEAKER_01]: foot area, 1500 or greater micro moles per
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are just general guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are just general guidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some may watch this and, and I you that,
you know, it's going to be dependent on
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What plant you're growing like Austin,
I had mentioned, but those are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: general guide for what you can look at for
PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when talking about PPFD kind of
narrowing it down, typically 200 to 400
[SPEAKER_01]: PPFD for seedlings, clones and mother
plants, 400 to 600 PPFD for plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation stage, 600 to 900 PPFD for
plants in the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And arguably you can do more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go higher than that if you're
supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, those are just kind of general
ranges that you can go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And looking at the PAR map, there'll be a
lot of companies that have a PAR map on
[SPEAKER_01]: their grow light listings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll tell you at the different distances,
whether it be 12 inches away, the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: lights 12 inches away from the plants,
24 inches away, 30 inches away,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, what those PPFD numbers are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growers often will look at those PAR
maps, kind of get an understanding of the
[SPEAKER_01]: light distance, seeing if it will fit
within their grow tent, knowing that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have their light this far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to give them the adequate
amount of PAR through the different stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the way I kind of look at
it and go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that you mentioned that it's a
general guideline because it varies so
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant genetics, like you mentioned,
plant genetics play a huge role into how
[SPEAKER_00]: much total intensity that it can take at
each stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CO2 is another role, but also your
plant's not going to be able to accept a
[SPEAKER_00]: high amount of PPFD if your environment is
not dialed in, your nutrients aren't good
[SPEAKER_00]: to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another thing that I mentioned
to people when they're trying to pick a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will say, oh, I have a two
by four, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll go, I should just go for the
X3 500 watt, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is kind of our three by five light,
which has a lot more power than even just
[SPEAKER_00]: the 330.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of say to people, unless you
are supplementing CO2, you have everything
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in, you're really not going to be
able to take advantage of the jump from
[SPEAKER_00]: the X3 330 to the X3 500 in a two by four
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got to have things dialed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I say, hold on, slow down a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to have way too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing to consider is that all
of our fixtures are dimmable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can from five, five percent to a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can always adjust that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like I said, it's good that you
say that's kind of a general guideline
[SPEAKER_00]: because it does vary for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of looking at that light
output, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like PPF is a total light output,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But how much is that is actually hitting
the footprint, your coverage area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some people look at the light
spread across the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that they consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take into consideration when
purchasing a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bar style lights that Chill has,
for example, has excellent light spread
[SPEAKER_01]: across the entire canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get some other grow lights where
it's very focused in the dead center of
[SPEAKER_01]: the footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might have 900 PPFD in the dead
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you see on the part chart or some
companies actually hide their part chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just show that dead center number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you kind of go away from the dead
center of the footprint, the light drops
[SPEAKER_01]: off considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at 900 dead center,
but it might be like 200 in the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a light spread evenly across the
footprint is another thing to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: when looking at lights, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light spread is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned before, one of the
advantages of GrowCraft and having the bar
[SPEAKER_00]: design is yeah, that spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and the ability to hang it lower
without losing that spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, if you have 1,000 PPFD in
the center, but 200 on the edges,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get not a very great yield
on those edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have a lot of,
I guess you'd call it LARF, or really just
[SPEAKER_00]: like undergrown stuff, because it's not
getting the intensity that it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have a really uneven
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you'll notice with some
other style lights, the more spotlight,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you would, lights or quantum boards and
stuff, is when you have this centralized
[SPEAKER_00]: area in the center that's way more
powerful, your canopy becomes very uneven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your center,
your canopy is getting all tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then your edges are short.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes that even worse, where the
center is just getting more and more light
[SPEAKER_00]: and the outsides are not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, again, light spread, very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, some companies will
actually kind of hide their part charts,
[SPEAKER_00]: which to me, deal breaker for me,
because you've got to have not only tests
[SPEAKER_00]: done by the company, but also third party
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to send our fixtures to as many
people as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We give them the light and say,
hey, check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Test it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we want to get people's genuine
test results, because we're confident that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've really narrowed it down and gotten
that light spread to be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, light spread is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find a part chart for a
light, kind of a red flag to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we obviously offer part charts for all
of our fixtures, but also there's plenty
[SPEAKER_00]: of third party testing that's been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a company hit me up last week,
and they sent me a picture of their grow
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, we're looking for
somebody to test it or promote the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started asking them other
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, so what's the PAR at the
different levels?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no PAR chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, what's PAR?
Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The conversation ended pretty quickly
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, get out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's PAR?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different companies on the
market today that you just dig into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: do your due diligence, make sure they know
what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's people at these companies
and lights that are out there that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just hot garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people working for those companies
don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to go with a company that
actually knows what they're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty scary not knowing what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But moving on to efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So efficacy is essentially, in layman's
terms, how efficiently a grow light can
[SPEAKER_00]: take input wattage and turn it into usable
PAR, which is what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most important
specifications or metrics that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: look at for a grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you could have 1,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have an efficacy below,
let's say, one micromole per joule,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not really getting a whole lot of
output in terms of what your plants can
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you have a low efficacy and a
high input wattage, you're losing a lot to
[SPEAKER_00]: heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing a lot of energy to heat,
which heat is basically almost every
[SPEAKER_00]: grower's worst enemy, unless you're
somewhere that's extremely cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally, you never really want to
have your 1,000 watts being turned into a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So efficacy is one thing that we put a lot
of focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We strive to have the most efficacious
light in basically every regard,
[SPEAKER_00]: in every single grow craft fixture that we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recently, we actually launched the
pre-orders for GrowCraft Ultra,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, Chris, I know you've checked it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the GrowCraft Ultra,
which is our ultra-efficient fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically takes the GrowCraft fixture,
which is already great, and it takes
[SPEAKER_00]: things up a notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's done through making sure we
have the highest quality components
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and having more diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically, an X3 330 on the Ultra
has 4,100 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 3,404 diodes, which is quite a
few.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys who have paid attention to
grow light technology, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: unheard of to have a three-bar light
fixture with only 330 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what that does is it basically
drives down the wattage per diode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that, it actually
increases the efficacy of the diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they run cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we have these over-built heat
sinks, they run even cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they run very efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that leads to is basically
minimizing the amount of input wattage you
[SPEAKER_00]: need, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone wants to reduce electrical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, what you could compare
it to is we have our X3 500-watt standard
[SPEAKER_00]: GrowCraft, and we have an X3 330 Ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that Ultra is producing similar total
PPF to the X3 500-watt, but obviously uses
[SPEAKER_00]: less wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the cost is higher because the cost
for us is a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using the absolute highest possible
bin and best diodes on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're hard to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very hard to get, especially right
now with all the shortages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that cost is a cost that we have to
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that I think is worth
it because we're pushing the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and really showing what is
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the X3 330 Ultra with a 3.19 micromole
per joule efficacy is the highest lab test
[SPEAKER_00]: ever to date so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the standard GrowCraft lights,
they're not far away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this jump, it takes a lot to get to,
but really just shows what's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having a high efficacy is very
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we strive to have that in
all fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we even hit that record with the
Ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean the standard
GrowCraft has a low efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still class leading.
[SPEAKER_00]: The X6 600-watt standard GrowCraft,
for example, at full power has a 2.81
[SPEAKER_00]: micromole per joule efficacy, which you
can kind of look around at other grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's backed by lab tests, which is
another thing that's really, really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to make sure that the
company you're buying from has lab tests
[SPEAKER_00]: done on their fixtures so that you know
that they're not just making these numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, there's a lot of
misinformation in the industry and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of manufacturers who aren't afraid to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not something that Chill does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something I would ever support.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just make sure you pay attention to the
efficacy and you make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture has a high efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you're making the most of that
wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So efficacy measurement, like you
mentioned, micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're looking at the grow light
listing, you'll see U-M-O-L slash J for
[SPEAKER_01]: joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the U is actually a symbol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a U, but it's actually,
it stands for micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a symbol that stands for micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So micromole per joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in 2021, I think many can agree that
anything under 2.0 micromoles per joule is
[SPEAKER_01]: not efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where way beyond that, I think average
what I usually see 2.7, 2.8, or even
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond that, micromole per joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people consider efficacy like the
number one thing you look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look at that before they even look at
the PAR numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or again, like I mentioned, some people
look at PAR, they prioritize PAR over
[SPEAKER_01]: efficacy, but there's neck and neck there
as far as what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum is another big thing that people
look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the spectrum chart with all the
colors going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum is very important, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we offer under standard grow
craft, two spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the flower slash full cycle
spectrum or the veg spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I have a lot of people that will
ask, which one should I get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one's for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be able to go from seed to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the flower slash full
cycle spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is that spectrum,
from the white diodes alone, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 20% blue spectrum already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it veg is really quite well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also have that advantage of when
you hit flower, you've got plenty of red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's a really well balanced
spectrum that's just geared towards
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's been fine tuned over many
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilled was started in 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Vitale has been messing with LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's our founder for a long time and has
basically found out the best recipe for a
[SPEAKER_00]: single channel light that really does
everything great and performs very well in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get the veg spectrum,
that spectrum has more blue, or I guess it
[SPEAKER_00]: focuses on 450 nanometer blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you lose a little bit of far red
with the 660 nanometer in exchange for
[SPEAKER_00]: more blue, which in vegetative growth,
or if you have leafy greens, like lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that, they prefer more of a
blue spectrum to help, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: overall lateral lateral growth,
you know, keep that internal spacing very
[SPEAKER_00]: tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, you know, just overall some
slight improvements when you go for veg
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum for vegetative growth,
but it's not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: With those two spectrums, we also are
going to be releasing our guardian system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows people to add spectrum bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those spectrum bars, they add UV,
infrared, a little bit more deep red and
[SPEAKER_00]: far red, and more 450 nanometer,
450 nanometer blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allows you to do is to
manipulate the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because first of all, not all plant
genetics like the exact same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them prefer more blue spectrum or
more red spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you have a very tall plant
that's just growing very stretchy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you can do is use more blue spectrum
to help kind of tighten it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: get those nodes to grow a little tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not have such a tall lanky plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that I think a lot of
people enjoy to play with and really get
[SPEAKER_00]: to mess with the morphology of a plant,
which I think is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, not required.
[SPEAKER_00]: The standard GrowCraft full cycle slash
flower spectrum has been fine tuned for
[SPEAKER_00]: seed to harvest growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of our commercial growers
currently use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as you've probably seen
with a lot of the pictures on our
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram and stuff, it's got great
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really kicking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people would be very
satisfied with that spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I don't have too much to add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You covered just about everything there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do want to highlight the blue
spectrum for the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue light inhibits cell division.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what causes the tighter node
spacing on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people prefer that for medicinal
varieties, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have these long,
stretchy, lengthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll have a higher blue spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now typically, what I've been told is
between 15 to 20% blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, unfortunately, you're not going to be
able to look at, companies don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise what percentage the different
colors are, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you can't just look at the power
map, I'm sorry, the spectrum chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: see that there's a blue spike and you
can't tell what percent blue is no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: how big the spike is or no matter how it
looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can probably reach out to manufacturer
and maybe ask them what percentage of blue
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I consider that definitely one of the
more important things when talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing I want to add about
spectrum is you will see a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies without naming names that will
add UV like a diode or two or add infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: in a diode or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a small amount just so that
they can say that their spectrum includes
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of misconception
where people think adding UV or infrared
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a massive difference, even in small
quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, it really doesn't make a big
difference when you only have a tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you see companies that add
just like one diode of UV, don't be
[SPEAKER_00]: fooled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a small amount that's kind of
even hard to see on a spectrograph if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a reader to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So make sure if you have UV included that
you look at the spectrograph and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can actually see it, especially
if it's backed by lab data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry too much about having just
a diode or two of UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't make as big of a difference
as having the proper spectrum overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are going to be some people out
there, like some lighting scientists
[SPEAKER_01]: actually say that photons are photons,
you know, and the spectrum is very little
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to hear a lot of different
things depending on who you talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, we could get in deeper
on UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get into green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could get into IR, but that's really
probably best suited for a different
[SPEAKER_01]: video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start talking about plant growth and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more of like a buyer's guide on
what you should look for on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but yeah, that spectrum is another
thing to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I don't see on many
grow light listings anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I used to like four or five
years ago is CRI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about CRI?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CRI is, is the color rendering index.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically how accurately a
light source can represent natural color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with that, there's also, you know,
color temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can get a little confusing and
there's even been some considerations of
[SPEAKER_00]: using a different metric for LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause LEDs have, have gotten so,
you know, so, um, accurate with color and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's such a wide range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the funny things is that grow
craft actually has approximately a 93 CRI,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a hundred being, uh, you know,
it's perfectly represents what color or
[SPEAKER_00]: something would look like under natural
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, uh, with that, w you know,
as opposed to something like a blur pole
[SPEAKER_00]: or some of the other things, like the
other lights, uh, your, your plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to look, you're going to be able to
see things on it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's just under the
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so you can really see, you know,
what's going on on the leaves or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you have any weird growth,
maybe some, some powdery mildew or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that, um, that, you know,
you want to be aware of right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so having a high CRI kind of a side
benefit, uh, that grow craft does have,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, as opposed to, you know, like,
uh, you could have compared to a bad
[SPEAKER_00]: example is, or I guess a good example is
a, is a blur pole light, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, if you've ever worked under a blur
pole light is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fun because it's, first of all,
it's not very good for your eyes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also, you can't really see it and
it has a low CRI because, uh, we don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: the world in blur pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, CRI isn't something I really
even look at, but, uh, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting that you say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think probably we don't see it as in
many listings is because a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: lights are white light LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you think that that would probably
be the case why people don't mention CRI
[SPEAKER_01]: as much anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think CRI is just something that's
more focused on for the photography
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're, you're, it's more of a
selling point for something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you're working with, you know,
any sort of color correction or,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, making sure that things are
represented appropriately, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, that's something that's more for,
for like making a movie or taking pictures
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, it's a side benefit of a grow
light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's not something that's critical,
but you could also assume that if
[SPEAKER_00]: something has a high CRI, um, it probably
is pretty accurate to what sunlight is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what sunlight actually looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where plants grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, originally plants, you know,
started growing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having a high CRI kind of
indicates, yeah, you have a more white
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum or, uh, accurate to this,
what sunlight is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 10 years ago, it was all about Watts,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 600 Watts for a four by four thousand
Watts for a five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was what people shopped by.
[SPEAKER_01]: They shopped by Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not really the case anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we moved over to LEDs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Watts is a measurement of energy
consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take that number and you can
actually use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as you have a kilowatt per
hour from your electricity company,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually figure out what your
electricity bill would be by doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: calculation there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's mostly what people use Watts
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really use it these days as an
intensity factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you mentioned the Watts per square
foot earlier, but you know, really Watts
[SPEAKER_01]: is still being misused a lot these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's no longer, you don't really
need 600 Watts in a four by four anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with 400, 450 Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these grow lights and it depends
on efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of goes back to the,
the efficacy we talked about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How efficient is the grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else do people need to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, there's a lot of
misconceptions on wattage and,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, how much wattage you really
need just depends on that efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, we still use our,
like our X six, for example, which is our
[SPEAKER_00]: best four by four light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We offer it in a 600 watt four that we
suggest for, for flowering a four by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's not required to have
600 Watts, even with a high efficacy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it certainly helps, you know,
having a high wattage with a high efficacy
[SPEAKER_00]: means you're really able to push the
plants hard and back to kind of like a
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing CO2 with our X six,
600 watt in a four by four, you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're probably going to want to have CO2
to really get the most out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or else you're going to end up probably
having to dim your light, um, without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can stretch an X six,
600 watt to a five by five with no
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's 600 Watts these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, having a 2.81 micro mole per
joule efficacy really makes the most of
[SPEAKER_00]: each watt and back to the ultra.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pushes that even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use our X three, three 30 watt
ultra, which, you know, does come at a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use that in a four by four
though, and get great results and still
[SPEAKER_00]: have a good, you know, average PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Across the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, wattage has really changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but one thing to also consider is that
all grow lights and their efficacy is not
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot compare, um, the wattage you
might find on this model to the wattage on
[SPEAKER_00]: this model.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay attention to back to,
you know, making sure you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: wattage, the efficacy, the total PPF,
um, the total P the average PPFD across
[SPEAKER_00]: the growth space that you want to use it
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, basically you have to use all those
factors to figure out which light will be
[SPEAKER_00]: best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are growing, um,
in this desired stage that you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, wattage is, it's,
we're definitely seeing a decline in the
[SPEAKER_00]: need for a high input wattage,
but also at the same time, increasing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, total output, you know, as opposed to
like a thousand watt HPS, which yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you needed a thousand Watts to cover a
five by five, um, you know, effectively,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, not anymore, but we're
definitely bringing down that wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like you had mentioned,
even if you're putting a 600 watt,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the chill, 600 Watts in a full by
four, you can always dim it down if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have that CO2 supplementation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's features is another thing to look
at, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend you get a dimmer on
your grow light these days, just because
[SPEAKER_01]: you have that flexibility to, um,
reduce the amount of energy you're
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming, therefore reducing your
electricity bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you are even be able to get the light
closer to your plants if you're dimming it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it helps when you talk about light
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just adds flexibility having a
dimmer in there, you know, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: feature to, to potentially look at
detached driver is another thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of these grow lights, chilled grow
lights, you can actually put the driver,
[SPEAKER_01]: which produces heat outside of your grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you're hiding,
if you're having in the grow tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that heat that's generated from the
driver, it's not going into your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have that, or you have fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, some companies will have the
driver mounted to the actual fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that produces heat increases
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a potential feature to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a heat is a concern for you,
120 volts to 40 volt, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something else you got to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what features do you think that
consumers should be looking at these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, I, I don't think I would
really even want to grow light without a
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmer just because, uh, maybe it's just
cause I'm so used to how nice it is having
[SPEAKER_00]: the chilled grow cuff lights with a dimmer
because, uh, you never know what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, truthfully, you could be growing
this one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next time you want to do this or,
you know, your plants might need different
[SPEAKER_00]: intensities based on their genetics or,
uh, you know, you change your light,
[SPEAKER_00]: your distance or, you know, your grow
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice to be able to, uh,
you know, change the dimming or grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this isn't, you know, the,
the meanwhile drivers that we use,
[SPEAKER_00]: we use the 48 B, um, is the last,
you know, uh, serial numbers of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the meanwhile drivers we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these have an external dimmer and we
have a dimmer pot or potentiometer that
[SPEAKER_00]: has a very smooth five to 100% intensity
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can really use,
you can use the light for really anything
[SPEAKER_00]: at any stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or if, you know, you, you need to,
for whatever reason, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of reduce your, your heat
temporarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can kind of reduce, reduce the
intensity while you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say you're AC broke or something
like that, but you want to keep the light
[SPEAKER_00]: on its light schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can do that and reduce the dim,
get the heat down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that kind of goes into
another thing too, uh, is, is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: having that, that driver, you can put the
driver in the tent if you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say it's winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and where you live, it gets very,
very cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, with the reduced heat output
of led versus HPS that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be used to, uh, you know,
you may need that heat and so you can put
[SPEAKER_00]: the driver in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, like you said, you can remove it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We include with all of our grow craft
fixtures, both DIY kit and the prebuilt
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial, a seven foot extension that
goes from the driver to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have six and a half feet
from the wall plug to the fixture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can also always come back to our
site and get more of that extension cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't typically suggest going over
21 feet from the driver to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause then you have to start worrying
about, uh, you know, losing wattage and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically we suggest 21 feet,
which gives you plenty of room to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, matter on the wall outside of
your room or, um, put, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people would just put it on top
of the grow tent or just on the floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: not really anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can remove that heat, which is to
me is an awesome feature that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: girl lights miss out on, you know,
you you'll see, especially quantum boards,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see, they have the driver mounted
to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so there's not really the ability
to remove that heat, but also not having
[SPEAKER_00]: the driver on top of the fixture reduces
the heat of the grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned before, uh,
you know, essentially a cool diode or a
[SPEAKER_00]: chill diode is a happy diode and one that
lasts longer, but also can be more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacious.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, having that external removable
driver, it's excellent feature that I
[SPEAKER_00]: think, um, a lot of people have other
companies should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting into drivers, diodes, the
components of the fixture, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of people put a lot of
emphasis on that, you know, diodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: Samsung, we've got Osram, Cree,
BridgeLux, Epistar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many different dial brands
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drivers, you got Meanwell, Inventronics,
uh, Sosan, there's on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us some advice about what people
should look for when it comes to looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the diodes, looking at the drivers,
the components of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the diodes is obviously one that a lot
of people pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, with chilled,
we don't publicly disclose the exact model
[SPEAKER_00]: number, but I can tell you, you know,
for the, for the white chips, we use top
[SPEAKER_00]: bin Samsung's, um, basically the highest
that you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we don't disclose the reds,
but if you look at the numbers in the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: results, it's very, it becomes very clear,
especially to someone who's experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: with grow lights that we must be using the
best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to achieve those numbers, we have to
be using the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we, you know, with the diodes,
there's also the drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's kind of two main manufacturers
that you should look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's Meanwell, which, uh,
you know, typically is the most efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's Inventronics,
which is also a pretty efficient and good
[SPEAKER_00]: brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's, there's many other side
brands with kind of no names, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't speak on directly, but, um,
don't always have the best reliability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I typically would suggest looking for a
Meanwell or Inventronics driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we use Meanwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use one of their most efficient
drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, has that, you know, it's a little
bit more expensive, but has that external
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmer that we connect the dimmer pot to,
um, for that really smooth, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: dimming zero, zero to, or five to a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also another thing that I want to hit
on is basically the overall build quality
[SPEAKER_00]: of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that surprises a lot of
people when they first get their,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, GrowCraft Lite, they're absolutely
blown away by the build quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that it's something that we
have an offer that a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_00]: don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really having a really robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strong, sturdy, American made,
good looking, uh, structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our U-frames are actually made locally
in Arlington, just down the road from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're powder coated the other way
down the road, um, in Arlington,
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's such a high quality piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's hard to see over pictures and
videos, um, just how sturdy and solid
[SPEAKER_00]: these things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have those really, really nice
overbuilt aluminum heat sinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they just, the build quality is
off and referred to as like an aerospace
[SPEAKER_00]: grade, which I totally agree with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, actually I heard that from a,
from a customer one time and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's, that is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does look like it's aircraft grade,
you know, it's built really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never have to worry about dropping
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I don't suggest dropping it,
but, uh, a while back, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: later last year we released a video,
just kind of a funny spoof video where we
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped, uh, you know, dropped a GrowCraft
Lite off of a ladder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And truth be told, that did happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it many times because there was
multiple cuts and this thing was still
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problems at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't suggest it again, but,
uh, it was totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cause of that really,
really strong structure that I think a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of other companies miss out on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they, these are kind of
some of the spots will cheap out on is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is, uh, it's the build quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't, you don't want to flimsy
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we, we, we spend a little more
time and research and development and it
[SPEAKER_00]: costs a little more, but we've created a
fixture that, um, has replaceable parts as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so basically you, if let's say you had
a PCB go bad or for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you actually hit it with something
and, and, you know, broke, broke a diode
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always pop in a new PCB.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell these on our site, uh,
you know, for very reasonable costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even offer B grade, which is just,
they're just slightly scratched,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no physical damage or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's another part of build
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's very important is just
having a very, very sturdy light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to last you a long time uses,
you know, like I said, top bin Samsung's
[SPEAKER_00]: and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really just the best styles in the market,
having that good driver, having the
[SPEAKER_00]: external dimmer, um, all those kinds of
things I think are very important to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And paying a little extra for that stuff,
I think is, is worth it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of getting into the price prices
can vary so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're looking at for a four foot
by four foot coverage area, lights ranging
[SPEAKER_01]: from $700 all the way up to like $1,400
for some light, something even more than
[SPEAKER_01]: that for that particular coverage area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So prices can range like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to be one of the things
that folks look at, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, one of the things that chill does,
which I thought was pretty interesting on
[SPEAKER_01]: your website, you list a couple of
measurements for price, things that
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers can look at, which is price per
watt and price per micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the price per watt is one that I
typically steer away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people, especially some of
the more old school people, they really
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on that price per watt back to
wattage being more important previously
[SPEAKER_00]: than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, wattage is not what you should
be focusing on because truthfully,
[SPEAKER_00]: a high end, high efficient grow light
doesn't need as much input wattage as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you start looking at the dollar per
watt and things can get a little weird
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're like, well, this,
this light shows that it outputs this much
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF, but it has much lower wattage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the dollar per watt, you know,
is, is can be messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I prefer to look at, you know,
dollar per micromole, which is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that I think that we, we do very
well in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because having a high efficacy
and, you know, having that respectable
[SPEAKER_00]: wattage number, basically your,
your main focus is micromoles because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what your plant is using.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's using those photons, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To see, you know, what, what the,
the total, you know, light output is you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically, that's what you're focused on
is making sure your plant gets the light
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs at as cheap of a cost as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all that being said, you know,
you've, we've been through everything
[SPEAKER_01]: there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've, you look to buy coverage area for
the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make sure that the light distance is
going to fix a fit within your gross space
[SPEAKER_01]: par efficacy spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watts features.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've narrowed down the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: You found your fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd buy the fixture in a junk cell
within six months and you realize that the
[SPEAKER_01]: warranty only lasts five months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So warranty is definitely something.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm getting at is warranty is another
thing you should be looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we'll wrap it up there as far as
warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some companies are going to just going to
give you a one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got one year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the fixture burns on you after that,
it's on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some companies that do a three year,
but if some of the components burn out
[SPEAKER_01]: after a year, you got to pay for the
components.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pay for shipping or something
along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have some that have a full
warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three years, full warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll do the fixture back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as shipping costs, they'll pay for
the components.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people have the five year
warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are many different warranties and
it varies by LED grill light company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk to us a little bit
about warranty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Warranty is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our DIY kits are cheaper fixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to assemble yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a one year parts warranty,
which is kind of unheard of for a DIY
[SPEAKER_00]: product to offer that because the assembly
is in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We essentially give you parts kind of like
Legos and then are saying, if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: problem with parts within a year,
we will cover, you know, if you're in the
[SPEAKER_00]: States, we'll cover shipping both ways
and, you know, we'll pay for the return
[SPEAKER_00]: part and you'll be basically up and
running typically, you know, around a
[SPEAKER_00]: week.
[SPEAKER_00]: We basically, from the time you email in
saying, Hey, I had a bad PCB or one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: dials is out or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you have a faulty, meanwhile driver,
we basically will send you a new one
[SPEAKER_00]: within a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're very, very big on that
because, you know, us all being growers
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, we understand that the more
time that your grow light is down,
[SPEAKER_00]: the worse it can be, especially,
you know, if you're any, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you're growing really any plant,
I guess, but especially like a medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, having that grow light go
down could, could cost you your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your harvest, which is not something you
want to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to have a grow light go
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wait, you know, a long time for
a warranty or you got to send the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: thing out and basically have it repaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we'll send you parts out right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the commercial GrowCraft fixtures have
a three year warranty, which allows you
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability if you have any problems with
the light at all, you can send the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light back to us and we will fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the turnaround is pretty quick,
you know, under a month for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can basically have a problem,
reach out to us, send us the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We fix it, send it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also we do again, back to
understanding that, you know, the longer
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow light is down, the worse we
allow you the ability to just have parts
[SPEAKER_00]: sent to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are willing to send parts, cover
shipping again with your, if you're within
[SPEAKER_00]: the States and you know, you can basically
just swap out the part and you're good to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The GrowCraft fixtures, they're very easy
to work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that we really focused on
was the modularity and the ability to just
[SPEAKER_00]: basically swap parts out quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, you just can't have your
grow light go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not something anyone wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can lose a whole harvest because of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, three year warranty on the
commercial fixtures, one year parts
[SPEAKER_00]: warranty on the DIY.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we don't, there's no sort of
fine print in that warranty where a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: companies they'll offer a three year
warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after the first year, you have to
cover shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, both ways, or you have
to start covering the labor costs to fix
[SPEAKER_00]: it after two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a problem and it's,
you know, it's been two years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we treat you as if you just got the
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we don't, we don't play any
games with you on the warranty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we're very quick about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, we have one main location and it's
in Arlington, Washington in the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you don't have to wait for this
to go overseas or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always, you can almost always
call us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if we don't answer, you can shoot us
an email and we typically respond within
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 hours, even on the weekends when we're
not in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always checking and making sure
everyone's taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot us a DM too, if you want on any of
our social media, you know, chilled grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and we'll take care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're, we're here to help people
and we're growers and we basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: try to provide the best experience we can
possible when it comes to warranty because
[SPEAKER_00]: no one likes warranty claims no matter
what the product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fun to have a problem and we make
sure we make that as easy and as quick as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, definitely, definitely look at
that so you don't get screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we covered a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I, uh, before we,
when I got this idea for the video and
[SPEAKER_01]: when I contact you, I'm like, man,
this is going to be a good video where
[SPEAKER_01]: things are going to be explained so easily
and people are going to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be all smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking back, what we just recorded,
there's a lot of things to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: When purchasing a grow light and there are
people that are going to leave this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation still confused and still not
know which way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I feel like I'm bad at
explaining, but, um, I always just try to
[SPEAKER_00]: suggest people to just reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love talking about it and
I'll, as you can see, I'll just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: talking and talking and talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but it's cause I just genuinely enjoy
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's so much misinformation
and people are misled so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I really just want to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you, at the end of our
conversation, you don't end up buying our
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've helped, you know,
I've done my part and that's kind of our
[SPEAKER_00]: whole mission with chilled is,
um, to not just, just sell lights and turn
[SPEAKER_00]: a profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, um, from the beginning,
Vitaly's mission has always been to
[SPEAKER_00]: educate people, help drive a better,
a more sustainable, efficient future,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really just get people into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want anyone to feel
intimidated with growing because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: too much information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so please, you know, always just reach
out to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I said, even if you're not buying
something, let's talk, let's, let's figure
[SPEAKER_00]: it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's figure out what's best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we'll make it as easy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can the listeners find you and what
is chill tech have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So listeners could find, you know,
me and chilled really all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we try to be on all sorts of
social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Twitter, you know, uh, Facebook,
Instagram, you know, at chilled grow
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, you can find us on YouTube,
chilled grow lights, um, email service at
[SPEAKER_00]: chilled grow lights.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me all over the place there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're even in the, uh,
ocean grown discord and, uh, we hope to
[SPEAKER_00]: expand even further as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, I don't have to wear so
many hats, you know, cause right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, my focus is kind of all over the place
and, uh, I try to be as many places as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, but hopefully that'll expand
even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the things that we have coming up,
if you guys haven't seen already,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our guardian system coming out and
that system includes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a touch screen, a controller, uh,
spectrum bars, which add, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that UV infrared, deep red, far red,
more blue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these sensors that we're
going to be having, we're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to have CO2 sensors,
um, PAR sensors, all sorts of sensors to
[SPEAKER_00]: basically automate as much as you can with
your grow and monitor things and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to data log.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then with that, we also have our
ultra, our chilled, uh, grow craft ultra
[SPEAKER_00]: fixtures that are coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those, again, those are kind of a more
of a limited run there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could view them as kind of our,
our super car, if you would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you want one of those,
definitely hop in and pre-order one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but those will be coming in the
future, but we, we plan to stick with the
[SPEAKER_00]: current grow craft design for awhile.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may expand here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but mostly our focus is to keep
building upon what is already great and
[SPEAKER_00]: already there, um, as opposed to replacing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, what's there is truly
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this guardian system and stuff
like that will really just help,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, elevate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want spectrum control or you're
interested in any of that, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely head to our YouTube channel
and, you know, check out some of our
[SPEAKER_00]: explanation videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but also we're going to have a lot
more content on that soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, you know, I could
potentially come back on the show when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all done and fully released and not
just pre-order and kind of maybe show you
[SPEAKER_00]: or talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe someday, you know, we could
potentially hook you up with a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will leave a link to the chill tech
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below, and also link the chill
tech website down in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Section along with the coupon code.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mr. Grow, it's going to give you 10%
off this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every other month it's just 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're watching this in June,
2021, head on over there for that 10% for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd love to know in the comment
section of you guys watching, what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: look for when it comes to buying a grow
light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we went over a whole bunch of things
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, did we miss anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything that you consider a
higher priority?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let us know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Austin, thank you so much for coming onto
the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Chris.
