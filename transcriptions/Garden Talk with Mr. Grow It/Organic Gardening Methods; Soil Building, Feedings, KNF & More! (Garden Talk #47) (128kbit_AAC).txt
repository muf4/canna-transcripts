[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can strengthen anything from trichomes
to stems to your leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It strengthens everything on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie, I always follow the
directions on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's an already mixed inert soil,
I mean it's really rare for something to
[SPEAKER_00]: be too hot to handle a seedling or a
clone, or really anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just open up the lid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'll be condensation, there'll be
moisture, and you put your hand in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, it's actually going to be warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta wait another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth every dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly suggest if you guys are into
organic growing in any capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, outdoor, grab one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather that it got disturbed and
replenished than nothing happening at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a better option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing nothing is never the right idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 47.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Green
Lantern.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 13 years and
grows plants such as bamboo, house plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants, bonsai trees,
and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks about a variety
of organic gardening methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, he talks about building
soil, feeding organic amendments,
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF, IPM, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.

[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening, all plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Green Lantern.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get right into things
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got so much to talk about,
so much good stuff to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into mixing soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into a little bit into
KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: So action packed episode that we have
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, what I usually do with all the
guests is introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my name is Green Lantern,
or Jacob is my real name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got into gardening a long while back
just as something fun to do, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoyed the medicinal properties
of the medical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first, it was just because it was
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then years later, I had a lot of back
issues happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had car accidents, and I was overweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back got all messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And formed an S in my spine, and they call
that sublaxation scoliosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started using it medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got way more interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started doing crazy amounts of research
with Green Goblin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Green Goblin, he's been on the
channel before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people loved that episode we had with
him because he was just spitting off a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of knowledge when it comes to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right there by his side,
growing in the same garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to hear a lot of good
techniques today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, let's start with mixing soil
because I know you have a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: information about mixing soil in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to us, what's in your mix and how
do you mix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So our mix has kind of been building over
almost a decade now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally it started off with maybe a
few pro mix bales from back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started adding, you know,
everything that one would need to add to
[SPEAKER_00]: build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got sphagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started doing large pieces of perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we switched to high porosity clay
pellets in rice holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we just started messing
around with different blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, at this point right now,
I'd say everything in there is sphagnum,
[SPEAKER_00]: the clay pellets, and compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the ratios of each?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talk about clay pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that we don't really hear
people using much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about why the clay
pellets and then also the kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios of each of the things that you have
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're doing like a 30-20 mix,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 30% sphagnum peat moss,
20% compost manures, and 20% other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which might be, you know, your rice hulls
and your clay pellets, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started doing rice hulls a while back
because they add a lot of benefit to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only problem we had with that is
it doesn't affect drainage as much as we
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they break down pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for something to stay
in your mix a little bit longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: the clay pellets will give you that
advantage as well as add a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: silica to your mix, which helps with so
many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like Dr. Bruce was talking about on
the last podcast, it can strengthen
[SPEAKER_00]: anything from trichomes to stems to your
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, pretty much it strengthens
everything on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the compost you mentioned,
you said 20% compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips in regards to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that could be different types of
compost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and honestly, I suggest using
whatever is the most readily available in
[SPEAKER_00]: your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer mushroom compost, but if you
can't find mushroom compost, I'm seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: booze blend compost in a lot of hydro
shops and grow shops in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even seen it in Home Depot before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And booze blend is just a solid compost
that you don't have to worry about too
[SPEAKER_00]: many things with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sourcing of where the materials came from,
or maybe it possibly having too much
[SPEAKER_00]: backguano that was sourcing correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no issues with it that I've
personally come across with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I see booze blend, I'll probably
grab that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I see mushroom compost somewhere,
I would 100% much, much rather get the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you have your 30-20-20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you adding any additional
amendments in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people will do blends,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So build a soil is infamous for their
craft blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Green Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have Earth Dust nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have a mixture that you initially
blend in with your initial mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any additional amendments on top
of what you had just mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What me and Green Goblin usually do there
is build a soil craft blend, like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not around, we'll use a Dr.
Earth blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much same idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same stuff's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different name brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it at Home Depot and some
hydro shops around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a couple different ingredients and
in different ratios that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: preferable for organic growing,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in a pinch, and that's the
stuff that's around, it's going to do you
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I prefer to use the craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we use... I got to change the
measurements in my head now because we
[SPEAKER_00]: switched the way we mix our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like seven gallons that fits in the
mixer, rather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like two and a half cups of that
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll add some frass sometimes or
silica if we notice that the last round
[SPEAKER_00]: had issues with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll add more compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll add... It depends on what's going on
with the last cycle.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as like ratios, specific ratios,
I know we have a lot of folks that are
[SPEAKER_01]: tuning in that, you know, more on the
beginner side, they kind of want to know
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitty gritty details about the exact
ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally use about one cup per plant
for the build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what it says on their
instructions on their website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a third cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always follow the directions on the
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good baseline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either it's going to be maybe a little bit
too much or maybe a little bit too less.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start with that baseline in the
instructions that they've given you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be generally right around
where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can adjust from there based
off from your needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your particular cultivars of said
strain just need way more nitrogen than
[SPEAKER_00]: other strains that you've had or they need
way more potassium or whatever's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can start minutely changing a few
different things in amounts of ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use to mitigate those things for
maybe the next round or even top dressing
[SPEAKER_00]: on your current round of medicinal plants
or any plants to get the desired result
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been using, you mentioned
insect grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used that in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also alfalfa meal is another thing I've
used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes I start off with the bagged
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil is
local to me as far as I'm able to pick it
[SPEAKER_01]: up locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll start with the Fox Farm Ocean
Forest Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually been times where I
mixed in insect grass and alfalfa meal
[SPEAKER_01]: into the ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a lot of people raising their
eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, Ocean Forest, it's already
too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should never be adding anything more
than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're burning your seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're ruining your plants, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually got a really good result.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started in one gallon
containers, Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: put some insect grass in there and alfalfa
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some really, really good results off
of that first vegetation stage in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously nutrients deplete over time and
I had to top dress in, add more nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in, which actually we're going to get into
that next here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I think people get a little
confused with this terminology of a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: blend maybe possibly being too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, if the blend has already been
mixed and it's in a bag like Fox Farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's an inert mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been mixed already.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hotness that we're referring to in a
hot mix is literally a temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll reach your hand into your soil mix
and it's 20, 30, 40 degrees warmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do this in a tent out in the
backyard or a tarp rather out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard in the winter, you'll see actual
steam coming off from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're talking about when we
say we got to cook this soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you were to use that soil during
that process, that mix is literally too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's physically too hot and nutrients are
absolutely too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything is just bioactively readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as you plant a seed into
something like that or a clone into
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, you're definitely
going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's an already mixed inert soil,
I mean, it's really rare for something to
[SPEAKER_00]: be too hot to handle a seedling or a clone
or really anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you do that initial mixing that
you mentioned, you're letting it cook for
[SPEAKER_01]: a little while, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what time period are you letting,
how long are you letting this cook for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing it in batches of about
30 gallons, which I would recommend,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to mix a soil,
do at least 30 gallons because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to make more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For about 30 gallons, a good cook time
would be about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good way to check this is,
you know, a weekend, open up a,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's in a, I use trash cans,
I use 35 gallon trash cans, heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just open up the lid, there'll be
condensation, there'll be moisture,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you put your hand in the soil,
it's actually going to be warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to wait another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically two weeks is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it is going past two weeks,
you probably did mix it a little too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: In which case I would take that one and
mix it with another one, another trash can
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'd already pre-mixed that's a little
less hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got like a diluted version of
that original mix that's still going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: plenty potent enough to do whatever you
want in vegetative or flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're holding off until the
temperature kind of goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what temperature would be too
hot by chance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are people taking like a temperature
gun and like putting in on their pile and
[SPEAKER_01]: then saying, oh, okay, this is low enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that actually,
because during the exothermic reaction,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could get anywhere up to like 130
degrees Fahrenheit, which is very warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's why I like to use heavy duty
trash cans because it can get a little out
[SPEAKER_00]: of control sometimes with the amount of
heat that these things can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also if you have the, if you're doing
this in your area where you have your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, keep that in mind as well,
because it may actually increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which you may or may not want at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would definitely do a temperature or
I don't use temperature guns because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: so much faster for me to reach my hand in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is physically warmer than the
air, that's kind of a good sign that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still working on some stuff and you should
wait a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you start, if you start to see
like white mycelium forming on the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil, things are finishing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's fully cooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel very safe and using that and you
can feel like you did a really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good job because when that's
showing up, you know you've got the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes and the mycorrhizal life that you
wanted to create in the, in your mix in
[SPEAKER_00]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like some good general guidelines
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the two week period, that you're
letting the soil cook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you had a top on the
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going in there and doing like any
type of aeration, like taking the top off
[SPEAKER_01]: once a day, like fanning it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you turning the pile at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any of that or are you just
letting it sit?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a couple holes poked in the lids
of the trash cans so that it can have air
[SPEAKER_00]: gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is, it is kind of, they're not super
airtight so you don't need to poke the
[SPEAKER_00]: hole, but it does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then before we actually started
recording, you brought up a interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is a lot of people what they'll do
is they'll lay a tarp out and they'll put
[SPEAKER_01]: their mixture in together, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll physically use their
hands to mix in things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned some downsides to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you had mentioned something that
you do instead, which is use a mixer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you were saying, I was doing the tarp
method for years and I would get a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of expended pots onto the tarp and
I'd break them all up and I'd put all the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments on there and I'd put more
compost on there and I'd just start
[SPEAKER_00]: folding this tarp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hundreds of pounds at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to add water and then it's
getting heavier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it was just too back breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started looking into alternatives and
we found cement mixers were amazing at
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can handle super heavy loads.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can handle wet, high temperature,
low temperature, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, shoot, we're going to give
that a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grabbed one that's not very big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would maybe recommend getting one just a
little bit bigger than I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fits about seven gallons, but all the
work is taken out of my hands and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a way more thorough mix because
there's just no possible way that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have enough energy and strength
to mix that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as a concrete mixer can in that
amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get to save a whole bunch of time and
a whole bunch of labor, which is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: reason why I got into organic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little lazy and I like to take long
periods where I don't have to do a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of physical labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to take one more thing out of the line
of things, especially moving and mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, shoot, it's worth every dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly suggest if you guys are into
organic growing in any capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, outdoor, you just want to make
your own mix for anything, grab one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll save your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do they cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours I believe was like 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't super outrageous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what also turned us on
to it was, you know, 300 can be a lot at
[SPEAKER_00]: one point in time, but it's going to save
me countless hours of work and maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: a few chiropractor visits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are the dimensions on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you mentioned the actual
dimensions, just so people at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're wondering, you know,
is this something you can keep in your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room or, you know, is it more garage
or backyard type size?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a two point, you can keep it in
your garage or in a basement very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drum fits about seven gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say they called it like a 3.7
liter because they're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got all it has is an on and off
button, one plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: The handle is retracting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just retract the handle out and you
dump it with it on and it pushes all the
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt into your container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super duper simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody could run one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just saves so much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a godsend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'll definitely have to check that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll buy one for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're super portable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come on two wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can roll them around, put them in the
corner, take it out only when you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get your job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's become a must have in the grow room
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have their soil mixed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They ready to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size containers do you generally
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think you mentioned seven gallon
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in larger containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when does that first feeding
actually happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend maybe starting in a
seven and move into a 15 if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want to do like a midway transfer,
a mid transplant or just going straight to
[SPEAKER_00]: the 15 if you don't want to deal with that
and add the extra stressor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crucial to have that surface
area in an organic setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call them batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're soil batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got a 15 gallon soil battery,
it's going to have enough juice to supply
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant for all the way through the
vegetative state and maybe a few weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you're going to want to top
dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want to start using some
compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use them once a week during like
the first three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three to four weeks of flower because
there's a huge uptake in nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're shooting up sometimes double their
size to three times their size in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower room after the flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that takes a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a lot of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's safe to say that a good 60 to 70
percent of the stuff that you thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: there has been eaten up by that point in
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are doing seven gallon pots,
and you just don't have the room to do 15
[SPEAKER_00]: or 10 gallon pots, it just means you got
to do a couple more top dressings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would top dress halfway through
vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your veg period is usually six weeks,
let's say, or four weeks, do a top dress
[SPEAKER_00]: at two weeks in and then top dress right
before it goes in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you should be pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so if you're trying to make it as
easy as possible, 15 gallon containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally plant in there, you don't have
to do your first feeding or top dressing
[SPEAKER_01]: until the flowering stage is what you
mentioned several weeks into the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stage, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been using these seven gallon
containers right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing exactly kind of what
you just mentioned is there are feedings
[SPEAKER_01]: within the vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing a top dressing within the
vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually what I'll do is I'll do about
30 days, then 20 to 30 days, then I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: a top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then shortly after that, I'm usually
flipping to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there I will do another top
dressing roughly 20, 30 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that usually gets me through the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in seven gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you make me want to
actually switch to a larger container
[SPEAKER_01]: because then I have to do less feedings,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it usually ends up equaling out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always worried, you know, maybe if I
do that, I'm not going to be able to run
[SPEAKER_00]: as many plants and my harvest isn't going
to be what it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically when you're running bigger
pots, you're going to get a bigger plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll get that same harvest that you
were thinking of just with less plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's gotten me so convinced that I'm
starting to think maybe I should move up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 30 gallons and do half the amount of
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got a really convinced goblin about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a hard one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're doing the, let's say,
let's say you need to feed in veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you feeding in veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: In veg, I really would just do a light top
dressing of the Kraft blend or the Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth blend that we were talking about
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of let it do its work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water it in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm noticing that that's not enough for
a certain plant, then I'll probably add
[SPEAKER_00]: some worm castings and a little bit of
compost if I've got some extra from mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just kind of, it's like recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reactivates the microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of gives it a kick in the butt
and say, hey, wake up and start delivering
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients to this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get into flowering,
are you doing any different type of
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding or is it the same exact thing that
you just mentioned that you do for veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might add a little bit of, if we're
doing a compost tea, might add a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to go too hard on the sugar
because most everything about the mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing in organic growing,
is to get that microbial life to be alive
[SPEAKER_00]: and to multiply.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get a little too hardcore if you
start going crazy with molasses or sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use that sparingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty much the only other
thing I add.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm doing compost teas, we'll do the
same stuff that's in the soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: The booze compost, the little handful of
Kraft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say handful, I literally mean I'll
grab a handful and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use a 30 gallon, 35 gallon trash
cans for everything I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps all the metrics the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my water reservoirs, 35 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The soil batteries that I just made,
35 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything adds up and I don't have to do
a whole bunch of math and thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I didn't make this here tea strong
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, I don't have, I've been doing
it for so long that I've taken a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the measurements out and just started
using what works for the containers that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nothing, if the container doesn't
change, you know exactly what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentioned worm castings and compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know microbes are going to come along
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many microbial inoculants on
the market today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also mentioned recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use any of the micro products to
inoculate the medium at any point in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, whether it be, you know,
recharge or mammoth pee or any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: micro products out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have some around, I'll do it because
it's a big benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is going to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's no reason not to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it around, if you don't have
it around, I also wouldn't feel too bad
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mitigate that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we were saying with, with your
compost and your, uh, with your manures
[SPEAKER_00]: and with your worm castings and pretty
much any other type of castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I don't worry about it too much,
but if I do have it around, that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: blessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use it and it speeds things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you'll notice I've at least I've
noticed an increase in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the increase in, in the speed of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I use products like that,
I wouldn't rely on them solely because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get away from relying on
products, but also it's great to have
[SPEAKER_00]: something to run to like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, the convenience of it is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also briefly talked about compost
teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do aerated compost teas throughout
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get deeper into that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering when you apply it to your,
apply the compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's going to add in a lot of
beneficial bacteria microbes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to help break down those
amendments, you know, help with nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake, speed up growth, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often are you doing these compost teas
and what's your process for brewing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do compost teas when I'm
noticing that the, uh, plant battery is
[SPEAKER_00]: running out of juice and you'll,
you'll, you'll notice this with the way
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants behaving.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be, uh, praying one day and then
the next day you got a couple of yellow
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves and everything's hanging down and
it just, the plant looks sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look happy anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's a good sign that it's time to
recharge up some of those microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to do that, the easiest way for a lot
of people, including myself, is a compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I like to take a five gallon bucket
with two very large air stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I have a micron filter bag meant
for compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw my ingredients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, typically like a cup of booze blend,
a handful of craft mix, uh, maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of sugar and we'll throw that,
we'll throw one air stone in the bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: one air stone in the bucket with the
mostly full of water, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% full of water and we'll leave that
there for 16 to 20 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find if I go past 24 or into the 48,
it's starting to get a little too
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic in a sense, uh, for lack of a
better word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather use it when it,
when it has all that fresh new life that
[SPEAKER_00]: just came out and it's ready to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I was going to ask you about nutrient
teas as well, but it looks like that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you know, that compost tea that
you mentioned, you're adding in nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you're adding in some craft
blends and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of those, I assume are going to be
water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others aren't going to be water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you take that bag and then put it,
you know, top dress your soil with it or
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I use, yeah, honestly, I'll take
what's left of that bag and I'll put it
[SPEAKER_00]: back into my soil mix, uh, and just kind
of mix it back in and whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever's left is only going to benefit
that soil mix now.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about seed sprouted teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use those, utilize those at all or
no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, me and Gollum have not really used
them that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have tried it out, you know,
just as a, just as a kind of science
[SPEAKER_00]: experiment, but I'm, I'm pretty interested
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of, it's kind of more new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to try it out in a more
controlled setting, maybe pick a tent and
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones are going to get that and
everything else won't kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it was a, it's a, it's a
fascinating idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started looking more into it once,
uh, once you'd brought it up and it's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of, it's kind of fascinating to germinate
a bunch of these seeds and juice them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and then feed them back to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a crazy idea that just might
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely key to use, you know,
especially when you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: organically, you need to make sure that
the, that top layer is moist, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil needs to be moist in order to
have those microbes active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a mulch layer is one of those things
that helps retain the moisture in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you use for mulch layers
typically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I use straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's pretty easy to deal with,
you know, and it does an excellent job of
[SPEAKER_00]: trapping moisture on that top layer so
that things don't dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of a pain in the butt in a
way as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm, I'm exploring different ideas,
maybe, uh, maybe even like a non-organic
[SPEAKER_00]: idea, maybe something like, uh,
that those sheets that they put on gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, something that's just a little
less messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you go back to, I need to take
the, this soil and mix it again,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a whole bunch of straw that
you've got to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it is in big pieces,
which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grab that pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of it is kind of shredded or,
or now decaying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it becomes a problem for me
because I'm super OCD when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only want the things that I've put
in the soil in the soil, but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And besides, you know, getting a little
OCD about cleanliness, it's, it's probably
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the best options for a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, I've been using barley
straw as a mulch layer as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's pretty easy to use for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I am doing that top
dressing, I am lifting it up and putting
[SPEAKER_01]: those amendments underneath the layer and
kind of mixing in the soil underneath that
[SPEAKER_01]: layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'm actually removing entirely
and then putting the amendments up top and
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing them in and then reapplying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people would probably,
probably say I'm disturbing the microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: life a little bit by removing that layer,
then re-adding it, but they might,
[SPEAKER_00]: they might, I mean, it might be,
but I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to lift that up and you got to,
sometimes you got to move some soil around
[SPEAKER_00]: and really mix it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would rather that it got disturbed
and replenished then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happening at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's always a better option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing nothing is never the right idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about cover crops a
little bit and what you do for them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right now we're not using any cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but they can be very beneficial,
especially in determining signs of
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies, uh, before the plant is
actually being harmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, cause those cover crops are going to
be the first ones to see the signs of a,
[SPEAKER_00]: of any type of deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think it's very smart to use a wide
variety of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people picking one and
sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that'll just be the cover crop on
every plant in, in every pot, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you that much, but I think if
you had a mixture, then you could see
[SPEAKER_00]: different traits, uh, of different
deficiencies in different ways on
[SPEAKER_00]: different cover crops, giving you a little
wider spectrum of information,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and more benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause once a lot of these different cover
crops degrade differently when they die
[SPEAKER_00]: off, which giving you different types of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you thought that this cover crop
was going to give you more potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it actually gave you way too much
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got a really, really hot
phosphorus in your, in your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not really sure what to do at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that's the only worry I have with
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is just if you are going to use them,
keep them diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way your soil is eating a whole
diverse palette, like a buffet of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, that's all everybody wants
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some good advice there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've mixed their soil, they've grown
their plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're either using mulch layers and
cover crops or they're not, they're using
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas, top dressing when needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got through, they grow
successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 gallon container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you removing it from that container
and then reamending and then putting it
[SPEAKER_01]: back in your concrete mixer, or are you
keeping that container and just doing kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a no-till style to where you just
replanting directly into that container,
[SPEAKER_01]: reamending and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, good 99% of the time I'm pulling them
and I'm going to mix them with the
[SPEAKER_00]: concrete mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a rare case where I noticed that
the mix was hot all the way through,
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to top dress in the flower
stage and I wasn't doing very many compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas and everything still went fine,
then I'm going to take those specific pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll replant directly in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pull the stalk right out and I'll
replant in them for the veg and then that
[SPEAKER_00]: round you'll have to keep an eye on a
little bit more and you might have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: more top dressings and more feedings on
that specific round, but it'll save you a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of work if you're dealing with large
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's nice to be able to take 10
or 12 that are already hot enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle a veg period and just replant in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious on that one what you
did because I know there's a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways to go about it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go into KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's probably be quite a few
people here that are interested in knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: about KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not something that we've talked
about yet on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't really had any guests that
really talked about KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just get a little bit into it
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in the future I can have somebody on
here to talk a full blown episode of a
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you just do a little bit of KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what is KNF and
then what are some of the KNF methods that
[SPEAKER_01]: you practice?
[SPEAKER_00]: So KNF just stands for Korean Natural
Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way of organically growing and
making your own amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are dependent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are dependent on going to a
store and buying our own amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's a nutrient line or even
organic amendments that are dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get away from that you can start
exploring the land of KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Master Chow is the guy that kind of
invented it or coined it or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shows you a plethora of different ways
to make things like fermented plant juice
[SPEAKER_00]: and labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can essentially replace everything
you're doing with natural products that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can make at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically do for KNF?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only KNF that I've personally messed
with is fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tried to make a few IMO boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still looking for the right area for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO is where you take a sticky form of
rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cook up some rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a sticky rice and you put it in a
box literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cover it up with a paper towel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it out in the forest where you see
there's a high microbial life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hope that that rice gets inoculated by
the naturally occurring funguses that are
[SPEAKER_00]: in that forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you do some more.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like 18 more processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a beginner in KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly what happens after
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the stuff that I've been practicing
so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really fascinating world to dive
into because it starts getting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifics of exactly what's scientifically
happening when you feed your soil and when
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is uptaking nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the things that you've given it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With organics, you take a step back and
you're mixing things together and letting
[SPEAKER_00]: nature take its course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with KNF, in my opinion, it starts
diving back into the territory where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in full control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know exactly what each product is for
and what's happening when you give that
[SPEAKER_00]: product and why.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole different rabbit hole to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned this in far too many of my
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different ways to grow
this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: KNF is another method to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just watching some of Chris Trump's
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are interested in learning
more about KNF, I highly suggest checking
[SPEAKER_00]: out some of those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very informative and they'll kind
of go step by step in explaining what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with KNF and why it's really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard his name quite a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an excellent resource for KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super smart, super smart individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about one more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I feel like we should talk about
this first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pest prevention, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you grow organically, all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your IPM routine?
[SPEAKER_00]: First things first, the best IPM routine
that you can keep in an organic garden is
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure your soil batteries are moist
always.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be your first step.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second step is I love to use jidam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of follows along the same lines as
KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a different category of learning in
practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works so well as a disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a super widespread covering of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super easy to coat both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any downsides that I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural disinfectant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It degrades off the plant naturally within
a few days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it all the way through flower
even and not noticed a difference in my
[SPEAKER_00]: product, the way it tastes, the way it
smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just generally a great idea to have
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's not enough, then I'll start
adding neem leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem seed oil and lavender to the jidam so
that not only is it getting that awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: widespread coverage, but it has more
insect repellent and management
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients in it that are going to be
more effective because of that spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often do you spray and at what point
in the day do you spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm having pest issues, I'll spray
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not having pest issues,
I'll spray twice to three times a week and
[SPEAKER_00]: more often in the veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm not spraying with jidam,
I'll just spray with just plain water in
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the act of getting the leaves moist
and then them drying out is enough to kill
[SPEAKER_00]: certain insects and their eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That practice alone can just save you a
whole bunch of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using it before lights on or
throughout the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, especially in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spray before the lights are on,
probably 20 minutes before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go in there in the dark and just kind
of feel the plant while I'm spraying it,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is another good way to ensure you're
spraying the bottoms of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you grab a stalk and you just kind of
spray in your hand while you're moving up
[SPEAKER_00]: the stalk, you know you're getting every
leaf all the way up that stalk even in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just kind of a trick I picked up
after years of spraying plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's very effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are eggs or actual pests on the
bottoms of those leaves, it will
[SPEAKER_00]: physically disturb them and remove them
essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people will spray during
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said every day you're spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned flowering as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people will stop spraying
and flowering because they don't want any
[SPEAKER_01]: of this on their buds or flowers at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you spray in flower as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will only the jidam, only the jidam.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing I'll spray in flower
and that's only because it naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: degrades within two or three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first I was highly skeptical of doing
that in a flower and I was just like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super worried that it was gonna
affect the product in any way and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not cool with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave it a shot on the last couple and
nothing bad happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a pest issue during
flower, and that's why we really wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a pest issue during flower,
you don't have a lot of options.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some green lacewigs,
you can get some predatory mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only a few things you can do
without severely degrading your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hoping that that could be one more
thing we could add to our list to maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: save some plants in the future that we're
not as lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you only spraying in flower if you see
an issue?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure if you were still doing it
as a preventative, every day spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout flower or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be so much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're having that much of a problem,
it's not a practical solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have dropped the JDOM thing a
while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a good solution and it's super duper
cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a video on Green Goblin
510 showing you how to make it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available on the Green Goblin 510
website as well if you just want to give
[SPEAKER_00]: it a shot to see if it'd be worth it in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help repel or battle off
tons of pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we talking spider mites, aphids,
things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we're talking spider mites,
aphids, thrips, you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a powerful disinfectant and it's a
soap in reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It dries out the exoskeletons of said
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bug doesn't have an outer
exoskeleton, it's going to work even
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really doesn't have a downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use it as intended and you mix it
as intended, you'll dilute it in your IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason not to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's saved me so many headaches in pest
management that I can't speak highly of it
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of good information in this
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about mixing soil, we talked
about feeding, we touched on compost teas,
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch layers, cover crops, KNF,
IPM, a whole bunch of things were packed
[SPEAKER_01]: into this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and then what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to find me,
you can find me on Green Goblin 510,
[SPEAKER_00]: the YouTube channel, as well as Twitch,
Green Goblin 510.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and Goblin are always streaming over
there as much as we can, getting some
[SPEAKER_00]: games in, answering some grow questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as if you're looking to listen to
some music in the garden, I got a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: that on SoundCloud under Lantern Beats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing I got coming up is more
grow videos and more music.
