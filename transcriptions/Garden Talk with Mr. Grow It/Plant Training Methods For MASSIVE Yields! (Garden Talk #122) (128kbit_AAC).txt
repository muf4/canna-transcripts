[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast where
we interview growers from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grellett.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned into the Garden Talk Podcast,
this episode number 122.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an advocate, educator and journalist
and has been gardening for over 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that he's most known for
is his plant training techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle talks all about the various plant
training techniques with a focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing yield.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sim son of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an old Johnny Carson reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know where that came from,
but if you're over 45, you may remember
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have no idea what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny Carson used to do a bit called the
Great Karnak.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might remember this, where he wore a
gold LeMay turban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would give you the answer to the
question before the question was written.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would hold the question up and he
would tell you what the answer was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he would open the envelope and
reverse engineer the jokes that the
[SPEAKER_01]: question came last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's clever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started doing this podcast back in 2021
and I've been meaning to get you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a handful a large handful.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like they come in clusters of
people who are requesting for you to come
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, we need to see a Kyle
Cushman, Mr. Grow a collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did happen on your channel,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: On your podcast a couple months back.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you that didn't catch that
one, I'll definitely link that episode
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the YouTube description section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I finally got you on my podcast and
we're going to talk about, I was trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what we would talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different avenues we can
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go plant training,
but we can also go plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there was so many different avenues we
could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, breeding was one of the ones I
really thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know what, let's keep it
with the training first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a, do a variety of training
techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your own really signature
training technique, which we'll get into,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to keep things very
elementary this time around, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So very beginner focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about plant training
methods and the focus on really much
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know not all plant training methods are
done to increase yield, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly get a, a larger yield from doing
some of these plant training methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into the
episode, can you do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you focused that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were going to ask me about,
tell me about yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, I was born in a
little shack and say, yes, how did I get
[SPEAKER_01]: into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was about 19, 87.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is about three years after I would
have graduated high school.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was a pot dealer and I had a job
and I was a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a pot dealer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, you're a local pot dealer,
you know, that, you know, you went over to
[SPEAKER_01]: his house and you hung out and you started
to join.
[SPEAKER_01]: You picked up a bag and you went away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy who supplied to me,
I had just moved into a new, I got a,
[SPEAKER_01]: a really cool apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a condo with a walk-in
closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he comes over to visit me and I show
him around my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, yo, if you let me grow in
your closet, I'll split it with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally at this point, I had never
even like, I had never even visualized
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't envision every plant you
come across in your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how does sumat grow or how does you
know, like you don't have a visualization
[SPEAKER_01]: for every plant food and fiber plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just didn't at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says, well, yeah, you know,
I have this little Emily's garden thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, I'll give you a couple of
containers of powders and a little pH test
[SPEAKER_01]: kit and a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so now the whole idea was to
produce the product rather than have to
[SPEAKER_01]: like get it from Mexico or Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was how I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into growing because my dealer was
unsuccessful in his attempts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He tried several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got caught by, I believe his mother
growing in his house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he grew at his brother's house
and his wife caught them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he came to me and he was like,
and, and yeah, that's, that's how I was
[SPEAKER_01]: introduced to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come so far since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've been a writer for high
times magazine for over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Oxford university.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a place there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've won several awards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of get into some of those
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was just a, it was just a
journey of really just putting one foot in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of the other, you know, it really
wasn't until I met high times,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was complete accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, it wasn't until I met high
times that I thought that anything was
[SPEAKER_01]: ever going to come of this, except I was
going to end up in jail one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually you're going to get caught
selling or now growing or dealing or
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually you're going to end up in jail
one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what my mom thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was never a happy thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day I walked into a head
shop, a tie dye shop called not fade away
[SPEAKER_01]: tie dye in New Paltz, New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the owner there asked,
he said, I'm going to close up for lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to smoke a joint we made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to reciprocate and I
pulled out my week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed him my week.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, you ever want thought about
wanting to be in high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: My girlfriend knows somebody there and
there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I met high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a long story right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I dropped out of high school
and, um, I got my GED and joined the army.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really literally like loathed
reading and writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't something that I ever did for
pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when somebody offered me a job,
all of a sudden I was like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to kick this in the ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kicked it in the ass in the first 12
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 13 features.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had 13 pieces and 12 issues in the first
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that secured my job there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then I just continued to learn
more, you know, about the whole,
[SPEAKER_01]: the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden I was an advocate,
you know, it was like, I took a job as a
[SPEAKER_01]: journalist, which I was really proud and
honored to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured that I found out that I
could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then along with that, which I'd never
realized came this advocacy, which I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: very intentioned person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very purposeful person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do things incidentally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then I realized that this was
another great intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I took that on wholeheartedly and
then started traveling the country first
[SPEAKER_01]: and the world and meeting all these
amazing illuminaries, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Keith Strout, from the director of
normal and, and the early days of the hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: fast, Vivian McPeak and the peace heathens
and, and all of a sudden I'm in the
[SPEAKER_01]: planning rooms with all of these people,
these amazing events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, I was, I was,
I never felt anything similar to how
[SPEAKER_01]: honored and overwhelmed I was with a
feeling of purpose when all of this just
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, I could write a movie or a book
about that subject, about I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's pretty much the whole ball
of wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, why am I still here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we talking to Kyle Cushman?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's all wrapped up in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just the fact that I, the door opened,
I put my foot in it and, and gave it my
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then that I took on happily the whole
advocacy thing and this, the normalization
[SPEAKER_01]: and the legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it's just a fabulous,
fabulous life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't re-choose it any
other way, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I can speak on behalf of
many of my viewers is that we appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: your contributions over the past 30 plus
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've done so much between high
times and, and breeding and Oak Street
[SPEAKER_00]: University and winning several cups and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a very long history of advocacy
and we appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes me feel really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you continue the tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's more and more people that need
this information every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, home growers, that's,
that's the new advocacy for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've done so many things over
the years, but let's say current state,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoor, outdoor, organic,
synthetic, soil, cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am a home grower, you know,
um, I don't have a commercial company.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a commercial branded line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, of course I represent homegrown very
happily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm just a home grower and I put
my, my home grow online on my Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: and I share it with people and,
um, and, and yeah, that's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've done, I've done and seen it
all pretty much from the containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the 40 foot containers buried in the
ground up in Spyrock and Mendo with the
[SPEAKER_01]: generators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, garages and bedrooms and
warehouses with 250 lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've roomed my home for a 10 by 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a nice 10 by 10 with four LEDs,
all adjustable and all climate controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I try to keep it as non-consuming
as possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like you home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can max out at 12 plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of the states are,
can only max out at six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel fortunate that I, I can do up to
12 and, um, yeah, really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we relate a lot on that or
indoor home grower, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil or cocoa primarily?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I only gave soil a couple of
runs and I just, I, I was, I was never
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to make the transformation,
the whole shift in my head to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, um, the only thing I can say about
cocoa versus, uh, sphagnum cocoa blends,
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, predominantly sphagnum
soilists is I find that, um, they're more
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it doesn't, I find cocoa
changes its properties a little bit at
[SPEAKER_01]: some point when all of a sudden it breaks
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that might've been old cocoa,
like, you know, not your grandpa's cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they're, uh, but I always found
that it was a little, uh, less consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as the uptake and the release of
actual nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've always just stuck with soil
soilists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, um, I like using a higher pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a pH closer to seven than six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's, uh, let's get into the
meat and potatoes of this, what
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's been waiting for training
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned earlier, we're going
to keep it pretty elementary here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to train plants and what
are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, basically, you know, there's very
few, um, agricultural crops, just as a
[SPEAKER_01]: comparison that in the, in, in performing
their duties that they don't train in some
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a good thing to look at is when I
moved to Mendo, I noticed all the grape
[SPEAKER_01]: vines and every year they harvest the
grapes and then they literally cut the
[SPEAKER_01]: vines back to vert to nothing,
to the stump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they regrow all the vines every from
the spring through the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's because they're directing
the energy to the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know how much fruit they want to get
versus, you know, you can control the
[SPEAKER_01]: cluster of the grapes by how much
vegetation ends up at the end of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: when the fruit set happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same kind of thing with,
and so if you just left a plant under its
[SPEAKER_01]: own devices, you would have less nodes and
less flowering sites, and they'd be more
[SPEAKER_01]: spread out over different various heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by training or super cropping,
uh, whether it's, um, low stress training
[SPEAKER_01]: or whether it's high stress training,
you're, you're taking the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate the plant and, uh, decide on
the number of flowering sites you want in
[SPEAKER_01]: relation to the plant size and also,
you know, how long your whole crop cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives you the ultimate control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, um, you know, it's not as
complicated as I just made it sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think another good example is fruit
trees, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like fruit trees, you could let them
grow wild, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people will have that one
main trunk that comes up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the top branches are all fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pruned that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's trained that way in order to try to
get the highest yield possible of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we do the same thing with these
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The orchards you'll see, they harvest them
and then within a month or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: they go back and they trim them all down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they look like they've all got a pretty
little haircut so that they roughly get
[SPEAKER_01]: the same number, same size of fruit,
you know, maybe add for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, it's very important to,
uh, to maximize growth and to minimize
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical height and to maximize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We usually, most people will run out of
horizontal height before vertical height.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, vertical height before they run
out of horizontal height in a homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to these medicinal
plants, talking about yield, how much
[SPEAKER_00]: higher of a yield can you get from a
trained plant versus an untrained plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that just grows naturally?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you have a plant that is
leaning, maybe you look at it and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: tell it needs a cake or something like
that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant that is shaped rather than a plant
that is leaning will always grow faster.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by providing certain, um, support and,
uh, and, uh, limiting the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath, uh, nodes that are never going
to get developed branches that are never
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see the light of day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're increasing your yield right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's far and beyond when you get
into even just, um, the exposure of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes or increasing the capacity for the
plant to uptake nutrients and or water by
[SPEAKER_01]: bending and breaking and things like that,
you know, severe things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's really, um, it's exponential.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do one, um, technique and it's
going to help some.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do two techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do three techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden you're going to see a
substantial increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that also goes down to how
long you're vegging these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big of these plants you actually
growing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're keeping things small,
just doing a 30, 40 day veg, me
[SPEAKER_00]: personally, my experience, I've grown a
untrained plant right next to a plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've trained and I went from five ounces
to eight ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got three ounces more from that
trained plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can certainly, uh, in my
experience, just keeping a small home grow
[SPEAKER_00]: style can certainly have several
additional ounces just from training your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one of the reasons why
people practice it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that I did learn pretty
recently, just in the last few years of,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, touring, uh, large grows, uh,
Santa Barbara and something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed a guy who, of course,
80,000 thousands and thousands of clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to, to, to do these acres of
outdoor greenhouses or even hybrid
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that, you know, um,
you know, when I take clones, I probably
[SPEAKER_01]: take four or five, even six inch clones,
because I have all these, I can bury it a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of inches and I'm going to top and
do all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when you take commercial
agricultural clones, they're usually
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're usually two to three inch clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I was noticing was that basically
as soon as they had grown an inch and
[SPEAKER_01]: rooted, they were topping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked him, I said, do you,
do you do that all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you top your clones so early?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he explained to me how this is a
really important technique because I used
[SPEAKER_01]: to wait until the plant was virtually
developed like fifth node, seventh node,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, multiple sets of full leaves
and branching already coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd use this spiral staircase
technique where I take a leaf from each
[SPEAKER_01]: side to open it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, top your plants as soon as possible,
because what that's going to do is as soon
[SPEAKER_01]: as you top them, it's going to encourage
lateral branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now your lateral branching is going to
be the height of your plant instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: having any apical top whatsoever,
virtually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I did learn early
is top as early as you are comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so topping, for those that don't know,
is really just taking the top of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and either pinching it off or using
trimmers to trim it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a pincher or a cutter?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been a pincher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, you know, I never had any trouble
visualizing where I was supposed to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the top of the plant is just
simply the top of the plant and you should
[SPEAKER_01]: just take off a burgeoning new leaf
opening set of leaves and pinch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, there's that,
that old, um, technique that came about
[SPEAKER_01]: from a tip of the month that I wrote in
High Times Magazine that got, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled thymid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the fact, I love this story
because thymid, everybody would swear it
[SPEAKER_01]: means bleep I missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the theory was that if you cut it
cleanly, like with a scissor, that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just, it's not going to grow back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the two, uh, nodes that would
have popped out on the side of the stem is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going to take over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a nice clean V.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you kind of mess it up and make it
all messy, uh, sometimes very often nodes
[SPEAKER_01]: will shoot out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, sometimes it's three,
four, five crazy numbers of them shoot
[SPEAKER_01]: out, depending on your quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it was never intended to be
thymid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the tip of the month came from a
dude who signed his letter.
Thym.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was from Thym.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't say anything about mist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the culture itself attached that
acronym to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is hilarious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard the F I missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard that one, but I didn't hear about
it actually being somebody's initials or
[SPEAKER_00]: name or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do the topping or the Fimming,
what node are you waiting until the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has grown up to before you do your first
topping or Fim?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I used to wait for five,
maybe even six or seven complete sets,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would mean that you'd already had
one or two sets of branching coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the top of your plant is at least
several inches taller than those side
[SPEAKER_01]: satellite branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and like I said, what I saw in a
commercial setting was, is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, do it as soon as you know
that your plant is flourishing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's going to allow you to,
um, have a wider plant rather than a
[SPEAKER_01]: taller plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because the plant is just programmed
to grow as tall as possible because in the
[SPEAKER_01]: big bad jungle, the actual jungle where
things grow, the one who grows the tallest
[SPEAKER_01]: gets the most sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And very often ones that don't grow tall
enough, don't get any sunlight and
[SPEAKER_01]: literally just croak and die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so yeah, so, I mean, uh,
it's going to depend on where you took
[SPEAKER_01]: your cutting, but so that's why I say it's
not really, it doesn't really matter the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual maturity size of the plant,
how many nodes it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: What matters is, is that you've planted it
and, uh, watered it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the roots that were coming out of your
clone are now coming out of the media in
[SPEAKER_01]: which you planted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you see that it's acceptable to
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, for me, I usually grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am kind of one of the guys who are
counting the nodes and I usually do like
[SPEAKER_00]: the fourth or the fifth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you just do one topping or do you
do, you know, your initial top and then
[SPEAKER_00]: top some of those side branches that kind
of grow up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it kind of depends on whether
you're, um, you know, if you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: for commercial, um, then you really try to
condense practices into the most
[SPEAKER_01]: effective, most efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's probably a
singular top and probably a singular
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant, you know, um, into its final
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have options to, you know,
I see these guys growing on lines where
[SPEAKER_01]: they, they interweave the plants and they
make them look all pretty and they put
[SPEAKER_01]: them through the chicken wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, um, I think one top is,
is most of the time is going to be excess
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's only when you, and I'll say the
reason why I say that is because by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time you get to the thought of topping a
second time on that same plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a better way of
utilizing that vegetation than there is
[SPEAKER_01]: topping it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, of course, the secondary goal of
topping other than yield enhancement is,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, maximizing your, uh, the space that
you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that top that you're thinking about
topping again is because if you bent it
[SPEAKER_01]: over or tucked it under somewhere,
uh, it would just be, uh, growing outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the horizontal space that you want for
that plant, then you should take it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's, you know, that's my
explanation is, is one, one top should be
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you feel like, if there's some
satellites that are growing out of the way
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't think you can weave it
somewhere or put it somewhere efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: then top it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the nodes will just take the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no topping, uh, no topping once you
flip flowering unless you missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have, you should know by then
whether you want to use that piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation to gain mature flowers or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've noticed a piece underneath that
you missed and it's not going to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if something is shooting up and
you don't like it, but the best thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do would be to bend that down and just
secure it with a twist tie or a piece of
[SPEAKER_01]: string or super cropping technique,
and then utilize that vegetation rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than chop it off and throw it in the
garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm with you on the one top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've, you know, I've done it so many ways
over the years, uh, top once and then top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those branches top those branches
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I played around a lot and I find
myself in, you know, the past five plus
[SPEAKER_00]: years really just doing that one top,
letting those side branches come out and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just doing low stress training from
there, which we're going to get into here
[SPEAKER_00]: in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but yeah, the one top,
one of the main reasons why I do is just
[SPEAKER_00]: to get that side branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some females out there that I'll
grow and I don't need to top at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side branches are just natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having that one top in there really
helps with those side branches and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: things out horizontally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, for example, I'm finishing up six foot
tall plants in my tents right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I top those three times so
that I could end up with 22 dozen tops,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's a six foot plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I top them three times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got topping, we got fimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get into one of the things
you're most known for, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: chiropractic training technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe what that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you came up with it and how to do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that name too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody along the way, like 10 years in
started said, Hey, that's like
[SPEAKER_01]: chiropractic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I was, I was calling it super
cropping and basically super cropping to
[SPEAKER_01]: me is is a technique that enhances you,
you know, hence super cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the, the chiro came interestingly
enough, uh, a long, long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like literally one of the first
stories I was ever sent to cover for high
[SPEAKER_01]: times magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I drove there from New York across the
border in, um, Ontario or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it wasn't Ontario.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was long anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I was going to meet, uh,
one of the few legal patients in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: like just like us, there was only a
handful of them back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was a, uh, a young cat.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like 18 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was living with his mother and they
were only allowed to have two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he had two plants, one each under a
thousand watt parabolic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you remember those seven panel 45 inch
parabolic reflectors?
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a dog cone collar around an
exposed bulb turned upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually used those for a good,
the first eight, 10, 10 years of my
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what he did was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he was only allowed to have two
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He basically had the plan right underneath
where the bulb was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had the plan trained like a
candelabra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bucket is in the middle and he's
got a little bit of stock coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as the stock starts,
he's got a branch trained out like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's little nodes sticking up here
and here and here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got a branch coming with this
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's nodes sticking up here
and here and here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could picture underneath this
parabolic light, the light hangs down to
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a plant that is all trained down.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all these branches and all these
nodes standing up so that the ones on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside are the same distance from the
ball, roughly two feet from the ball,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, two and a half feet as the one
underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he created this arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underneath of this plan, and he did it
with a combination of bending and
[SPEAKER_01]: twisting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a floral, the wire they use
for floral arrangements to keep them in
[SPEAKER_01]: place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real stiff wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was the most amazing thing I ever
saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I being more lazy than he,
he had more time on his hands than I did
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that one thing, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a real job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started finding a way to twist and
bend and then kind of like I'd massage the
[SPEAKER_01]: plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I'm doing this, I slowly bend it
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd first break the inner herd and then
slowly bend it over like this until it sat
[SPEAKER_01]: down perpendicular and then take my thumb
underneath and do a little pinch,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little, just a little pinch,
just enough so that it couldn't grow back
[SPEAKER_01]: up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was much more efficient for the plant
for the tip to just grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so without all that wiring and without
all that tiring, I came up with that super
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started doing this candelabra
shaping so that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I could, one, keep my lights lower
to all of the budding sites.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's and so the techniques before me
that was like Scrog, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that I didn't like about
Scrog was it locks your plants into place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being a journalist, I always wanted to
be able to find the best angle for the
[SPEAKER_01]: photograph.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I developed that along with the
teepee technique where you take three
[SPEAKER_01]: stakes and put them in like a tripod in
the bucket and bring them together at the
[SPEAKER_01]: top like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you tie strings from the top of
the teepee down to the branches so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you could support the larger branches in
the edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still had autonomy on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a, it's like me holding my
pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hold it like between this finger instead
of this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always got to be different for some
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were, you were the creator of the
super cropping, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I don't, you know,
I'm sure that it was, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, I didn't create, uh,
veganic farming, you know, when I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: design vegan matrix, but I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't highlight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did kind of bring it to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's maybe what I did is,
you know, I, I brought it to the forefront
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could do these Uber
manipulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to tell this story about somebody
who told me once, literally this old man,
[SPEAKER_01]: he said, yeah, when I grew, we grew in the
woods and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, when I put my seeds in the
ground, I'd come back later in the season
[SPEAKER_01]: and I would just stomp on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stomp on them, crush them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd walk through the garden two or three
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the ones that grew back up were
the strongest ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have to worry about going too
tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people could see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they're weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's, it's, you can,
you can manipulate these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest, I don't have any sites
committed to memory, but if you look
[SPEAKER_01]: around, there's these, uh, plant artists,
um, all over the internet that are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: these bonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, did you know that you can
bonsai any plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a, people think that a bonsai
tree is a bonsai tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally, you can bonsai any plant
and is extremely, extremely conducive to
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of manipulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trick is which ones get you there the
fastest and which ones are just
[SPEAKER_01]: ornamental, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can be very extravagant with
things like you mentioned, or you can keep
[SPEAKER_00]: things simple and just not even doing a
topping or a fimming or really doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: high stress training techniques where
you're damaging the plant at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just do what's called low stress
training, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bending the branches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about low stress
training, what that is and maybe how you
[SPEAKER_00]: go about doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I use low stress training as a,
as like I said, a second or a third
[SPEAKER_01]: technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already done several.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already broken the, the, the,
the main stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start off right at the bottom of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and people wonder when, when you do
this, I don't do it when it's early or
[SPEAKER_01]: young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I usually do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to do it a lot, but I found one
or two really good treatments at the right
[SPEAKER_01]: time is the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, like a week or so before
flowering, um, is really all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start at the bottom and you in
opposite directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you stabilize the plant,
you'll hear a snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's pretty darn loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you let go, the plant's not going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just broken the inner herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you work your way up every inch
or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And break and every branch you do that
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you create these really nice knuckles
that, uh, made the plant stand on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you're increasing, uh,
the cap, the capillary action inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant for its ability to take up water and
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I start with that and then,
um, as the plant progresses and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: these branches that are outgrowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even after I do, you do the topping at
just the right time, you're still going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, two weeks in, three weeks in,
four weeks in, whatever your vegging is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only like to do two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you're going to have a couple of
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second, so as I'm going back for my
weekly super cropping, cushioned chiro
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment, that's when I'll do the,
where I massage it and I bend it over and
[SPEAKER_01]: then crack it right where I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll look at the plant from the above
and I'll find a spot where that branch,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I bend it over, is going to take an
open spot and I bend it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, when the plants are kind
of like, their shape is all good and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: like a week into flowering or maybe two
weeks into flowering and I see what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll use a passive technique to just
finish off where I want everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could be by putting a stake in at
an angle and then pulling this branch over
[SPEAKER_01]: to the stake and just clipping into it so
that now there's room in between the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're opening up the center of the
plant or simply taking a branch that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: already, without a stake, and just finding
a node where you can attach a sling and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just putting a hole in the top of the
bucket and then pulling that out slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: and securing it to the rim of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now that's a good way of opening
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are passive ways where you're not
damaging or wounding the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just moving things to make the
absorption of light more ideal and the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual physical structure of the plant so
that you're filling in spaces and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of opening up the plants so that
your secondary and all the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: internodes get light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even canopy is a grower's best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way you explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You explain it so a beginner can pick it
up and even just bending the branches out
[SPEAKER_00]: to get light in the middle is definitely
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can definitely help increase light down
in to penetrate the canopy and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly help increase yield overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate you explaining that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, so just to say a little bit
is, you know, well, okay, what I was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get into was, you know, the next thing
people want to know is about de-leafing
[SPEAKER_01]: and denoting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to talk to you about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a very important part of
maximizing your plants so that you get the
[SPEAKER_01]: right amount of full mature flowers as
opposed to all kinds of errant little
[SPEAKER_01]: undeveloped, larvae, immature stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I like to do is the first time I
clean up the plant, I clean up the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I initially wanted to say was,
so when you're manipulating the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulating the branches to maximize the
light coming in, you're going to have all
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of leafage everywhere popping up and
big leaves from the interior.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I say is interior leaves,
interior pointing leaves you always
[SPEAKER_01]: remove, okay, because they're going to be
covering something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an easy one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the trick is, is to leave both
nodes and the lower leaves because those
[SPEAKER_01]: are your solar collectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you lollipop, as they like to call
it, the first time you clean up your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, and as you're denoting,
you remove all those lower leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to slow the growth of your
plant down, I'll dare say 10, 15%,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you're growing at a very high
density.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing plants that are allowing
to be receiving each their own full,
[SPEAKER_01]: intense, direct light, meaning they're not
smushed up against each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't remove those lower leaves until
later on when flowers start developing and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're really worrying about airflow and
stuff because what you want to do is you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get down underneath the canopy of
your plant and look up into the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everywhere where you can see from the
ground and you can see the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's photons of light that is getting
wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going from the light and hitting the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have leaves, intermittent
leaves, even though they may be three
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes down from the main leaves,
if you've got a leaf here and a leaf here
[SPEAKER_01]: and a leaf here and a leaf here,
it's collecting secondary light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little secondary times four or five
on each plant adds up to substantial
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that adds up to root growth and taking
up water and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't remove that stuff the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave it through veg and leave it into
early flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you get ready to flower about
a weekend, about two weeks before,
[SPEAKER_01]: like when you do the first chiropractic is
when I'll start denoting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I do the first time is,
it may sound crazy, but I denode either
[SPEAKER_01]: just leaving the tip and like one or two
nodes or virtually all the way to the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will leave no nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may have eight nodes on this branch and
I'm only going to denote all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the tip and I'm going to leave all those
little leaves in between that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be all all the way up to
the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's because I like to grow a lot
of sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm a week before flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means this plant is going to stretch
for another three to four weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: giving me another six, seven, eight nodes
from where I left it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to take away all my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have to go back in and do it
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I'm growing an indica or a hybrid,
I'll leave the top and just two extra
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by the time bud set happens,
you've got your six to eight nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything below that is garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you lollipop and remove all those
leaves the first time you do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to slow the plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard anybody doing it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I probably want to try
out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, I totally get what you mean
by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can certainly slow things down if not
done properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing too is when the plant
wants to grow sets of leaves, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what it's going to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a nice long hardy branch,
you're growing plants that are a foot
[SPEAKER_01]: tall, that are going to flower at two,
two and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's kind of an average size
height of two and a half, three foot tall
[SPEAKER_01]: flowered plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have nice long,
hefty branches that are a foot long,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to have lots of nodes on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be four to five
leaves in between there from the top and
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you leave a branch for a
couple of weeks of vegging where you would
[SPEAKER_01]: have taken off those four or five leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only going to grow slower,
but it's going to stretch more in between
[SPEAKER_01]: the nodes because it needs to throw out
more leaves because it's trying to replace
[SPEAKER_01]: what you took away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what about like defoliation though?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just plucking off leaves or like leaf
tucking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's how I learned that leaving
them was so important because when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: really young and I was 25 years old,
24 years old, I started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any guides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there was actually the Ed's guide
was out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found that tucking was very useful
and I do it several times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go into the garden and I would
tuck them down and they would pop back up
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed that they were blocking,
you know, branches and nodes that I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tuck them down again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I learned that if you leave the
exteriors and wait and develop the
[SPEAKER_01]: interior, let the branches and nodes
develop on the interior, it's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just how much energy that plant can
absorb, how many photons of light as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to the surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use everything's life as math,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just removed, if you denote like
later on where I do, like I'm now I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: week into flowering and I'm going to
remove every leaf that is not 50% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: height of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any leaf that's not 50% in the middle or
above, that's when they go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now I get the nice air flow and I
get more water turnover and all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before that, so that those few buckets
that I'm pulling off and you fill those
[SPEAKER_01]: few buckets, imagine the surface area of
supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, just get underneath and put
your eyes and look up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everywhere you see a crack that you
see the actual light array, that's if you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't remove that leaf, imagine like
pulling it and now you see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I understand and I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to leave all a lot of the outer
leaves for the reason you mentioned and
[SPEAKER_00]: also some of the lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that was in one of
the videos I created, gosh, I had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: been five or six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's on my channel talking about
lollipopping and defoliation is leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the lower set of leaves right
above the lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to lollipop, but typically still do
a quarter to a third of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that first batch of leaves,
leave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people take them off and I usually
leave them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like a skirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I called the skirt technique is leave it
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause another reason why to leave it not
only for light penetration, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned is like you want to capture some
of those photons that are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are solar panels, but this is also
going to help you identify if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem happening, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these problems that happen are
going to be on those lower leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nitrogen talks, a nitrogen
deficiency, for example, starts at the
[SPEAKER_00]: lower leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like you're able to still see that and
then take action right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus if you were to remove them,
well, you might not notice as quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I call those indicator leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was taught to me by an old
outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always want to have some of the
largest oldest leaves because they are the
[SPEAKER_01]: only early indicator of some of those
nutrient deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another reason I like to leave
actually some of the older largest leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: is because again, it goes back to the
photography and the journalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks really amazing when you have
that original seven bladed leaf that ends
[SPEAKER_01]: up turning all fall colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this big, it's as big as a dinner
plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the plant behind it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes for a great photograph.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my fair share of very large
leaves that I've taken pictures of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of all these training methods that we
talked about, you've done quite a bit over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years to many different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the biggest yields that
you've gotten from plants that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: trained?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always shooting for yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I tell everybody I always try to
grow the best, not the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, let's get real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adam, you know, I'm Adam before I was
Kyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, that's why how I overgrow
my garden all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I'm I don't I don't really
intentionally set out to grow the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once I get started, I'm trying to
I'm putting so much energy into maximizing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from from cycling the plants as
much as possible to develop the most
[SPEAKER_01]: prolific roots to literally not overdoing
it, but feeding hard because the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: want food in order to produce a lot of
fruit, you know, and really overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then, of course, I can't get
in there and take pictures of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore because they're so big that they
just it doesn't look like they're supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the question?
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Largest yields, like biggest yields you've
kind of gotten from trained plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest plants I've ever grown indoors
are actually probably might be in my tent
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're equal to the ones that I did
back in Mendo days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a little bit over a pound of plant
and they were Sage, Masta, Adam Duns,
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, and Sage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew was right after I got arrested,
believe it or not, Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trial was pending and everything,
but they didn't take away my rights to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like literally, I got out of jail the
next day and I went and planted six
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so I had medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so that, you know, it's so you're
only allowed to have six.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew them to the ceiling and probably
benched them for, you know, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: three, two or three months, two and a half
months or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a pound, I think it was close to a
pound and a quarter indoors in my
[SPEAKER_01]: basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I've got now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got these 20 gallon, 25 gallon pots,
six foot tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I vegged them for 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just finishing up their eighth
week here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before I get to go to Barcelona,
I'm going to be be harvesting here pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to be 12 to 16 or 18
ounces each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I only got to eat plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it really easy to take care of,
you know, a lot of trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really easy because everything is
just super, super chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's really not much trimming
to do on some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The varietals that I'm playing with,
the grape ape and the cherry Lopez is like
[SPEAKER_01]: little here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just very, very delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes things easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of getting towards the end here,
I want to get some advice from you,
[SPEAKER_00]: really advice for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about back when you first started
growing and you were a beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could tell yourself what you
know now, what advice would you give your
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner self?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, back then my beginner self would
not have told anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my first crop I ever grew would not
have gotten stolen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But besides that, you know, it really is
the plants that are the healthiest are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be the most potent and yield the
most.
[SPEAKER_01]: So focus on growing healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the key to doing that is observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike a lot of other skills, that you
acquire, it takes a lot of doing over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over again, training muscles and
brain and coordination and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening is really more about
observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can, by observing you,
what I call you learn the language of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and the plant will speak to you,
not out loud necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plant will speak to you and you
will learn what the plant, the plant will
[SPEAKER_01]: express itself in different ways,
whether when it's happy versus not,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it needs water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's a living being.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people argue whether it's
sentient or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not here to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a living, it is alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so observation you know, checking on
it now and then every time after you
[SPEAKER_01]: water, and you'll get a sense very quickly
as to whether it liked what you gave it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to assess was it just,
you know, you know, there's other factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just observation and and try to
remember that a plant is not a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a car where you can put
higher octane gas in it and just hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: throttle and make it go faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's there are sometimes when you
have to treat it like an animal where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a living thing where you can hurt it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to observe like if you
were suddenly you're going to get a guinea
[SPEAKER_01]: pig, you never had a guinea pig,
you don't know what to feed it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't know how to take care of it,
you have to observe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So observe and and then there are other
times when you can treat a plant like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a machine, when it's like it doesn't know
you don't you can keep it in vegetation,
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative state for ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to get hurt and wonder why
the sun isn't going down and develop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a combination of of techniques
that you learn through mostly through
[SPEAKER_01]: observation and then of course,
trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we covered a lot of stuff in this
episode in regards to plant training and
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm Kyle Cushman 420 on Instagram,
and that's my main outlet besides YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is sponsored, of course,
by Holyrood County Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how great is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can now have access to all these
just hundreds of varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a lot you can search
either Homegrown or Kyle Cushman on both
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube and on Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's tutorials that we've been
doing now for eight years, plus hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: of hours of cloning and drying and
planting and harvesting and and strain
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluations and what they're good for and
different ailments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a there's a whole lot of
video out there that I've put a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm most proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then, yeah, don't forget,
I didn't even say once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had an awesome episode with Jim
Belushi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we did our Christmas episode
with you, of course, Mr. Growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're now in our second episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're well along our second season,
rather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on all streaming platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really enjoying doing that and
going to bring some really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: guests in the future.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really great podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the audience, I'll definitely have
a link to that episode that I did with him
[SPEAKER_00]: on his podcast down in the YouTube
description section below along with a
[SPEAKER_00]: link to get to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can easily access how to get
to Kyle's social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle, thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You broke down a lot of good information
in regards to plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's really valuable for a lot
of my audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, thank you so much and hope
you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're very welcome and grow your own,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
