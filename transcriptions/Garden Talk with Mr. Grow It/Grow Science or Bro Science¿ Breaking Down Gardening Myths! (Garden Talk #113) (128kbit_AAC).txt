[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast where
we interview growers from all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, both beginners and experts seeking
to learn more about what they know about
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening and how they do things in their
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_02]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 113.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode I interview Nick Nicolai.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been on the podcast once before,
episode number 76, where he talked all
[SPEAKER_02]: about carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nick is the owner of Rooted Leaf Agrotech
and has been gardening for over 25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has advanced knowledge in plant science
and in this episode he breaks down the
[SPEAKER_02]: science in regards to many gardening myths
that you hear or bro science that many
[SPEAKER_02]: gardeners implement in their garden in
order to try to achieve a better result.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the longest episode yet and packed
full of good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your pen and pads ready because you
may want to take notes for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_02]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: That channel is dedicated to short bite
size clips of these podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a gardening channel with over
130 videos showing the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have that channel linked down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_02]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_02]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: They now have humidifiers called the
CloudForge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using the CloudForge T3,
which has a 4.5 liter capacity and can be
[SPEAKER_02]: filled from the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also includes a hose so you can place
the humidifier outside your grow tent and
[SPEAKER_02]: feed the hose into your grow tent,
saving you precious space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also connects to the Controller 69 Pro
so you can control it from your
[SPEAKER_02]: smartphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_02]: their humidifiers and the discount code
MrGrowAt15 works on both Amazon and their
[SPEAKER_02]: website, ACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been using Stash Blend for over a
year now and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that I really like is
that it saves me money.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a whole bunch of different inputs in
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I no longer have to go out there and
buy a silica bottle, then a separate
[SPEAKER_02]: seaweed bottle, beneficial bacteria,
then a separate one for mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of that plus more is in this one
blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to stashblend.com to learn more about
it and I'll also have a link down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I am joined with Nick Nikolayev from
Rooted Leaf Agri-Tech.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I pronounce your name right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nick Nikolayev.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your second time on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one was a fan favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: 261,000 views so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be top five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top five Garden Talk as far as number of
views.
[SPEAKER_02]: You talked all about carbon and just so
much knowledge bombs were dropped in that
[SPEAKER_02]: episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are listening to this episode right
now, haven't tuned into that one,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're definitely going to want to tune
into that one after this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll definitely have a link in the YouTube
description section below so you can
[SPEAKER_02]: easily get to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one, this one's going to be good as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you introduce yourself for the
audience members who don't know you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my name is Nick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice to meet you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who I haven't talked to
and certainly I'm looking forward to
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing from you.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a lot of people that I've already
spoken to, I'm the CEO of Rooted Leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: Agrotech.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a carbon based fertilizer
manufacturer that's based in Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been in business since about 2019
and we've really developed a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique platform for manufacturing
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea with what we're trying to do is
treat carbon like a macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the cultivation of most crops,
food crops and medicinal crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes a lot of sense to keep carbon as
the number one most important thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: you as a grower should be focused on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, in the first episode that we
did, I dive into great detail about that
[SPEAKER_01]: so I would highly encourage and recommend
people go and check that out if you want a
[SPEAKER_01]: deep dive into why carbon is the most
important macronutrient by far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we even did an episode on From the
Stash quite recently and that one blew up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of value being dropped.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll link that one in the description
section as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so much good information coming from
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hook up my viewers with a discount
code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's still active.
[SPEAKER_02]: Discount code MRGROWIT on your website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rootedleaf.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll link that in the description section
below as well.

[SPEAKER_01]: about what we're doing and what goes into
each product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly I'm open to discussion about
how much further the rabbit hole goes or

[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Growit, use the coupon code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's topic, this is going to be a fun
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually done this similar style on a
couple different podcasts in the past and
[SPEAKER_02]: people love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be talking about bro
science, things that people deem as bro
[SPEAKER_02]: science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, there may or may not be science to
back it up, but we're going to go through
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole bunch of things here today and
it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy the rapid fire approach too and
being able to answer a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: seemingly disconnected questions and by
the end of the conversation, we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: actually have a jigsaw puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The individual pieces, once you start to
make sense of it, you see the big picture
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what I want to try to help
people understand in their gardens is how
[SPEAKER_01]: do you get the most out of anything that
you're growing, whether you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: roses for competition or you're just
trying to feed your family and grow some
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and lettuce in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully there's going to be some good
content and some of the myths,
[SPEAKER_01]: misconceptions, truths and half truths
that we'll look at today will help enable
[SPEAKER_01]: people to get better results and achieve a
greater level of success.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a lot of knowledge in
biochemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the chemical processes that happen
in living organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest with you, biochemistry is
one of those things that go over my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it probably goes over a lot of
people heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so, so complex and you do such a
great job of grasping onto it,
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding it, and then relaying it in
layman's terms for the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start going through some of these
questions and I'm sure there's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of things that relate to
biochemistry that you can be bringing up
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first up, grow light, sunrise and
sunset feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's often said that, Hey, replicate
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nature has a sunrise.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a sunset.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a light spectrum in there that's
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: For both of those, that's what's best for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grow lights now have a sunrise and
sunset feature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Dr. Bruce Bugby, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He actually did a study in regards to the
rate of photosynthesis for a sunrise,
[SPEAKER_02]: sunset versus just turning the lights on
full blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he had mentioned the plants were able
to take it full blast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing that he kind of
uncovered there in one study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, studies need to be repeated in
order for it to be true fact, blah,
[SPEAKER_02]: blah, blah, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sunrise, sunset feature, is there any
benefit to this or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when you're trying to get a
holistic expression of the planet makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to consider that some of the light
energy coming in during those early
[SPEAKER_01]: morning hours or even in the late evening,
you know, it's not primarily used for
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are wavelengths of light that come
in and they just kind of help spread a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain kind of message in the plant so it
can kind of start to express different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe do things like close the stomata at
nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, typically when studies are done
on things like this, what they're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at doing is just measuring one variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, it would be let's say
quantum yield or the photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_01]: overall in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take just that narrow slice
out of the rest of the plant and what the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the plant is doing, you know,
it becomes a little bit more clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, I mean, plants will take in
the amount of light energy that you give
[SPEAKER_01]: to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just full blast, turn on the lights
right away and then just turn them off at
[SPEAKER_01]: nighttime, you're only measuring
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'll see the results skewed
from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're looking at things like gene
expression or even the migration of the
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochromes from the outermost layer of
the leaf where they are during the daytime
[SPEAKER_01]: to a little bit closer in the nucleus of
the cells at nighttime, there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: physical migration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you took a cross section of a leaf
and looked at it from the side,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a profile shot, you'd find that the
leaf is very dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chlorophyll and most of the pigments
that absorb light energy, those are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be close to the outer layers of the
leaf, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you get into the deeper layers of
the leaf, more of that light has been
[SPEAKER_01]: filtered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, on the underside of the
leaf, almost all of the light has been
[SPEAKER_01]: filtered out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that's really coming
through is a little bit of green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why, you know, plants look green
effectively from the underside.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also reflect a little bit of that
wavelength of light, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the point I'm trying to
make here is that there are physiological
[SPEAKER_01]: processes that happen that have been fine
tuned over the course of millions,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not tens or even hundreds of millions
of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are very used to the rising and the
setting of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's nuanced things that happen
that have to do more with gene expression
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of like the big picture of what a
plant is, as opposed to just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, photosynthesis, you know,
quantum yield and carbohydrate production
[SPEAKER_01]: and Calvin cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are just like tiny
components, very important components.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of like the primary engines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have all these accessory things
that get tagged along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think that, you know, natural
sunrise and sunset really are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: just help create a better expression in
the plant overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what if this grow light just simply
tunes up the amount of light and doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: change that spectrum to truly simulate
sunrise and sunset?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you say that's kind of a wasted
feature or would you still see that as
[SPEAKER_02]: being valuable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think there could be value to it
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think to replicate perfectly
what the sun does kind of depends on where
[SPEAKER_01]: you are, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're, you know, in the southern
hemisphere, northern, if you're high
[SPEAKER_01]: altitude, for example, you might get more
UV light exposure on those plants versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower altitude, you might get less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are differences for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no such thing as a light that
can truly replicate the full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sun is just, you know,
it operates on a fundamentally different
[SPEAKER_01]: principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one really has like a nuclear reactor
that's powering their grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They oftentimes have LEDs, which are
totally different in terms of the mode of
[SPEAKER_01]: operation, you know, or they have high
intensity discharge like metal highlight
[SPEAKER_01]: and high pressure sodium lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are fundamentally different
than what the sun is and how the sun puts
[SPEAKER_01]: out, you know, different wavelengths of
energy and really that full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not just the visible light
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, infrared, for example,
the planet is heated by the sun as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are things to consider outside
the context of just what the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of absorbing for the purpose of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really good points there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the 24 hour light cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's lots of folks who say that the
plants don't need a resting period at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can just blast it with 24 hours of
light and the plant will grow better than
[SPEAKER_02]: if they were on an 18-6 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, people on the opposing side
say, no, plants do need a resting period
[SPEAKER_02]: with the lights off.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also talks about the, you know,
not just the plants having a benefit from
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights off, but the microbes in the
medium as well need that resting period.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it kind of stems from the same
issue overall is when we're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: things from just that scientific
perspective, it tends to, we get this very
[SPEAKER_01]: narrow slice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so photosynthesis is like a car
engine, for example, and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: byproducts, all the things that you want
your plants to produce, all the wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: aromas and fragrances and flavorful
compounds and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are driven by light, but it's much
like a car engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you get more horsepower if you leave
your car running for 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, sometimes you have to let
that, you've got to turn the engine off so
[SPEAKER_01]: that the accessory belts and everything
else doesn't like get burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burn down and get worn down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing is true for plants as well,
because they've evolved to capture energy
[SPEAKER_01]: from the sun during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then during the night, they're not
necessarily inactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like the plants go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually still very metabolically
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the activity associated with
plants at nighttime revolves around taking
[SPEAKER_01]: the sugars that they've produced
throughout the day and doing things like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe maintaining their own internal
temperatures, maybe feeding some
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbes and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also something to be said about
the stomata and the way that the water
[SPEAKER_01]: flows in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is maybe a little bit more minor of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when the lights are on or when the sun
is out, plants are taking up water from
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots and transpiring it through the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lights turn off and the sun sets,
the stomata on the leaves close.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have this reversal of a
pressure gradient, meaning that the water
[SPEAKER_01]: from the roots is no longer flowing up
like it is when the stomata are open.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they close, actually what ends up
happening is the roots can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: secrete organic acids and all the
byproducts of photosynthesis during the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots will actually push that stuff
back out into the surrounding medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the rhizosphere that narrow like
one to two millimeters just outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: root hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this secretion of the root
exudates that attract the microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: attract the fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where the plant can kind
of modulate its relationship with those
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms to help optimize the
chemistry of whatever is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is important in my perspective to
maintain that synergy with what plants
[SPEAKER_01]: have been doing for so long anyways,
because a lot of times when you start
[SPEAKER_01]: hybridizing plants, particularly those
that are grown in indoor controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment kind of scenarios,
they get really sensitive to certain types
[SPEAKER_01]: of environmental stressors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yes, you can run your engine 24
hours a day, but the moment you flick the
[SPEAKER_01]: timing belt, the whole thing just snaps
and breaks apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is similar to how certain crops
when they're grown indoors in controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, the stability of them tends
to go down over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have like a dehumidifier in the
room, for example, and it puts off a blue
[SPEAKER_01]: light, just a tiny, tiny little amount of
light, that can be enough to trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the plant that makes it
become stressed out and give you different
[SPEAKER_01]: results than what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the plant starts to go kind of down
this path as opposed to the other path
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wanted to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things typically don't happen in
nature because there is a moon out there
[SPEAKER_01]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even during a full moon, a lot of the
genetics that are just like wild growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't respond negatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have these stress responses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have their photo periods
disrupted by the tiny, tiny little amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of light that the moon reflects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like a lot of the sensitivities
and a lot of the instabilities that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been created over time have been
artificially selected for, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: because a lot of people don't understand
what they're doing when they run their car
[SPEAKER_01]: engine for 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they wonder why the belts are
starting to get worn down and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: is starting to break and it's just wear
and tear, that type of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's your personal recommendation for
light cycle for the vegetation stage and
[SPEAKER_02]: then recommendation for light cycle for
the flower stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends on where the gene pool
comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're growing something closer
to the equator, they can handle longer
[SPEAKER_01]: periods of daylight, shorter periods of
the dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing something that's
maybe a little bit more northern or a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more southern, probably
something closer to 18.6 would be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 hours on, six hours off.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, 20 hours on, four hours
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there's a real benefit
associated with having that dark period
[SPEAKER_01]: for, regardless of what you're growing or
how you're growing it, I do think that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a benefit and a value associated
with that dark period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a little bit, there's some
plasticity because it also depends on how
[SPEAKER_01]: much your plants are capable of handling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give them really, really good
airflow and the VPD is always in that
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect spot and the soil chemistry is
just right and the light intensity is
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect but not too much, plants can
cruise along at the optimal spot for a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: longer versus if you have the lights just
a little bit too intense, they quickly
[SPEAKER_01]: become saturated and maybe if you have
your lights on for 18 hours, you might
[SPEAKER_01]: start to notice right around 12 to 14
hours your plants almost look like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not sad but they start to get a little
droopy or like they're getting ready to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to sleep because they're reaching that
point where the equilibrium is being
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown off and they're kind of trying to
catch up to the stress rather than staying
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead of it and being able to deal with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the leaves droop towards the end
of the light cycle, are you saying that
[SPEAKER_02]: there is an indication that something is
wrong or is that a natural thing that
[SPEAKER_02]: happens with all of these medicinal plants
as they all droop down before the light
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle naturally?
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, it could mean that it's too
much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you'd want to take a look at the
visual morphology of the plants to see if
[SPEAKER_01]: you have any burned leaf tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one in particular with plants
if the transpiration is a little bit off
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are a little bit too dry,
for example, they'll tend to have those
[SPEAKER_01]: burned leaf tips and it could be a sign of
too much light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say to some extent it is natural
for the plants to want to go through those
[SPEAKER_01]: day and night cycles just like plants want
to go through wet dry cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like being really saturated,
lots of water available, but only for a
[SPEAKER_01]: very short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants you can't grow fully,
so the roots cannot be fully submerged.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be exposed to a large amount of
water, but for a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the pendulum swings the other way and
the soil becomes much drier, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the roots start to dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: These wet dry cycles are very advantageous
to plants because it allows them to
[SPEAKER_01]: balance their chemistry and their
metabolism out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the same thing is true of day and
night cycles for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants do have this tendency to go
back through and create a balance in that
[SPEAKER_01]: swing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you optimize the grow environment and
you optimize the chemistry of the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaves will typically not droop like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll stay nice and perky and active.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those situations, you can push the
plants a little bit harder, maybe a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: light intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also true that plants have circadian
rhythms.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these plants are really looking
towards not only the exposure to the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: itself, but also the duration of the day
versus the night as a mechanism or a
[SPEAKER_01]: trigger for that flowering process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can also factor in temperature as well
for certain plants like hops, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to hit particular temperatures in
order to actually initiate flowering in
[SPEAKER_01]: hop species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about darkness before harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that a lot of folks have
done over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard benefits everything from more
trichomes are produced, secondary
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolites, ripening.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different things that are
said in regards to giving your plant a
[SPEAKER_02]: period of darkness before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is giving your plants a period of darkness
before harvest beneficial at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say largely probably not when you
look at the underlying mechanics of how
[SPEAKER_01]: certain compounds can be produced,
like the monoterpenes and sespiterpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, CBD, all of these compounds,
they're very energy intensive compounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why they require exposure to
direct light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing some of these plants far
away from the light under low light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity with low pressure and low stress
overall, you're probably not going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the best results.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a high intensity grow
environment with high intensity lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: that light energy is directly what feeds
those biosynthetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: By cutting out that light energy entirely,
you're actually directly bottlenecking the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of creating a greater throughput
in that particular pathway, you might
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulate the plant to respond in a
particular way, but it's not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the type of response that's fundamentally
hardwired and linked to the light energy
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in and then being utilized through
a very complex process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously photosynthesis first and then
the sugars being transported broken down
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the terpene synthase enzymes
acting on them and polyketide synthase
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes acting on them too to create all
of tolic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things are fundamentally driven by
exposure to light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that it's a little bit of a
misconception or a myth.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are examples of some
compounds that might be produced by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, which create a little bit more of
a rounder or nuanced experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is more for people who are
connoisseurs and aren't necessarily just
[SPEAKER_01]: seeking a high concentration of active
metabolites, but they want that broad
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum of metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be something there,
but it would be largely a personal bias
[SPEAKER_01]: more than like an objectively true thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's objectively true to say that
you would probably see a decrease in the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall concentration of some of these
metabolites, particularly because,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, their biosynthesis and accumulation
is tied directly to the light energy
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you break that, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just a quick note, a lot of these
questions actually came from the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So shout out to those folks that have
followed me on Instagram at MrDocGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only account I have on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just FYI, there are a lot of impersonator
accounts on that platform, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I asked this question about what
garden myths they've heard or pro science
[SPEAKER_02]: things and tons of people had submitted
things in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is kind of like a consolidated
list of not only things that people have
[SPEAKER_02]: submitted in, a couple of them I have
thought up, a couple of them you had
[SPEAKER_02]: actually mentioned that you wanted to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just wanted to mention that there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the questions have been asked
to other guests in other episodes in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past, but definitely want to get Nick's
insight on these as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another thing that people do before
harvesting is they flush their plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: run water through the medium, or they will
simply cut off nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will feed nutrients for the final one
to two weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people go even longer than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there have been a couple studies on
flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: ArcScreen technology study comes to mind
for me where they really found no
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between flushed and unflushed
buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me some insight on your end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does flushing your plants before harvest
provide any benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a myth and a
misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you think about how things
work out in nature, plants don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily have a choice to stop taking
things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about how they metabolize the
various elements and how those relate to
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the first episode that we did,
we had kind of tied all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrients like the NPKs and the
calcins and magnesium, so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: to what plants are trying to achieve
because all of it just ultimately comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really feel like a lot of growers
are leaving yield and quality on the table
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're cutting nutrients out too soon,
because this whole flushing process is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of a misconception from that
perspective of you're going to get an
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in potency or you're going to get
an increase in quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's generally speaking, not the way it
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then even furthermore, if the goal is
to flush some kind of residual salts away
[SPEAKER_01]: from the roots to prevent them from being
taken up or whatever, it would actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: a beneficial practice to incorporate a
small amount of some potassium that has
[SPEAKER_01]: organic acids associated with it,
because those organic acids can directly
[SPEAKER_01]: participate in these types of salt binding
and detoxifying processes that I think a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of growers seek when they add just
plain water into the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to consider too is that
the constant flow of some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals working their way into the plant
is very, very important for that long term
[SPEAKER_01]: stability of the flower or whatever plant
it is that you're trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a little bit of calcium,
getting a little bit of potassium in with
[SPEAKER_01]: every single watering is going to help
with certain things like gene expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: charge conductance, and if the plants are
doing photosynthesis during the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days or even the last couple of
weeks of their life, a lot of the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: that flows through the plant from
photosynthesis, plants are looking towards
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these minerals to help create a
little bit of a charge balance between
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potassium is actually a really good one
to talk about from that perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you feed potassium to your
plants during the mid to late stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, you're actually increasing the
overall appetite that the plant has for
[SPEAKER_01]: taking CO2 out of their hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in conjunction with light,
obviously, this directly impacts the
[SPEAKER_02]: overall production of terpenes and other
compounds that people use to bring out
[SPEAKER_02]: purple color.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any truth to any of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say that the anthocyanin,
which is the purple pigments, the
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesis of them can be tied to
exposure to cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of what it has to do is
plants have membranes that are like
[SPEAKER_01]: phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've ever taken a glass of cold
water and added a drop of oil into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature of the water forces the
coalescence of the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this distinct blob or drop of
oil that floats on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you have a glass of warm water
and you drop oil inside of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that oil could disperse a little bit more
evenly across the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to stretch out and it tends to
not just clump up together like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you put ice on the soil and ice flush
your plants, really what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_01]: exposing them to cold temperatures that
create a sort of brittleness, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, these are phospholipids,
they're oils, they're fats, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant's defensive mechanism is it
doesn't want that fat to kind of coalesce
[SPEAKER_01]: like that because for their cell wall
membranes, for example, or for the
[SPEAKER_01]: integrity of these membranes, it's really
important for them to be able to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch out and maintain that adequate
reach that they have across the full
[SPEAKER_01]: volume or surface area of wherever they're
located.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anthocyanins, which are those
purple pigments, can be produced by plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because they'll kind of modify the
properties of those phospholipids a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll allow them to be exposed to colder
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: without necessarily becoming so brittle
and cracking, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, I think putting the ice
water flush thing, I think it can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: do more harm than good for a couple of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that any time that we're talking
about that purple pigment being
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesized, those anthocyanins directly
compete for substrates with CBD and THC
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of these other molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a competition between the two of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a building block that either
gets diverted to make a purple pigment or
[SPEAKER_01]: it gets diverted to make something called
all of tolic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a little bit of crosstalk
between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of get balanced out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is that plants are taking in
CO2 from the environment around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the real question is, where does that
carbon go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the carbon goes towards making
a purple pigment, it could have instead
[SPEAKER_01]: gone towards making a monoterpene or a
sesquiterpene or maybe some CBD or other
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it becomes a little bit of a
problem in that context.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason that it could be an issue
is because when you have really cold
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures in the feed water,
if you're exposing your plants to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the flow of energy coming in through
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, that energy comes in and you
want to get your plants to express all of
[SPEAKER_01]: those wonderful colors and flavors and
aromas that you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you expose your plants to low
temperatures, what ends up happening is
[SPEAKER_01]: that energy actually gets diverted away
from the production of secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolites and it instead becomes
uncoupled from ATP generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's something called
thermogenesis, which is just generation of
[SPEAKER_01]: heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The practical sort of application here
might be like every time that you eat a
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, you might notice your body
temperature actually goes up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is possible to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's been done a number of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you eat food, your body is
breaking that food down and is releasing
[SPEAKER_01]: that energy just as heat because your body
needs to maintain a particular temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to operate efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homeostasis is what this is called.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maintaining the optimum temperature to
allow all the enzymes in your body to
[SPEAKER_01]: function, all the proteins to work
properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, you don't want cold and
brittle joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might notice this if they have
really sensitive joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the temperatures go down,
the joints become really stiff and the
[SPEAKER_01]: joints become really sensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of the same phenomena in
plants, meaning that if they're exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: cold temperatures that are below their
threshold, instead of taking that energy
[SPEAKER_01]: from the sun and producing compounds with
it, they'll take the energy from the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: and produce heat with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal of producing heat is to raise
the temperature of the water that they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been exposed to so that it becomes
sufficient for their basic operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always just an energy tax
placed on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say ice flushing is probably
not very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does slow down total transpiration in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does decrease the availability of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a cold glass of water versus
a hot glass of water, you can fit a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more sugar inside of that hot glass of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add teaspoon after teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep stirring, and that hot water will
dissolve all of that sugar way more
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively than a glass of cold water is
going to dissolve that same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants are faced with the same
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take CO2 out of the air, and they're
trying to create sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in order for those sugars to be
properly dissolved inside of their own
[SPEAKER_01]: tissues, it requires the water to be at a
particular temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants are very heavily invested in
maintaining that temperature mark because
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't have the ability to just put on
another layer or a jacket if they get too
[SPEAKER_01]: cold or they can't stand up and walk
somewhere else where it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to deal with the environment
that they're exposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that environment is cold,
their primary focus becomes let's generate
[SPEAKER_01]: heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondary metabolites are useless without
a functional cell to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary purpose at that moment in time
is going to be for the plant to take the
[SPEAKER_01]: energy from the sun and create heat,
which is a problem when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create colors and flavors and aromas and
all these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that it's doing is it's
really slowing down your microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lower the temp, the slower the
microbes function.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're relying on the microbes in
order to break down organic matter and
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle nutrients so the plant can uptake
it, well, you're kind of slowing down that
[SPEAKER_02]: process by adding ice water into your
medium there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, what I usually do to bring
out the colors towards the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering is I'll just lower the ambient
temp, you know, the room temp into the low
[SPEAKER_02]: 60s, high 50s, degree Fahrenheit,
and that usually does help bring out some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that might be a better
approach to bring out the colors if that's
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of your goal is to kind of get some
colors out of it, doing that route instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of doing the ice flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the antifreeze sort of
mechanism that we talked about too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just dropping the temperatures a
little bit will create a little shock in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and they have a vested interest
in not only offsetting the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: changes, but also producing compounds that
can help them deal with or mitigate that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where the purple pigments start
to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can modify the way that some of these
compounds behave at really low
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures, like those fatty acids and
those oils, which tend to just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: clump up and come all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not an ideal state for all of your
cells to be in because you want your cells
[SPEAKER_01]: to take up a large surface area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that plasticity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that cell to be able to kind of
move around and expand because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: always water coming in during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vacuoles fill up as the roots take
that water up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want the cell to be able to expand
and then also to contract once the water
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves the vacuole and then gets destined
for photosynthesis or for transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this constant water pump phenomena
where the plants are swelling up as they
[SPEAKER_01]: fill up with water and then they're kind
of shrinking back down as that water
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves the vacuole.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to maintain this dynamic with
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at really cold temperatures,
the outer layers become very brittle and
[SPEAKER_01]: it becomes difficult for the plants to
effectively expand without cracking the
[SPEAKER_01]: outer layers of the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't like that because it starts
to create oxidative damages, starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy the cells and the organelles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they produce these purple pigments that
modify those phospholipids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even at low temperatures, now the
plant can properly go through this
[SPEAKER_01]: expansion and contraction process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good info.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move right along here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up we have stem splitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some people actually split the stem or
the stalk during the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically it's a little bit before harvest
in order to stress the plant into
[SPEAKER_02]: producing more trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that actually work?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on what flavor of
trichome we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the ones that have heads on them
with the stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ones that have just the stalks
with no heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ones that are just the heads
sitting on the surface of the leaf with no
[SPEAKER_01]: stalks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some that are
non-glandular trichomes that are either
[SPEAKER_01]: phytolith deposits like if you grow
cucumbers or if you grow tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: those pokey little spines that go all up
along the stalk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And particularly for some varieties of
cucumber, they can actually form on the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruit itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are systoliths if they're calcium
carbonate deposits and they're phytoliths
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're some kind of silica deposit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for plants that take up a large
concentration of silicon, zucchini and
[SPEAKER_01]: squash are good examples of plants that
can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll actually secrete those and make
non-glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those serve defensive purposes as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say if you're talking about in
the context of glandular trichomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that have the stalks,
the stalks and the heads, it's probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to increase the biosynthesis of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of studies that are
coming out that are particularly done on
[SPEAKER_01]: hops for lupulin glands, then also on
lavender buds, which produce a large
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of linalool and myrcine,
awesomine, camphine.
[SPEAKER_01]: These terpenes might be quite familiar to
your audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lavender buds, it's been shown that
there's a phenomena that happens in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early stages of flowering where,
and this may not be true for all plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but effectively the idea is that the plant
is in the first two to three weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, the plant's trying to figure
out which of its trichomes are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones with the heads and with the
stalks coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts to dedicate resources really
early on because plants are master
[SPEAKER_01]: mathematicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really, really good at doing math
and they're really good for planning
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always trying to build an
understanding of what's right around the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to build up stockpiles of
energy so they can deal with changes in
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all this ultimately to say that the
present presence of these bulbous,
[SPEAKER_01]: the capitate stalked trichomes is what
they're called, but the ones that have
[SPEAKER_01]: heads on them, the decision to make those
is made several weeks in advance before it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually extends off the leaf surface and
becomes an actual stalked trichome with a
[SPEAKER_01]: head on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant's trying to plan and try to
figure these things out pretty early on in
[SPEAKER_01]: the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to do it just before harvest doesn't
really give the plants enough time to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust properly because as far as the
expression goes of the plant, they make
[SPEAKER_01]: these decisions several weeks in advance
before it actually happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think focusing on what
happens in the first two to three weeks of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering can actually set the plants up
for success for the second half of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering so you can get the best possible
results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to answer the question more directly
or more specifically, I don't think that
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be directly connected to an
increase in yield or quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may see some trichomes come up,
but those may not be the ones that become
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated in oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those may be more defensive compounds like
the non-glandular trichomes or even the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that don't have heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just the stalks that come out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because a trichome can form,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But in order for it to get that potency
takes a little while, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the timeline on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when a trichome was formed,
typically you're about going from clear to
[SPEAKER_02]: cloudy to amber.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the general timeline for that
transition?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it kind of depends on I mean,
it could take several weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the transition between
particularly when you're going from like
[SPEAKER_01]: cloudy to amber, it's really when the
color starts to form inside of those
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome heads, there's an indication of
some change in the chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes what could be happening is
the compounds that are inside of that
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome head could be starting to
oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they oxidize, the color will change
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of growers will look at this as
a sign of maturity, like the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to be harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are certainly cases where like if
you feed the correct things to your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, if you have a dialed in fertilizer
program, your plants will inherently be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to resist that oxidative stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they may develop those trichome heads
more rapidly in the first, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: half of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to like develop them a lot
faster and the flowers will grow out a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when the trichome heads
themselves are starting to become a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more cloudy and milky, they'll hang
out in that transitionary space between
[SPEAKER_01]: being clear and being amber for a lot
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll resist the degradation
associated with that, that amber effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll go through the first
half really rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then for the second half, it takes
them forever, seemingly forever to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: up and to properly oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see that color change happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what happens inside of the
trichome heads, as far as like the change
[SPEAKER_01]: of the constituents and what those
molecules are inside of there,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are driven by non enzymatic
processes, meaning it's not something
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of the plant that's actually
causing this discoloration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually an environmental stressor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it makes sense to pay
attention to certain plants like hops,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good example of a plant
with, it has bracts on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cone and then the lupulin glands
actually face inward.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other plants, tomatoes may be a
good one as well, where the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pointed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you look at the stalks and
leaf surfaces of tomatoes, you'll see that
[SPEAKER_01]: those trichomes are actually exposed to
the surrounding environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important consideration too,
because when you're just exposed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors with no protective sheath,
like popcorns have, the bract itself is an
[SPEAKER_01]: actual physical sheath that protects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're more likely to get oxidative
decomposition just because it's exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: the air, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, moving right along.
[SPEAKER_02]: This next one is actually from a viewer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a little scenario here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Cannabas420.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is on my forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: He posted this, mrgroot.com slash forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Head on over there if you want to connect
with some people, like-minded people who
[SPEAKER_02]: grow, get a lot of home growers,
indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some commercial growers pop on there,
but feel free to stop by mrgroot.com slash
[SPEAKER_02]: forum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign up to that and feel free to share
your grow, or you can ask questions in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Cannabas420 posted about carbonated
water and whether or not it's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to read off his scenario
here, and then you can give me some
[SPEAKER_02]: insight on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he had mentioned that he uses
carbonated water to water his plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that carbonated water lowers the pH
drastically to four to six pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: He had to up the pH to over 10 pH to get
close to his liking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he dumped a bunch of pH up in there and
was wondering if that's safe to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also wondering when the carbonation wears
off, will the water's pH shoot back up to
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 pH?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might have read that a little bit
wrong, but basically you've seen these pH
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustments with adding carbonated water
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you give us some insight on
carbonated water, whether or not it's
[SPEAKER_02]: beneficial to use within the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, carbonated water is not beneficial
to use in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary reason is that carbonated
water contains CO2, and CO2 inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: water likes to not stay in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes up and out of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these swings in pH actually follow this
equilibrium between carbonic acid that's
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved inside of the solution or the
liquid phase, and then the CO2 that's
[SPEAKER_01]: being spontaneously off gassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually why this is the same
exact phenomena why if you open up a can
[SPEAKER_01]: of soda on a hot summer day, well,
first off, all carbonated beverages are
[SPEAKER_01]: pressurized.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that they're pressurized is
because if they're not pressurized,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CO2 wants to leave in a normal
atmospheric setting, just like outdoors or
[SPEAKER_01]: even just sitting inside of living room
because we're not in a pressurized
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime that we have CO2 present inside of
a liquid solution, the natural default
[SPEAKER_01]: tendency is or the default state is for
that CO2 to escape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back out into the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why the pH swings because
initially you have a high concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonic acid that's present, which lowers
the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you just let that,
you know, can of soda or carbonated water
[SPEAKER_01]: sit out for long enough, it will
eventually go completely flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still have, you know, it'll be
mildly acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is that the CO2 doesn't want
to stay in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really serve a benefit to
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, it's worth mentioning that the the
oxygen that's present that's attached to
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon is what creates an energy draw
on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have to use the power of
the sun to break that oxygen off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like you're doing the plants
any favors by watering in CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be better to have instead of the
oxidized carbon or the one that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen, it'd be better to have reduced
carbon, meaning no oxygen inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like organic acids are a really
good example of this because they already
[SPEAKER_01]: have that power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That energy is already kind of built into
the bond that the molecule has with,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the carbon based molecule has a
particular amount of power that's stored
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of it or energy that's stored
inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to consider, too,
is that oftentimes carbonated water can
[SPEAKER_01]: interact adversely with minerals like
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you can start to form
bicarbonates, bicarbonate residues in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and the buildup of bicarbonate can
actually be quite harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why when you look at applying
things like oyster shell meal or crab
[SPEAKER_01]: shell meal or any kind of shell meal
that's a calcium rich, even even egg
[SPEAKER_01]: shells from chickens, they have the same
problem of the carbonate there is not very
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive to plant biochemistry,
nor is it conducive towards soil
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times it's just kind of like
it binds up and ties minerals in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes them less available for plants
to take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bicarbonate residues can also drive the pH
up as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why oftentimes I see well water
that has a high pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well water can be alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH sometimes can be eight or nine
because there's calcium in the present,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, calcium is present inside of
that well water, but it's specifically in
[SPEAKER_01]: the form of calcium carbonate or calcium
bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are these various
carbonate, you know, molecules attached to
[SPEAKER_01]: the calcium or the magnesium or the
potassium that make it a little bit less
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be a little bit of a problem
more than it is a good way to deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I actually have a lot of
bicarbonates and actually a lot of sodium
[SPEAKER_02]: in my tap water and that increases my pH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't really know the impact of it
at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I tried to use my tap water before
you know, I wanted to be more eco-friendly
[SPEAKER_02]: here using the tap water instead of having
to use Auro, which does produce some
[SPEAKER_02]: wastewater, which I actually use that in
my outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not truly, truly wasting it,
but having the sodium and bicarbonates in
[SPEAKER_02]: it screwed up my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm never using those ever again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm forced to kind of filter it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like bicarbonates kind of sneak
in people's regimen in a sense in their
[SPEAKER_02]: source of water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that and
called that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of that dovetails perfectly
into a question about, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like adjusting the pH, I guess you could
say, you know, is that what would you use
[SPEAKER_01]: to adjust the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you know, it's an important
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that in some cases,
like for your water in particular,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a lot of calcium carbonate or
even sodium carbonate, particularly if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's high in calcium, you know,
the least effective way to adjust the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be by using a phosphoric acid
based or sulfuric acid based pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is because if you
have high calcium dissolved in the tap
[SPEAKER_01]: water or in the well water and you're
putting a large amount of phosphorus or
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur in with that, you're going to
create calcium sulfate, which is gypsum or
[SPEAKER_01]: drywall, or you're going to create calcium
phosphate, which is what your bones are
[SPEAKER_01]: made out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And either one of those two forms of
calcium is very soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're doing is taking the calcium
that's naturally present in the water and
[SPEAKER_01]: exposing it to a compound that decreases
the availability of that calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's a much better idea to use
something like vinegar to adjust the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: because that particular form of calcium,
calcium acetate is significantly more
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like thousands of times more soluble
than the calcium phosphate and the calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for every drop of vinegar that you put
in, you could be increasing the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of calcium significantly for
the plants rather than decreasing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to consider, too,
is that a lot of the interactions that are
[SPEAKER_01]: organic acids have with carbonates is one
that they'll attack chemically the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate bond itself that, you know,
the carbonate is bonded to a cation and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll attack that bond, free up that
mineral and effectively chelate it or
[SPEAKER_01]: complex it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bicarbonate gets off gas to
CO2 because of that chemical attack,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will, that proper pH down like a
vinegar based pH down would be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the vinegar out there that you buy
at the store is going to be around three
[SPEAKER_01]: to five percent acidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're dealing with a really,
really hard well water, it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial to find something stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do make like an 80 percent acetic
acid solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it'll be called glacial acetic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff is very, very concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, phosphoric acid is interesting
because you can open up a bottle of 75
[SPEAKER_01]: percent phosphoric acid and smell it and
it smells actually kind of sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not unpalatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you try to do the same thing with
80 percent vinegar, you're going to burn
[SPEAKER_01]: your nose, your eyes are going to burn,
you're going to cough and it's just not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be a good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend people to use vinegar
if they're dealing with water that's high
[SPEAKER_01]: in calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But find the appropriate strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's three to five percent,
that's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to work great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice little benefit there, too,
is that any kind of excess organic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: excess vinegar is going to get rapidly
metabolized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really, really good food source for
beneficial microbes and fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, acetic acid residues or acetates
are the most common metabolites in all of
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything has an acetate associated with
it at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that microbes do dovetails
perfectly into acetate based chemistry and
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing with fungi and plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all utilize very, very high
concentrations of acetate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes very difficult to throw the
equilibrium in the soil off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes very difficult to burn the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could easily overdo it with something
like a sulfuric acid or nitric acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can really damage if taken
too far, you can really damage the
[SPEAKER_01]: physical and chemical properties of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus the biological qualities of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the same thing is much harder to
achieve when you're using organic acids
[SPEAKER_01]: like vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so difficult to put too much in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you'd have to like really go
overboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, point being ultimately that
there's a huge buffer range as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: what's safe and what's acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to switch to vinegar
after hearing this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that was one of the
questions is a lot of growers swear that
[SPEAKER_02]: using some sort of organic or all natural
pH adjuster is better than using like
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, lemon juice was named.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to talk about vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Baking soda was also named.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would generally recommend for that
for folks to go after those sources versus
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say in most in almost all cases,
yeah, it makes a lot of sense to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind, too, that, you know,
the organic acids like the if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon juice, for example, or if you're
using vinegar, those types of acids are
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly metabolized by almost all
organisms on this planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really important consideration
because when plants are exposed to high
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations of these acids,
they can take them up and they'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: burn them as extra fuel sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a problem for them to intake,
you know, pretty much everything that you
[SPEAKER_01]: throw at them and to be able to actually
properly metabolize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants have not evolved similar mechanisms
to deal with high concentrations of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid because it just doesn't
exist out of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no such thing as phosphoric
acid out of nature anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there is such a thing as vinegar and
acetic acid and citric acid and ascorbic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, which is what you're going to find
inside of lemon juice, which is vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, citric acid is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people associate citrus
fruits with citric acid and certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus fruits produce some citric acid,
but they primarily produce a different
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of acid called ascorbic acid,
which is vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the chief organic acid that
they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ascorbic acid is useful in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a fundamental in all plants
that are grown anywhere on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ascorbic acid is one of the fundamental
non-enzymatic antioxidants inside of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, meaning if you knock out ascorbic
acid and you just prevent the plant from
[SPEAKER_01]: having it, there is no such thing as a
plant cell anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't function without ascorbic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fundamental to the existence of a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course it makes sense if you
supplement organic acids like vitamin C to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants that they naturally have a very
sophisticated way of dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take it in and break it down and
then funnel that energy towards any number
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not true with sulfuric acid or
nitric acid or phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll find that the tolerance that
your plants and your soil and your
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes have for vinegar are
significantly greater than for phosphoric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid and some of the synthetic pH downs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would avoid using baking soda if
possible because baking soda is typically,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a carbonate or bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that could kind of create some issues
overall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, can some of these pH up, pH down
sources kill off microbes?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a common thing that people had
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, hey, if you're using these things,
they're killing off microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, obviously in their raw form,
right, isn't Vinica used as like a
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning method.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's supposed to kill off
microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like in its raw form, it'll do harm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people are worried that when you're
using pH up and pH down just in water,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still harming microbial life once
you're actually pouring that into the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any truth to that or is that just
bro science?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the purpose of the dilute feed water
that you're applying to the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not really going to harm the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, like nitrates, for example,
which I think a lot of people associate
[SPEAKER_01]: with detrimental effects on soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrates are very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a natural source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get produced by microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get produced by, you know,
thunderstorms when there's lightning that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes through the sky, that intense heat,
that plasma that's generated breaks,
[SPEAKER_01]: dinitrogen gas bonds apart in the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's rain, it'll take that,
you know, nitrogen that's been broken
[SPEAKER_01]: apart and solubilize it and rain down some
nitrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why plants actually look,
you know, after a thunderstorm,
[SPEAKER_01]: the air has a particular smell and plants
may look a little bit more perky and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has partially to do with the fact
that there's soluble nitrogen fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: being created as a part of this natural
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrates are very, very natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: When used excessively, I think they can
throw equilibriums off in soils and it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes a long time to actually,
you know, destroy the soil biology because
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil biology will do everything that
it can to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're talking about like the specific
mechanism of action for oxidizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are like, you know, potassium
hydroxide based pH up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, they'll break down cell
walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will completely denature DNA and
they'll cause irreversible damage to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that it touches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants, fungi, microorganisms,
even humans shouldn't be exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium hydroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, for the purpose of creating
dilute feed water, usually it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: measured in that kind of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, potassium hydroxide is used to
make soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last time you wash your hands with
soap, it didn't cause a chemical burn,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that something is ultimately
processed informs how it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolized or how it's going to be
accepted into a system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say if you're just dosing your
plants with just straight pH up or pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down, that's going to cause some serious
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, when you're talking about the
tank of feed water that's made that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to apply to your plants,
usually that tends to hang out in a pH
[SPEAKER_01]: range that's mostly acceptable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the concentration of nutrients is also
pretty universally accepted for all plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and all microbes and all fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may notice a decrease in the overall
activity of certain like fungi,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, that are known to help plants
access phosphorus in phosphorus limited
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the benefits that
beneficial fungi can bring into the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not deficient in phosphorus,
that one little pathway could get turned
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's other benefits associated with
having that fungi there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be some stress response or
stress related benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be some disease suppression
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungi produce all kinds of wonderful
antimicrobial compounds, antiviral
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: These can be useful for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of just their ability to help fix
and make a little bit of phosphorus more
[SPEAKER_01]: available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of touched upon the next
question here a little bit, but I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to ask it again in case there's anything
else that you can add to it, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: synthetic nutrients killing off microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, it's often said that mineral based or
synthetic nutrients, salt based is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to cause a high salinity environment
that's going to kill off the microbial
[SPEAKER_02]: life in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some people say that that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of organic gardeners, they avoid
bottled nutrients because of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And other folks say that that's false.
[SPEAKER_02]: That these microbes are able to withstand
the high salinity environment down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think soil microorganisms are
capable of living in environments that are
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some evidence to suggest
they can even survive on comets that have
[SPEAKER_01]: been, you know, maybe not comets,
but like some spacecraft that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: launched out of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember there was a study that was done
on water bears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tardigrata was the genus and they had
launched them into outer space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I noticed that, you know,
the intense radiation outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere of the earth, these water bears
were capable of surviving and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: reproducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in some cases, I think the same thing
is true of fungi and microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's even a theory out there
that suggests that either beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes or fungi, you know, once came
from a different planet and they somehow
[SPEAKER_01]: survived on a comet that smashed into the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how life started or spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just look at the ability of
these microorganisms to survive in
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely harsh environments, it becomes
clear that, you know, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: ionized fertilizer isn't really going to
damage them sufficiently enough to kill
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say in most cases, the microbes
themselves have the ability to resist
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of stressors, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also keep in mind that anything
that really directly benefits the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes will find a way to dovetail
into that operation because their primary
[SPEAKER_01]: interest is in getting sugars from the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they form these beneficial
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will photosynthesize and produce
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if you're using a synthetic
fertilizer, as long as the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and it's growing, it's very likely
that the plant is capable of also
[SPEAKER_01]: supporting beneficial relationships in the
soil, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a major consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that there are physical and
chemical changes that can happen to the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, depending on how much organic matter
is going to be present inside of a feed
[SPEAKER_01]: program, I guess you could say,
if you're just feeding pure salt based
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer with no organic matter
whatsoever, no humic acid, no seed plant
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts, no terrestrial plant extracts,
just salt based fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, the introduction of high
concentrations of these elements can start
[SPEAKER_01]: to strip away at the organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really the loss of the organic
matter in soils that's tied to a decline
[SPEAKER_01]: in the populations of beneficial microbes
and beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can focus on building up that
healthy soil chemistry, effectively what
[SPEAKER_01]: that means is that you're building up the
supply of carbon available for those
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms to thrive on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anything attacks that directly,
like nitrates and other salt based
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that come in through salt based
fertilizer programs, those can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: start to directly impact the concentration
of organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that decreases, so too does the
populations of beneficial microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the direct link between the
salt based fertilizers and the viability
[SPEAKER_01]: of beneficial microbes and fungi,
I think it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: disconnected.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other layers of stuff that you
have to work through in order to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: that downstream effect of, yeah,
this damaged the soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how did it damage the soil biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: It stripped all the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It removed everything that the microbes
depend on for life basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's ultimately what ends up
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you expending on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still, I mean, I've been working in the
industry here since 2015 and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that has been brought up since
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still to this day, people still bring
it up and still want to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So appreciate getting your insight on
there and giving us some additional
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these next couple ones on the list were
actually submitted by you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something you want to talk about.
[SPEAKER_02]: First up, let's talk PK boosters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us your insight on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there is a little bit of a myth
associated with PK boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people overutilize phosphorus
without understanding exactly how it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get metabolized in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the important thing to remember is
that most phosphorus in the bone,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not most, but let's say half of the
phosphorus roughly that you apply to your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants is going to get recycled in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to just get sunk into some
like calcium, for example, get sunk into a
[SPEAKER_01]: cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of hangs out there and it doesn't
really interact with the rest of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: once it's been deposited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants naturally have a very high
appetite for calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take up monster quantities of it
because they know there is a terminal
[SPEAKER_01]: sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can just shove it in a cell wall and
they don't have to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they get a little bit more than what
they actually need, it's perfectly fine
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can always find a place to
put it into and make a new cell wall out
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for phosphorus, because it's primarily
recycled in plants, where it becomes a
[SPEAKER_01]: constituent of membranes, which are also
more or less like fixed, they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerate or they don't require as much
replenishment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like calcium in cell walls does.
[SPEAKER_01]: This being the case means that the optimum
concentration of phosphorus to expose your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to is actually a lot lower than a
lot of growers think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think according to the research
articles that have been put out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: most plants will do well with about 30 to
50 PPMs of elemental phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see on the labels is actually not
elemental phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's phosphorus expressed as P2O5.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little bit of a conversion
factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go from P to P2O5?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number you multiply by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like 0.4364 or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, a quick Google search for
those of you who are interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just type in conversion factor P to P2O5.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do that and then you'll find a
calculator online that will allow you to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, 30 to 50 PPMs is kind of
the sweet spot for most plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to give you guys some context in the
vegetative stage of growth, where your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are taking in a large concentration
of nitrogen, you can feed upwards of 150,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe closer to 200 parts per million of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare that with 30 to 50 of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium you can feed in some cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen in excess of 400 parts per
million, probably closer to 500 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compare that with 30 to 50 of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then same thing with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium can be fed in massive
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 plus PPM is no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, phosphorus clocks in 30 to 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a lot of cases, I think when adding
too much of a PK booster into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: really what you're doing is encouraging
the tie up between the phosphorus that's
[SPEAKER_01]: needed in low concentrations and the
calcium that's needed in high
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why during the mid to late
stages of bloom, plants tend to slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The disease pressures start to creep in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like molds and mildews,
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things start to become disease
pressures for plants, not because of
[SPEAKER_01]: anything to do with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But rather a lack of calcium that's caused
by excess of phosphorus fertilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also worth mentioning that because
phosphorus doesn't have an actual sink for
[SPEAKER_01]: most plants, I mean, it does if you're
growing for seed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you grow some flowers out and you want
those flowers to actually be pollinated
[SPEAKER_01]: and to develop a seed, the actual seed
itself is a good sink for phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing for seed and you want
good viability from those seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes sense in that context to do a
little bit of a PK boost, particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: during the seed formation stage,
because then the plants will take up the
[SPEAKER_01]: extra phosphorus and they'll actually sink
it into the seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing just the flower and
you don't want any seeds, the overall
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum for phosphorus is going to be much
lower because again, there's no seed and
[SPEAKER_01]: so there's no sink for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an important consideration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's move down the line here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to take up too much of your
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We definitely passed the hour mark by now,
but a lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit you with a few more here
and then I'll let you go foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or foiler spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some people pronounce it foiler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people pronounce it foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way, tomatoes, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spraying with the lights on versus lights
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now some people say there's harm in
spraying the lights on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people say it's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what it is you're applying
to the plants and it depends on the nature
[SPEAKER_01]: of the chelate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say it's worth paying attention to
what happens in a tropical rainforest
[SPEAKER_01]: where the sun is always out and it tends
to rain quite a bit and it seems like
[SPEAKER_01]: tropical rainforests are pretty diverse in
terms of the total number of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are very, very biodiverse
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge number of plants that are
growing and they've kind of evolved these
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanisms to deal with the sun and rain
being present at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real magnifying effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard people say something like that
where water droplets can kind of magnify
[SPEAKER_01]: the energy of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really think that's the case to be
perfectly honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there's some cause for
concern if you're dealing with compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are insoluble that are present inside
of the water that you're applying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like carbonates, for example, if you've
got well water that's very high TDS and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not treated and it's not filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing foliar sprays of that could result
in some kind of damage because what ends
[SPEAKER_01]: up happening is as the outer layer of the
leaf dries, the minerals that are present
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of that water end up not being
absorbed properly by the plant and they
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to hang out on the outer layers of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the water evaporates and the leaf
surface dries off, there progressively
[SPEAKER_01]: begins to be a little bit of salt
formation that happens and it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: that salt formation that can create some
problems for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have organic acids, if you've got
amino acids or if you've got some chelated
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of nutrients, those typically get
absorbed pretty rapidly through the leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces and doing foliar sprays with the
lights on is generally speaking not an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it makes sense to test on a
small number of plants first and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: turn the lights down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe at 50% if you've got the ability to
adjust the light intensity but if you've
[SPEAKER_01]: never done something like that before or
if you're curious to see if the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have are available through the
leaf surfaces, that's a good practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pick a small number of plants,
turn the lights down a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: spray the plants during the middle of the
day and see what happens and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: there work your way up to gradually
becoming more and more comfortable feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants with the lights on doing
foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in a lot of ways it can actually
be highly beneficial because water itself
[SPEAKER_01]: has a very high heat capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can absorb a lot of heat and this is
important on days where it's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I remember a couple of years ago
here in Washington, it was very hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe two or three years ago in August,
it was something like 110 degrees and we
[SPEAKER_01]: typically don't get that hot here in the
Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, a really hot day is like 85 to 90
degrees so for us to be sitting at 110 was
[SPEAKER_01]: freakishly hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember going outside, I was growing
some zucchini and cucumbers at the time
[SPEAKER_01]: and I remember going outside and I foliar
sprayed my plants with a calcium chelate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 110 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 1 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smack dab in the middle of the day,
in the middle of August and the sun was
[SPEAKER_01]: directly overhead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could not have gotten any more
intense but because the chelate that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying was 100% available for the plants
to take up, it didn't burn them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a pretty hefty dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used a dose that was somewhere between
80 to 100 milliliters per gallon which is
[SPEAKER_01]: astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would typically, for this calcium
chelate, I would recommend people use it
[SPEAKER_01]: at the rate of maybe 10 to 20 milliliters
per gallon and I ended up using it at 80
[SPEAKER_01]: to 100 milliliters per gallon which is
crazy high concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there was any kind of phytotoxicity
associated with that compound itself,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would have manifested itself within a
matter of minutes because the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_01]: dried out within 10 minutes but the plants
actually looked a little bit more perky.
[SPEAKER_01]: They looked a little bit more uppity and I
attribute part of that effect that I saw
[SPEAKER_01]: to the fact that I sprayed water on the
leaf surface so all of that heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf surface temperature, it was just
baking in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was getting scorched and it wasn't
doing too well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I come and give it a cool spray
of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That water soaks up that heat just like a
sponge and the leaf surface cooled down
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now instead of the engine overheating
within plants, now we've brought that
[SPEAKER_01]: engine back to its operational temperature
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just kind of cruising along
through the rest of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say there's some real benefits
associated with the timing of application
[SPEAKER_01]: being the middle of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have those types of stressors where
it's very hot and the light intensity is
[SPEAKER_01]: very high and you know you have a good
fully chelated product that's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cause phytotoxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: This reminds me of conversation we had
with Jorge Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually didn't get a chance to talk to
him about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had him on the From the Stash podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: That episode is being released in a couple
weeks here but one of the things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: wanted to talk to him about, couldn't talk
to him about was reverse foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually have a little excerpt from
his Grower Bible book and I'd like to get
[SPEAKER_02]: your thoughts on it because it relates to
foliar feeding and it's talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: It says the clones from the lower branches
root are easiest because they contain more
[SPEAKER_02]: of the proper hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Clones quickly develop a dense system of
roots when stems of a high carbohydrate
[SPEAKER_02]: and low nitrogen concentration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's recommended to reverse foliar feed
which will leach nutrients from leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially nitrogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: To reverse foliar feed, fill a spray with
clean water and mist mother heavenly every
[SPEAKER_02]: morning for three to four days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Older leaves may turn like green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growth slows as nitrogen is used in
carbohydrates build.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my interpretation of this is if you're
just spraying water on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually impacting it in a way where
nitrogen is being used up a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any truth to that or is this kind
of outdated information?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little bit outdated
information, particularly the idea that
[SPEAKER_01]: the lower branches tend to root out
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very well established and known now
that it's actually the meristematic
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue, the apical meristem that contains
the highest concentration of oxens which
[SPEAKER_01]: are the primary rooting hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers are familiar with these
little gels that they get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root gels, they dip a cut inside of it and
it kind of coats the actual stem and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a synthetic rooting hormone
called Indol-3-butyric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The natural analog, what that synthetic
version is trying to replicate is a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural rooting hormone called
Indol-3-acetic acid which is the primary
[SPEAKER_01]: oxen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I mentioned just a few minutes ago,
acetates are the most abundant metabolite
[SPEAKER_01]: in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example of what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The primary growth hormone in plants is
called Indol-3-acetic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an acetic acid residue basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that is going to be most
concentrated at the apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those tend to have the most vigorous
growth associated with them anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower branches tend to not grow as
fast as the top portion of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The top portion of the canopy is the one
that gets the majority of the
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that good nutrition that's being
lifted up from the roots, it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being preferentially transported to that
apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: The newest, smallest site of growth so
that it can constantly provide a stable
[SPEAKER_01]: supply of building blocks of nutrients and
elements to feed the growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can capture a snapshot of
that, you get a snapshot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by snapshot, I actually mean you take
a cut off a plant that's very healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: growing very vigorously, very rapidly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the types of characteristics
that you're likely to see come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that, the cutting itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are strategies that I've seen
work out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you take care of your mom plants
with a particular combination of foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: sprays, you can actually load those
rooting hormones up inside of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that when you take the cut, it actually
has precursors for indole 3 acetic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need that gel anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to dip your cuts or your
clones and wait seven to 10 days for them
[SPEAKER_01]: to root out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually put that natural compound
inside of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets absorbed through the foliar spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: In about 15 to 20 minutes later,
you take a cut and then everything inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of that cut is going to be exactly what
the plant needs, then propagate new roots
[SPEAKER_01]: and to grow out successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually growers will save a couple of
days instead of seven to 10 days on
[SPEAKER_01]: rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might see about five to seven days
instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm going to have to try that little
shortcut there, a little grow hack there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of stuff that we have learned
over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that quote that I mentioned was
from a book that was written in 2006 and
[SPEAKER_02]: we have learned so much since 2006.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of information that we've
uncovered through science and just regular
[SPEAKER_02]: experiments has been exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really exciting and I'm excited to
see what happens here in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hit you with two more and I
saved the two funnest ones for last.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some, they might seem completely
outrageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others, they say that it's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear your take on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Music for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does playing music for your plants help
with plant growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also heard that playing bird chirping
noises helps with plant growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it be a, I don't know if it's the
stomata opening or what, but those are a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of things I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really interesting topic and I'll
say that the underlying logic was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: developed in the late 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a researcher, Don Carlson,
I think was his name at University of
[SPEAKER_01]: Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say if my memory serves
correctly, but anyways, a researcher in
[SPEAKER_01]: 1986 had put forward this idea that the
stomata themselves could be the
[SPEAKER_01]: conductance of the stomata, meaning the
opening and the closing of the stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: could be influenced by sound frequencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he did was he exposed those plants to
3,000 hertz to 5,000 hertz, which
[SPEAKER_01]: basically mimics a bird chirp in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: What he found was over 15 years of
research, I believe it was, that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: in fact a correlation between playing
noises, bird chirps, maybe music even to
[SPEAKER_01]: some extent, and the overall impact that
it has on the growth of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll kind of back up one step and say that
plants are remarkably sensitive to their
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exceptionally capable of taking in
a variety of different inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to measure and sense every
possible nook and cranny of reality that's
[SPEAKER_01]: external to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, they don't have a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't like get up and move around if
the environment's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're always trying to figure out
what's going on in the environment around
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking in as many data points that
they possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that being said, they are
sensitive to sound waves that come through
[SPEAKER_01]: them, specifically in reference to the way
that the stomata open and close.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's less to do with the physical opening
and physical closing of the stomata and
[SPEAKER_01]: more to do with the maximum size of the
stomata being opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maximum conductance.
[SPEAKER_01]: How open does it actually get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about that like a fuel injector for
a race car.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to create more horsepower
inside the car, inside of the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need those fuel injectors to squirt
more fuel for every second that the engine
[SPEAKER_01]: is operational.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this effectively translates to a
way that the stomata open and close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have stomata open a little
bit further, even if it's a 10 to 15
[SPEAKER_01]: percent increase in the conductance of the
stomata, then you could theoretically
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve a 10 to 15 percent increase in
productivity in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that this has been studied
extensively and it's not just like this
[SPEAKER_01]: one factor that determines it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because ultimately photosynthesis and even
stomata conductance is driven by a very
[SPEAKER_01]: fine-tuned balancing act.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants will open and close selectively
based on a number of different things that
[SPEAKER_01]: occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the wintertime, the sun's still
out, but maybe certain pieces of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't growing because to them it's less
about the exposure to the sun and more
[SPEAKER_01]: about what temperature it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in some other cases, plants are
very sensitive to photoperiod triggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how they initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all of these different
influencing variables that ultimately kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of converge together and that's the final
response that the plant has.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have everything kind of dialed
in, if you have good temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: good humidity, it's very true that
exposing your plants to the right
[SPEAKER_01]: frequencies can actually make a difference
in their growth overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's possible to measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people maybe have taken it a
little bit outside the context of how that
[SPEAKER_01]: theory was initially developed and how
it's been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's certainly true to say that plants
will respond to frequencies just like they
[SPEAKER_01]: respond to frequencies of light,
they'll respond to frequencies of sound.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a couple things that relate to
this singing to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of along the lines of playing
music for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've heard about this old wives tale
or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was this lady who sung to her plants
and then the other plants she didn't sing
[SPEAKER_02]: to and she saw better growth in the plants
that she sung to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll come to find out it was just the
carbon dioxide that she was emitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from her exhale that was
contributing to the growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't actually the singing that did
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I thought that was kind of funny to
bring up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if you've heard of that one
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to bring up in regards to
playing music for your plants that the DB
[SPEAKER_02]: would have to be crazy loud in order for
it to be any impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: The equivalent of a jet engine going off.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when it has to be that loud in
order for it to actually make an impact to
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's true or not,
but I've heard that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so there's a branch of science
called cymatics, and it's basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: effect that sound frequencies have on the
formation of, you know, like on geometric
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns that can be formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea basically is like you've got a
subwoofer and you put a little bit of salt
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of the subwoofer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on what frequency is being
played, it will generate a different kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, geometry, I guess you could
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting to see what exactly
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's certainly true that water will
respond to certain types of sound
[SPEAKER_01]: frequencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of change the geometry of
water, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I imagine there's a similar
mechanism that could actually be at play
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of this stuff is very,
very subtle and very nuanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of it is just like maybe
considered a little bit taboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just don't have the instrumentation
that's sensitive enough for us to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to accurately measure some of this type of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the general consensus right now in the
scientific community is probably that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit esoteric and more than it is
practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there have been a lot of really good
research articles that have been coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out, especially recently that kind of
bridge the gaps in our understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have more sensitive machinery
now that it's possible for us to make
[SPEAKER_01]: these measurements and kind of,
you know, separate the signal from the
[SPEAKER_01]: noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some other cases, like what you just
mentioned, you know, the singing of this
[SPEAKER_01]: lady, she sang to her plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually the CO2 that she released,
which caused the increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that there's some signal there and
then there's some noise there,
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think being able to peel it apart is
what we're kind of getting to a spot of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly there's good reason to think
that plants are going to respond to this
[SPEAKER_01]: type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they kind of evolved, they
co-evolved, they attract pollinators like
[SPEAKER_01]: birds and like other bees, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it stands to reason that they could
also maybe there's some electromagnetic
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction there, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this was actually something that
was determined to be true with the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that lavender interacts with bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess lavender, if I recall correctly,
the study was demonstrating that lavender
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, lavender plants emit a
particular frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that you can hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not audible frequency, but it's still
a frequency that gets emitted and it
[SPEAKER_01]: allows the bees to navigate towards the
flower that's ready to be, the nectar is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to be harvested out of that
particular flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the bee harvests nectar out of
that bud and it flies away, the
[SPEAKER_01]: electromagnetic frequency is no longer
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe turned off for about one minute
to two minutes while that bud sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the nectar kind of fills that
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I may be butchering the
explanation overall of what this study
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstrated, but the idea was basically
that, yeah, plants are emitting,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not noises that are audible to the
human ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still frequencies that they're
putting out there in the surrounding space
[SPEAKER_01]: around them to try to attract these
pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those frequencies are not
compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we often associate attracting
pollinators with the production of
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile compounds, things that we can
actually smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does work like that, but there's also
something to be said about maybe other
[SPEAKER_01]: ways of attracting beneficial pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this opens up a discussion
around these electromagnetic things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're starting to be able to measure and
quantify and better understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, there's something there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's super, super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It reminds me of electroculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the last one we're going to
talk about today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't have a lot of knowledge
about electroculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just see these TikTok videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Instagram reels, where these guys are
like sticking things into the ground and
[SPEAKER_02]: attached into the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you explain to us what
electroculture is?
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there any value to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it actually work?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is this like not something that works
whatsoever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electroculture is interesting because,
you know, like we just talked about with
[SPEAKER_01]: bird chirps and with noises, you know,
that came out of a university in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1980s.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was someone that actually did a
lot of work, 15 years worth of research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was able to demonstrate and,
you know, prove pretty much that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: something at play here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not he was 100 percent right is
less relevant than the fact that he
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered something worth exploration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's definitely something
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to characterize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to figure out what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electroculture is a little bit older.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably goes back to like the mid 1800s,
maybe the late 1800s.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were trying to figure out if
electrical fields had any kind of impact
[SPEAKER_01]: on plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, keep in mind, this is
before we even knew or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: had a very good understanding of NPK
fertilizer, we had no idea what the
[SPEAKER_01]: essential elements were for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know calcium from phosphorus
back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this stuff was characterized
much later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea basically is that with
electroculture, you are creating an
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical field for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, it's a piece of copper wire or
copper tubing that's used in this
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical field will impact plant growth
or benefit plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I misunderstand what is actually going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so many different like,
you know, variables that could happen like
[SPEAKER_01]: if this than that, if that than this,
there's all these like dependencies that
[SPEAKER_01]: get formed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when we're talking about strictly,
you know, electroculture is intended to
[SPEAKER_01]: create an electrical field.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so let's look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when you subject soil
particles to an electrical field?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you have ionized compounds,
ionized elements like ionized calcium or
[SPEAKER_01]: ionized magnesium or whatever,
those ions actually get affected by the
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical field and they can actually
move a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea basically is that,
yeah, electrical fields can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: dovetail into nutrient metabolism and
plants at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the modifier for that is like,
yeah, but what if you don't have ionized
[SPEAKER_01]: particles in your you don't have ionized
atoms inside of your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because mostly the soil is not full of,
you know, ionized particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with like mineralized forms
of nitrogen, for example, not ionized
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dealing with complex complexes that
are more or less stabilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this sort of like thing,
charge balance thing figured out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you amend your soil with calcium
sulfate, you're not dealing with ionized
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the electrical field is maybe a
little bit less relevant overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people also misunderstand the
electrical field by thinking that it
[SPEAKER_01]: directly feeds photosynthetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is actually not how it works at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants use the power of the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, you know, convert light energy into
chemical energy through the electron
[SPEAKER_01]: transport chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the electron transport chain and how
it's evolved to work in plants is much
[SPEAKER_01]: different than a piece of copper wire and
electricity that flows in that copper
[SPEAKER_01]: wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two like very little connective tissue
between the two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's also worth pointing out
that copper itself is considered a
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient inside of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's used for its electrochemical
properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe this is something we had talked
about on your show last episode,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's accumulated in small
concentrations in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, my suspicion there is that
if there was some real benefit associated
[SPEAKER_01]: with this generation of electric field
that could help stimulate plant growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: nature probably would have found a way to
incorporate it into primary metabolism a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit further and to a more,
you know, deep extent than it currently is
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a very long time now, you know,
preceding the existence of any human on
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, plants have been doing this
photosynthesis thing with no help at all
[SPEAKER_01]: from copper wires that have been stuck
into the ground and generating electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Electrical fields can also impact the
functioning of certain like protein
[SPEAKER_01]: complexes and certain enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, these types of things are
typically not found in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plants have not really evolved ways
to optimize being exposed to these
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical fields in a way that like
massively increases their yield or
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why the results that you see out
there are so mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people swear by electroculture
because they have 25 foot tall corn plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and the ones that didn't get electrical
culture are only four or five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's other people who do the
exact same studies, basically,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they find no difference associated
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's not one of those
things that's like a primary driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say if if you have ionized nutrition
that could benefit from being exposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: an electrical field, then sure,
you'd see some benefit as far as nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not like this hidden portal where
you can access another level of your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants performance altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's that's a little bit of a
myth or a misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's again, there's
something interesting to be studied here
[SPEAKER_01]: and looked at in greater detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think we need to better
characterize what exactly these electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: fields are and how they work in the
context of nutrient metabolism,
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme activity, and certainly the
biosynthesis of some secondary metabolites
[SPEAKER_01]: that that might accumulate in higher
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think there's anything that's
really conclusive out there that proves it
[SPEAKER_01]: one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, plants have electron transport
chains, but that's fundamentally different
[SPEAKER_01]: than the way that copper conducts
electricity and creates an electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be interesting to see some future
studies that come out because I know
[SPEAKER_02]: people are studying it and I know people
are using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I look forward to seeing what what
people come up with in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, what an episode this has been.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it might actually be the longest
episode yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: We usually don't go this long,
but I wanted to continue because I was
[SPEAKER_02]: just so intrigued by this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a long list of things here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we touched upon a whole bunch
of different things that is really going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be valuable to the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a feeling that people in the
