[SPEAKER_00]: I always dry out my soil and I'll take it
out of the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw it into like a big like like
tubware tote, you know, like one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: really big totes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dump it in there and then I just
slide it under the exhausting on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: of my tent so that it's just constantly
drying out that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time I only feed from the
start of veg to the end of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I only feed two or three
times the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the last time I fed in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You top it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gave it too much food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too late already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well just start over,
you know, with a non-stunted plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you haven't run over with a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calm down about all the small stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you stay out of the plant's
way, it's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_03]: into my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Garden Talk episode five.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had a viewer request to put
this onto platforms that host podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Apple podcast, Spotify has podcasts,
Google podcasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to put this Garden Talk series
onto those platforms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, if you're just trying to
listen on YouTube on mobile, you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: actually just exit out of the app or else
the audio completely cuts off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So having this Garden Talk series onto
other platforms will allow people to tune
[SPEAKER_03]: in and be able to do other things while
they listen in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a great episode for you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of you out there have actually
requested for this guest to come onto the
[SPEAKER_03]: show.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes by Welcome to the Grow tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: He currently has a little over 20,000
subscribers on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we sat down and had a great talk for
almost an hour here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm super excited to bring you this
episode today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get into the episode,
I would like to give a shout out to our
[SPEAKER_03]: sponsor, our sponsor for today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today is Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Hydro is an online gardening store
from Buffalo, New York that has supported
[SPEAKER_03]: my channel for several years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take pride in their product
selection, their customer service,
[SPEAKER_03]: and ship most orders the same day.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have low prices and shipping is free
if you're making a purchase over $25.
[SPEAKER_03]: So head on over to happyhydro.com and I'll
leave a link down in the YouTube video
[SPEAKER_03]: description.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're tuning in there, you can
easily click on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, welcome to the Grow tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually had probably like eight or nine
people request you to come on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm super pumped that you came on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure the audience, you know,
particularly those people are going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: really happy that you came on here to join
me today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really love this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as far as like, you know,
in YouTube there can be a lot of toxic
[SPEAKER_00]: communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not really found that with this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you know, you get the
occasional trolls or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for the most part, this community is,
it's just fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love all the commenting,
the people, everybody's just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: help everybody out, trying to get their
plants better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the reasons why I
started this show or podcast is really to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, interview growers from all over
the world and kind of understand how they
[SPEAKER_03]: do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there are so many different ways
to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, your style is going to be
different from my style is going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: different from, you know, the other
person's style, other people's styles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, being able to talk with you
today, discuss your growing practices,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, other people will be able to
listen to this and potentially gain some
[SPEAKER_03]: ideas on what they can do to implement
into their gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it should be pretty beneficial
for a lot of people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say I have a pretty
different style than most.
[SPEAKER_00]: My main focus whenever I'm growing is,
and especially whenever I'm trying to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else how to do it, is strictly
simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and get it down just to the bare
knuckle part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what I was figuring out whenever I
first started the channel is everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: so stressed out in the emails I was
getting from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, look, you got to relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is a slow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be in there all hyped up and
angry and stressed out about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you're taking the completely wrong
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I was like, all right,
if I can just oversimplify this,
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, it'll help a ton of people
out, which is one of the main,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that was the main reason I
wanted to start the channel was just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to, you know, to share this plant
in my knowledge with it as much as I could
[SPEAKER_00]: with everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so maybe for the viewers who don't
know who you are, can you just tell us a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit about yourself and how you got
into growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody run a channel called Welcome to
the Grow Tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, we do a simplistic
approach on growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have really, really bad ADHD and anxiety
type issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never really liked buying stuff that
I didn't know where it came from,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was done to it before I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my things with ADHD, though,
is I will run off on tangents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I start to do that, you're going to
have to you have to bring me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to reel me back in because it's
like fireworks going off in my head almost
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll hear me in the videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell myself to calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opious because I just it's like a runaway
train that's picking 15 different tracks
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my main thing was with my anxiety is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally don't really like talking
about it, but with my anxiety is I never
[SPEAKER_00]: really liked just buying stuff from
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have any idea what they put in
it, what they did to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm not a big person that likes
taking medications either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, Dr. Prescribe prescribed
like Xanax or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just would mess me up for like 11
or 12 hours at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like my head was up in the
clouds and somebody else was doing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: down here on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, on the other hand, I can grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's been in it the whole time
because I'm the one that did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like that approach to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I really like all the
different strains and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this one's a little bit too head rushy
or too something, I can switch to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different strain and find, you know,
kind of like that perfect balance for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my that's my favorite part about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I got into growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The control and then because you could buy
something from somebody doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can tell you whatever you want,
but that doesn't mean that's what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do it all myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big control freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what it boiled down to.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, everybody, you know,
everybody has their own goals when it
[SPEAKER_03]: comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people go for yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people go for efficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had mentioned simplicity was a big
thing on your end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people are beginners and they just
want to get to their first grow and have
[SPEAKER_03]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, besides the simplicity thing,
which you already mentioned, do you have
[SPEAKER_03]: any other goals in mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you chase after a high yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't because it's not like I'm
selling or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield I found just comes with with the
more you stay out of the plant's way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less I like to say, the less you do,
the more you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the less you get out of its way,
the less you hurt it, the yield just
[SPEAKER_00]: comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow more than I could ever hope to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not I'm not selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every time I pull down the five
by five, it's two pounds and I run
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's constantly until I got my trimming
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a nightmare of trimming all day,
all night, just constant trim jail all all
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but it's I don't ever chase the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that usually by chasing something,
you get the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to just, you know, natural,
simplistic ways that stuff will all come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really don't like how the new people
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so hard on themselves whenever
they're starting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's another big thing I get
with my emails is they're they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at week three of this or week two of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants don't look anything like,
you know, what I'm seeing on the Internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, this guy here or this
guy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, these guys have been doing this
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have so much more practice than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what their plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a repetitive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get so down on yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: People they mess up the first time,
then they quit and sell all their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the same same boat as you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just grow for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't sell the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a caregiver or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually I live in a state where I'm
allowed to gift in the bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually says you're allowed to gift
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I actually had a friend in town
yesterday and he came into town.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a nice jar for him and he was his
eyes lit up and he was super pumped,
[SPEAKER_03]: super pumped.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I love to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, I just gift more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a bunch of people because just
from you know, they'll pick up cues here
[SPEAKER_00]: and there and they figure out where I'm
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had a bunch of people trying to
get me to do the caregiving, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: ask me to be the caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, man, if I had if I had
more time, I was like, but everything's so
[SPEAKER_00]: packed and everything in here already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess I guess I could start to do it and
just not even grow them plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: just give them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so much excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess I could, but I just
I'd never taken on that responsibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: being a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: For somebody else yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should, but I just haven't
because we don't have that gift thing
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just give people give people
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's let's let's talk about your your
current gross setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you tell me a little bit about your
setup?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, what size gross space,
lighting, some of the equipment you have,
[SPEAKER_03]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is gonna be a long part of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dedicated room in my unfinished
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the basement that I had built just
for growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything runs off its own,
has its own breaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each tent has its own breaker set up
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 14 by 16 room that I had finished
in my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all insulated drywall, you know,
nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never finished the drywall, but it is
mudded and taped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but I have four stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a germination station, you know,
Monty Dome with a little two foot T5 over
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two veg areas, which are two by
four tents, which will be coming down soon
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have some three by fives that
I'm going to be putting up that a new
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor sent me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to have to take down my old
two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have a five by five gorilla
tent that actually some of my awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon members sent to me because they
were tired to hear me complain about my
[SPEAKER_00]: old tent, which was a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a five by five and it had one
entrance just the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like to scrawl plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So only being I would have to lay down on
the ground and slide under the canopy to
[SPEAKER_00]: work on the plants in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge pain in the butt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess my patrons got so tired of
hearing me complain about this one
[SPEAKER_00]: entrance, you know, five by five is a
decent size tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 25 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my tents fill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill them out side to side, front to
back, the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no open space.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my tents, whenever I'm in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no other option except laying
on the ground like a freaking snake and
[SPEAKER_00]: charming my way back through the through
the buckets to get to the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got so sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me a gorilla tent, which now
opens the whole, you know, the whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: opens like 180 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a dream working in there now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much the extent the
two by fours will be coming down and light
[SPEAKER_00]: rail, the company light rail, they just
sent me their tents with their light rail
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be doing those in the future grow
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as lights go, I used to be a huge,
hugely against LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really wasn't about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was mainly about some of the
information that was out there on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people just put them too close
and they're miniaturizing, miniaturizing
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have been growing with them lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually pretty in love with them now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 16 bulb T5 from bad boy or
quantum, whatever it used to be called.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both out of business now,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually have that in my five by
five because a 16 bulb T5 is freaking
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like a little over four by
four in area just by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have that in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that for veg only or do you flower with
that too?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to flower with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was flowering with it just for content
to show people that it doesn't matter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what light you got, you can do
whatever you want with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got a really good video.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two pounds of plant finished dried
plant from T5 from fluorescent lights is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of wanted to show people
that, you know, whatever you had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could finish runs with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, that was kind of the reason
that I bought that giant, that giant T5
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for new people, I like to tell them to
get T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the most forgiving light that you
could, that you could be under and will it
[SPEAKER_00]: cost you some in yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course T5 spreads it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, if, if you're
burning your plants up, it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: how nice of a light you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're killing your stuff by blasting
it with too much light too soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't matter what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're killing your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The equipment, it doesn't matter anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I just kind of, but I grow
with T5s, LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I'm not, I don't, I'm not picky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever I have, if that's what they want
me to grow with, I'll put that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can, I can figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like how you mentioned that you do it
for content because that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of, a lot of viewers don't really
realize that some of us content creators
[SPEAKER_03]: will do certain things specifically for
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with like CO2, I don't hardly ever
run CO2, but like TNB, they had contacted
[SPEAKER_00]: me in the past just because I already can,
the plants will produce so much already.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I add CO2 to it, it just ups my yield
and I have, I don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just don't need the extra,
but you know, somebody's going to send me
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and pay me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it in the tent, but I don't,
I don't need the CO2 because I already get
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, content's content.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to try and try and be as honest as
possible whenever I'm on the, whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, whenever I'm on stream, I figure
there's enough, you know, lying on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on videos already, not just in this,
in any, it's anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to be upfront and honest with
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to tell people my plants are
a young age when they're actually way
[SPEAKER_00]: older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to do any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like, you know, if they, they're three
weeks, they're three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're nine weeks, they're nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just try and be honest and
upfront with everybody and have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about some, some other equipment?
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe, you know, how many oscillating
fans are you running inline fans?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to run a dehumidifier or a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the, let's see on the big tent,
obviously it's going to have way more fans
[SPEAKER_00]: than the Lillard tents on the big tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two six inch fans that sit at the
top, just kind of keep some air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have an AC infinity, the six series
cloud line, whatever the one with the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the S series maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's the T six, I believe is the
one with the controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's the T series S series is the
manual one, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the T series with the controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got that up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you what, I didn't even put the
pre-filter on it because the filter looks
[SPEAKER_00]: so freaking cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're black and chrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't bring myself to put,
I was like, this is going to shorten the
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, this thing looks so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't cover it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all black and chrome looking on my
pants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got two fans, two like six inch
hurricane fans sitting up top,
[SPEAKER_00]: just attached, just pushing the air,
you know, circulating some air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like dead space air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a tower fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a tower fan is probably my
favorite fan for groves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them right down there in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a blade of air that as the plant
gets taller, you know, that air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, it stays just, it has that
straight collar column of air that
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly goes through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a tower fan is probably my
favorite of all the fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have like a 12 inch fan that
just stays underneath the canopy and just
[SPEAKER_00]: rotates around down by the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want stale, stagnant air and water
anywhere together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want constant air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as relative humidity, this is where
a lot of people on YouTube yell at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't, I don't ever, you know,
in the summertime, it's way different than
[SPEAKER_00]: in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like adding humidifiers or
dehumidifiers or anything unless I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm drying and curing, it's really the
only time I pay attention to relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of flack on that in my comment
section.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of videos where I'm
taking hammers and just blasting apart
[SPEAKER_00]: hygrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you know, just don't,
don't even worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you've got problems, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I get a lot of flack on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, we're bringing it back to
simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they get so stressed,
everybody gets so stressed out about,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, well, my room's only 60% relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were trying to get to 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop stressing out about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the end of the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have mold problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got any kind of problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: No?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have problems showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just, I try and de-stress
every situation that I can and simplify it
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can that stuff help you in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're starting out, you know,
relax, calm down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, keep it simple, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do the kiss method, kiss method
with everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you do grow in soil, cocoa coir,
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am strictly soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to tell everybody whenever,
cause I do focus on like brand brand new
[SPEAKER_00]: people is who my channel is mainly focused
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less steps that you have to do
because I transplant all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time I tell people every time you
transplant, you're feeding the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can get you to transplant your
plants appropriately, most of the time I
[SPEAKER_00]: only feed from the start of veg to the end
of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times I only feed two or three
times the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember the last time I fed in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get RO water and cow mag is basically
what they get all of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whenever I transplant them into
flower into their final pods, I'll go from
[SPEAKER_00]: like, so I started in veg and happy frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then whenever I go to flower,
I'll put them into ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just let that run out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it lasts till about week three of
flower before I start to see my runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll start feeding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I've made it to week three of
flower and I cut off nutrients at week six
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower, and then I'd let them just
coast out on what's in the, what's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: leftover in the pot and, you know,
let them fade out naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one less thing that new growers have
to concern themselves with is the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the amount of questions I get on
nutrient schedules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, listen, I can help you avoid all
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to let just, just transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly into, you know, as soon as you
outgrow your pot, put it into a new one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've just fed it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to concern you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to get so worked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did a video where I'm taking
all the nutrients and I'm just throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: them off the table into a trash can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, here's just, you can,
if I can tell you a way to eliminate 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: of your headache, why wouldn't you take
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's going to come out great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you add stuff in there as long as
you're not burning your stuff up with too
[SPEAKER_00]: many nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it, will it help?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever you're brand new,
the less steps you got to do is the less
[SPEAKER_00]: often, you know, it's the less chance you
have to mess one of them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, simplicity once again.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, uh, happy frog in the beginning,
and then you eventually work your way into
[SPEAKER_03]: ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one thing that was interesting about
that is that you said you get all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: up into week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question for you now is what size
grow pots are you using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, um, I do transplant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And multiple times you started in like a
solo cup and go to like a one gallon,
[SPEAKER_03]: then to like a five gallon or seven
gallon, or what are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually start in route, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever they're in the germination dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I'll move into solo cups
after like three weeks in the queue,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll move them into solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I, I hate the solo cup stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I overwater them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never get the feeling right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like I'm constantly messing up in
the solo cup stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I only keep them in the solo cup stage
for like a week or two, and then I'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm right into a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm in the one gallon, I feel at
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my weights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pick them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how long they, I know what they,
I know what they need when it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: once they hit one gallon, I'm smooth
sailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get them out of the, out of the
dome, out of the solo cups and into the
[SPEAKER_00]: one gallons and a weight just drops off
the back of my shoulders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm out of those terrible solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I'll go from the one gallon and
then depending on where I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some sponsors like, uh, you know,
want me to flower veg and flower in their
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't always come out of the two by
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I have to stay in the two by
four for veg and for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to determine what size
pots I'm going to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also going to depend on the
number of plants I'm running.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running, if I'm in a two by four
and I'm running, you know, three to five
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, I'm only going to put them in,
in three gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm running, you know, two plants or
one plant, I will transition from a one to
[SPEAKER_00]: a three to a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't ever go over five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I'm in the, even if I'm in the big
one, five gallons is a, is a ton of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I step it up maybe to a seven?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to deal with that much soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the bigger pots,
bigger water, you know, it's more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just more, more,
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dislike more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want less, less, less whenever I'm doing
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I assume that, well, I shouldn't
assume, but are you in plastic containers
[SPEAKER_03]: all the way through, or is your final
container like a fabric pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it actually depends on what I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have fabric pots, I put them in
fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, once again, I'm not, I don't
really, it doesn't bother me either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do, I'll do plastic one gallons,
plastic three, I prefer fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I don't happen to have any,
which happens to me quite a quite often,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually the plastic pots, you know,
rinse out and you can use them again with
[SPEAKER_00]: the fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a really simple way to get them
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I just razor knife around the edge of
the thing and just peel it off like a
[SPEAKER_00]: banana because the roots grow into it so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can make it a pain in the butt with the
bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with like, if you're in a three
gallon or something, the last thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do is be trying to peel that thing
out, you know, pull that, get that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there with the roots all grown into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going from a three to a five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for my final, I usually try and be in a
fabric, but if I don't have one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really, it doesn't bother me
either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do prefer the fabric though,
because like whenever you pull one out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a fabric pot, you don't have the coiling
of the roots around there because they
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, they hit the edge of the pot and
then they air prune themselves and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow out differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: When even the plastic and you pull them
out, it looks so much cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you pull it out, you got just the
roots everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pull them out of the fabric and it's
just like a big bundle of dirt mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it looks way cooler coming out of the
plastic, but I don't really care either
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do it in both.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use both plastic and fabric pots,
whatever I kind of have on hand or feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like using for that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like you mentioned before,
it's for content, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm doing the same thing over and over
and over again in all my videos,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, then people are getting bored of my
content and then click off.
[SPEAKER_03]: So trying new things, using new methods
just to show the audience that it can be
[SPEAKER_03]: done in so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'm always, I scrog the plants
out, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a video series where it was,
I called it the Pungy Pitta Death series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all the bamboo stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't use the scrog and I just,
I tried to control them and hold them all
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hated it, but I like scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like scrogging my plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the level of control I get
from it is, I find it way more to my
[SPEAKER_00]: liking than with the Pungy Pitta.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a lot harder to control without
the scrog there to keep everybody tied
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I like uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the control of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like everybody even and flat across my
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely helps maintain an even
canopy when you're bending those branches
[SPEAKER_03]: down.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have that flat net to kind of
tuck things over and stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a lot of people, the downside they
say is like, okay, now what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to like crawl under in order to
kind of water the plants behind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it does have like a downside on that
avenue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, whenever I had the tent with
only the one entrance, I had a system of
[SPEAKER_00]: metal poles that I would hook onto my
water jug and I would just slide the poles
[SPEAKER_00]: through the canopy to the back ones and
water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those days are over.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gorilla tent opens completely up so I
can get to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, literally it peels to 180 degrees
and just the back wall is the only one
[SPEAKER_00]: that stays up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most fantastic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not like a little door that opens.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole tent just peels off the whole
sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you mentioned watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of water do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: You use a reverse osmosis, tap water,
well water, distilled?
[SPEAKER_00]: My tap water here before my water softener
is 400 and 30 ppm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, mine's 485.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, after the water softener,
it's almost a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mine, I was using just gallons of
distilled water and it was just so many
[SPEAKER_00]: trips to the grocery store getting gallons
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just broke down and bought an RO
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, best money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to spend crazy amounts of
money on everything because I like to try
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep it simple of course, but there's
some things when you're growing like that
[SPEAKER_00]: tent that are worth every single penny.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things that you just need
like buying a proper pH and ppm pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to constantly mess with
your stuff wondering if it's right or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certain areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spend the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one of those RO systems underneath
my kitchen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only is it for drinking water,
clean drinking water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to buy bottled waters anymore
so I save money there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the savings, the calculations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just calculating what I would consume in
bottled water versus my RO system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spend about $250 per year on just
bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's your RO system right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: RO system I think was like 175 or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expensive piece and whenever I'm
talking to new growers, it's an expensive
[SPEAKER_00]: because when they think of spending money,
they want to spend it on their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm telling you, this RO
machine, they're worth every penny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whichever one you want to get,
they're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like, once again, the control it brings
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what that plant is getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've had 300 ppm or 250 ppm
from your tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's probably calcium and
magnesium, but you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fluoride or whatever else
in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like knowing exactly what I'm
giving my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're happier because of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can build my nutrient profile,
not whoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically whatever's on sale, but it's
mainly just general hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: three-part.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, if a place came on board and
said, we want you to use our nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured out it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: A nutrient profile is a nutrient profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a week with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have it squared away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you following the general hydroponics
nutrient schedule that they put out on
[SPEAKER_03]: their website or do a half dose or what do
you do for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing auto flowers, I don't give
them full doses of anything ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 25% when they're little and I'm 50%
when they're older.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feed them every week because once
again, I'm in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my photo periods, I do grow them
rather big, healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll follow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm feeding that week, I'll just follow
whatever their chart says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I need to add to something else or
mix it up a little bit, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, once again, I keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you monitor the pH and the PPM or EC
values at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super strict on my PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever like feeding my bigger plants
more than 600, 650 at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that whenever I go over that,
the tips of my leaves will start to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: that brown and start to get a little
nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, feeding is not something I
do a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have bottles of nutrients that I've had
for a year or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start to crystallize on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I buy the big bottles, they'll start to
crystallize on the bottom before I even
[SPEAKER_00]: get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because growing in soil, it's a step
that you don't have to pay that much
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to because you're not feeding a
ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main things I really like is I
constantly give microbes my mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will go through a bunch of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing a soil drench with the
mycorrhizae or are you just sprinkling on
[SPEAKER_03]: the roots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I transplant, I'll sprinkle it on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll maybe throw some granular version in
the pot whenever I transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then anytime I'm watering, I give them
mycorrhizae every two weeks from the start
[SPEAKER_00]: till week six of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, they get more drenched
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I just throw some flora blend or some
plant food or some food for them to eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the occasional blackstrap molasses,
something to keep them happy and just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use a particular brand of
mycorrhizae or just whatever you have on
[SPEAKER_03]: hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Great White mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much what all the grow
stores around here have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seven grow stores within a
40-minute drive of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been pretty fantastic since our state
went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of grow stores, it used to be I
had to just order it and now they're
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow stores are a little bit more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I happily go to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like supporting the business in local
brick and mortar shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happily go into all of them and buy
different stuff at different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mainly Great White, a little
blackstrap, and some general hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: three-part.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I use the most of is probably a cow
mag bottle and then towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, mag sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I burn through that stuff so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes through a hundred times the rate I
use the regular NPK stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the blackstrap molasses, what do you
do for a dosage per gallon of water,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pour some in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just get a couple of glugs and call it a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big on being super strict with
that kind of stuff because who cares if
[SPEAKER_00]: you give it a little bit too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: The mycorrhizae get a little bit extra
fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then just go back to the PPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned 600 PPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that going in and do you measure the
runoff PPM as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I measure both because I like to see
where my plants are at.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your plants are starting to get too
low, usually anytime when I'm in flower
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't really pay attention to it
when I'm in veg because they're constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: getting transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I'm in flower and I see my runoff
start to dip below 800, I know it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're up anywhere over 1200,
1300, I just let it go until I see my
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff start to drop, then I feed them,
which isn't very often because I
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do a runoff test, you don't do a
slurry test at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'd literally just stick my PPM pin
down into whatever my runoff water is and
[SPEAKER_00]: see where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worked good for me so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get too complicated with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which PPM pin do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a cheap one off Amazon or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one on my website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually know the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it at welcometothegrowtent
.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then pH, do you monitor the pH going in or
runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing I could yell that
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very strict with my PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's above 5.0 and below 7.0,
I give it to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found was it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I edited all at 6.9 for like a month and
my runoff would still come out at like
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.8, 6.1, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not that strict with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things I get yelled about
in the comments so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, you got to be between
6.1 and 6.3, that's the golden spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be that strict with it,
what do I care?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just showing you how I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm above, if I'm at 5.1, I feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm at 6.9, I feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pour it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not something I stress too much
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be adding, I'm like,
oh, I'm adding up to put the pH up in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over 6.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I got to put some pH down in it and
I'll put some alkaline in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave all that rollercoaster stuff
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got tired of dumping out buckets of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't concern myself too much with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm into my range that I like,
then I give it to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then I'll add some stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, particularly for growing in Fox
Farms soil, one thing I noticed is that a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of these bags, they're coming in low.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming in at 5.
[SPEAKER_03]: something pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had them in mid-bores.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Me, personally, I usually just feed in at
6.5, 6.8 pH and then it will slowly drift
[SPEAKER_03]: up over time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, things like the microbes will
adjust the pH and the medium as well over
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's interesting that you will feed in
within 5.0 to 6.0 pH because typically
[SPEAKER_03]: that's said to be a little bit too low
when growing in soil, but you're having
[SPEAKER_03]: success with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually heard about other people
doing that as well with a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it where I went in at 6.1 to
6.4, constantly was super strict with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never noticed an end yield difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, let's try it the other
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did grows where I only came in at
5.1 to 5.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super strict with it down low and I
didn't notice a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I noticed was that what the
soil would do with the runoff would change
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make their own environment and they
make it the way they want it and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: happy as long as you don't fry them with a
4.0 or something that gets everybody angry
[SPEAKER_00]: with you because I did try that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, how low can I go?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out of the force.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were not happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about temperature?
[SPEAKER_03]: What temperature do you use the aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm comfortable in there, I'm fine with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 70s, 80s, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, it's not a thing I'm terribly
strict with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that video where I'm smashing
the hygrometer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if it's too hot for me in here,
I don't want to be in here, so I stay out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep them comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can be comfortable in there,
they're comfortable and we're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, the emails that I get with
people with the pH is in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the relative humidity and the temp and
they're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're putting heaters in there and then
running air conditioners in the daytime
[SPEAKER_00]: and heaters at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, unless you live in some kind of
crazy climate, don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop stressing so much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get you there to the end yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get through this, I promise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in a desert climate, so summertime,
for example, I have to actually implement
[SPEAKER_03]: an air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually try to take off July and August
potentially.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just try to not grow just because it's
so much less money spending on electricity
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: I aim for about 82 leaf surface
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I read to be ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, the plant is going to grow
in a different range than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some can actually take a little bit more
than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some can take less than that, just fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a heater in my grow space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to go below 60 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in the 60s, I see the purpling of
streaks in the stems in the low 60s
[SPEAKER_03]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do regulate on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example about how you can get away
with not doing those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stay out of its way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not blasting it with too many
nutrients, flipping on the lights to full
[SPEAKER_00]: power when the plant's still little,
and watering, just soaking it down with
[SPEAKER_00]: water every single day, you'd be surprised
how well they'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you eventually up your yield by
honing in on some of these things more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, my channel is focused at very
beginners where I'm just trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get them through.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been getting maybe five to 10% of
what their plants could yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can bump you from five to 10% up to
70%, I've never had a single person that
[SPEAKER_00]: was mad at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've mentioned certain humidity levels on
my channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like you where it's just a
general range for beginners because I do
[SPEAKER_03]: have a lot of people that are following
what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that a lot of people are
shifting towards is VPD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure how much you know about VPD,
but VPD is a scientifically proven method
[SPEAKER_03]: for humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Typically, that calls for a higher
humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gotten flack on my channel in the
past where I had said, I can't entirely
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend that people chase after VPD
because it does call for high humidity in
[SPEAKER_03]: some instances.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have that air circulation
going on, if you have stagnant air,
[SPEAKER_03]: if a fan dies overnight like it's happened
to me, you can get powdery mildew very
[SPEAKER_03]: easily, bud rot, and completely ruin your
crop if you have mold in your buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my point with it is don't chase
VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever you're a beginner, once again,
I'm speaking to beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been growing for 10 years,
keep doing what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a beginner, mold's going to
ruin your grow way faster than VPD because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're a beginner, most likely you're
going to overwater your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But powdery mildew is going to ruin your
entire garden way faster than if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not paying attention to keeping your VPD
perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get yelled at a ton about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally don't even talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2, you think you mentioned earlier that
you don't do any type of CO2, you don't do
[SPEAKER_03]: any supplementation at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: It ups my yield by about 15% to 20%,
and I already get too much to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I going to do with an extra four
or five ounces?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I'm having trouble getting
through the two pounds, I just cut down
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I generally don't run it if a sponsor
sends it in there or if I want to show
[SPEAKER_00]: people the benefits of adding it in the
videos, then I'll put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, not really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what about plant training?
[SPEAKER_03]: You had mentioned you like to do a trellis
net.
[SPEAKER_03]: You use stakes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do any low stress training,
supercropping?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you do for plant training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I scrawl whenever they go into
flower, but my main plant training
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques is topping, fimming,
and supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my bread and butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I get all my plant training
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of the wire ties and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found with topping my plants,
they grow so many branches so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really want to have 30 wire ties
running around the plant just because the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants will branch out so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mainly just topping and supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll top the plants, supercrop the top
half of the plant down to let the lower
[SPEAKER_00]: half catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually after a few weeks of that,
they're ready to flip the flower anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know this, but I think you're
primarily indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they don't let me grow outdoors
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, if you want to grow
outdoors, you have to build a building to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, that's called indoors and
I already have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about IPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, indoors, we have the luxury of not
having to do as much.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get away with doing a little bit
less.
[SPEAKER_03]: When it comes to IPM, do you do anything
in particular to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do actually a couple things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing is I always dry out my soil
whenever I get my soil out of the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't dry it out, I've got videos of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it and I'll get it out of the
bags is the first thing I do because those
[SPEAKER_00]: bags hold in moisture and I'll take it out
of the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll throw it into a big tubware tote,
one of the really big totes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll dump it in there and then I just
slide it under the exhausting on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: of my tent so that it's just constantly
drying out that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that soil gets too dry, anything that
was like fungus gnats or anything were in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, they lose their food source so they
either die or leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing I do is I just air
out the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every couple of days, I'll go in there and
I'll stir it up under the vent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big tip here, pull it out from under the
vent before you start stirring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you get giant clouds of soil in
your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stir it up, mix the wet stuff back up to
the top and I slide it back under there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let my prep like that go for about a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I know I'm going to transplant,
I'll get my new soil and I'll put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: those totes and start drying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next thing and pretty much the only
other thing I do is I yell that about the
[SPEAKER_00]: way I say this word because I mess it up
every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like adding razor wire into your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I transplant, I top dress with the
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think overwatering is what leads to a
lot of your problems with bugs and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever overwater unless I'm in solo
cups, then I still overwater because I
[SPEAKER_00]: just hate them.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the diatomaceous earth in there,
and just keeping big green healthy plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: knock on wood, I've never had a problem
since I started doing just those two
[SPEAKER_00]: simple things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just actually got some diatomaceous
earth for the first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never used it before, so I'm going to
have to potentially steal your best
[SPEAKER_03]: practice there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's literally the best thing ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it in my live stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of my transplanting videos just
on a live stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was like, what is that yellow
bag that you have sitting next that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: mixing in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I transplant the plant into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, how much do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grab a handful of it and sprinkle
it all around the pot and then top dress
[SPEAKER_00]: it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just throw it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it's going to hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally like adding razor wire into
your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a time where I've been slacking
in the garden and I haven't had time to
[SPEAKER_00]: dry my soil out, I actually just take a
bunch of handfuls of it, throw it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: tote, and just mix it throughout all the
soil, not just top dress with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it pretty much anytime I've got new
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really interesting that you dry out
your soil like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pretty good tip.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these bags of soils come with
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what they think.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grow in Fox Farmer as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a hit or miss for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some bags I'll plant in and then I'll be
growing the plant and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus gnats start to arise.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have the yellow sticky traps and then
I'll dry out the soil while the plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just dry it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't water the plant to the point where
it's kind of underwatered and then water
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then pretty much off of one drying out,
they're pretty much gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will leave instantaneously.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second they lose their food,
the food source with drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dry them out too much, all the eggs
and stuff die.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dry them out just one time,
they leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you start overwatering again,
more will come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can smell that algae and stuff that's
growing in your soil and they will come
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by drying it out, I've found that
I've eliminated the problem because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been times where I watered one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two days later, I had fungus gnats come
out of the dang thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, if they're already in the bags,
there's no other explanation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I figured that out, it made the world
of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't bought a sticky trap in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any sprays for IPM or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a bottle of SNS 209 that I opened
up one time whenever I first started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I've started drying the soil out and
adding the diatomaceous earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I added the diatomaceous earth,
I just call it DE usually on the stream so
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get yelled at about the way I
pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since I did that, that bottle of SNS 209
just sits on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is I don't bring anybody's
clones into my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the biggest transfer of
bugs that people get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get into your house,
it's almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll spray the whole house down with
Azimax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever bring anybody's clones into
my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever hear nothing but horror
stories from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh yeah, I went and got these clones
and now I have spider mites everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll burn the house down if I get spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want nothing to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people don't realize how well it
works to just keep things clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: For me personally, between grows,
I'll literally wipe everything down with a
[SPEAKER_03]: bleach cleaning product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do bleach solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every tent, every light, every fixture,
every cord, once again, I'm in my control
[SPEAKER_00]: and ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ADHD pays off in this part of my thing
because I'll sit there and I detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: orient, clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in between grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, while I'm growing, I do get messy
through the week because working regular
[SPEAKER_00]: full-time job, coming up with content,
shooting it, editing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have my family also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets hectic through the week and then
Sundays I spend cleaning up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got a couple more questions for you
before we end this.
[SPEAKER_03]: New growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You work with a lot of new growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Primarily, your channel really focuses on
the beginner.
[SPEAKER_03]: What advice do you have for someone who is
just starting to grow for the first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't spend a ton of money on the certain
things you can, but don't spend a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: money right off the bat until you figure
out if this is for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to go out and buy a $2,000
light right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calm down about all the small stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you stay out of the plant's
way, it's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever run into any problems,
I put my email up in all my videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get about a thousand emails a day,
as anybody can imagine, anybody that puts
[SPEAKER_00]: their email up in every video on the
internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them nice, but most of them,
the majority of them are nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try and work through them as much as I
can, but if I don't respond to you in a
[SPEAKER_00]: few days, send it again because it's been
buried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just relax would be my biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be in your tent 10 times
a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say that on my videos all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need you on top of it
constantly messing with it all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretend it's a fern in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you pay attention to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, oh, it's getting kind of
droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you got to do a little bit more than
that, but I'm just telling you,
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave it the heck alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do what it's going to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to start to read
what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would rather have you do way too less
than way too much because it's way easier
[SPEAKER_00]: to fix way too less than it is to fix way
too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you top it down too much,
you gave it too much food, it's too late
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well just start over with a
non-stunted plant that you haven't run
[SPEAKER_00]: over with a truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always chuckle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a forum on my website, mrgroot.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have people freely post up questions
they have or grow journals and so on and
[SPEAKER_03]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been times where people have
commented, their seedling just sprouted
[SPEAKER_03]: and they get panicky so quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, last hour, my leaves
were at a 90 degree angle and now it
[SPEAKER_03]: adjusted 30 degrees and I don't know
what's going on with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest thing is that first week,
I don't even open the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave the dome on and I tell everybody,
I go, don't open it till the next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they pop out of ground,
that's day one of your seedling stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: just leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't even open the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep the dome on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't need anything from you because
what's going to happen is you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch it and you're going to break it
because you've got giant man hands and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to snap that little thing and
you're going to hurt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing you can do to it that it
can't figure out how to do on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Grow Tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any other areas where they can
find you, any other social media that you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to shout out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Grow Tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stream on Twitch every Friday and
Sunday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit, I'm kind of animated in
real life, but I'm a lot more animated in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of take on a Ric Flair personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear me in my videos all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big wrestling fans over here in this
household, especially the Nature Boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Nature Boy, the Rolex wearing,
but you can find me on Twitch on Friday
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sunday nights, 10 PM Eastern.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any time I die, which is quite often,
whenever I'm playing Warzone happens all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I'm dead or in the lobby,
they got a live chat on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit there and answer hours and hours and
hours of Grow questions all Friday and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunday night on the Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the same kind of live stream that
you would have on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I actually tagged my YouTube
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I broadcast there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can ask your questions right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just sit there and I go over them
all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half the time I die because I start
reading the questions while I'm playing
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get yelled at by my teammates all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just have a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hang out with me on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I do have a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great little site.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do love the Patreon members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a Discord on there that are for
the Patreon members.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love this community and I have a
lot of fun doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything else on your channel
that you have upcoming that you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, we've got our granddaddy,
Purple, that we're growing in the 555.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my GPM, which is my giant purple
monster, my own strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to cross those two
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am going to get the purple into my giant
purple monster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't come out the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to breed the purple into this
dang plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can follow us along as I go trial
and error through trying to become a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see me do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have grows coming up on light rail
light movers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people there sent me brand new tents
that are just designed for their light
[SPEAKER_00]: movers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got that coming up and just me
constantly yelling at myself to relax and
[SPEAKER_00]: slow down and deal with all the people
that like to yell at me on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, welcome to The Grow Tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for coming onto my
channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a great talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is kind of a refresher for a
lot of people, especially the beginners
[SPEAKER_03]: who are trying to overcomplicate things.
[SPEAKER_03]: To hear somebody with experience that
really takes a pretty big hands off
[SPEAKER_03]: approach with a lot of these things that
are constantly being fed to them that they
[SPEAKER_03]: need to narrow down and be real specific
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the four stations going at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's times I don't go in the grow
room for two, three, four days at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: just because I know where everything's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't need any help from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my topping, my super cropping,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when they need to be watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just don't spend a lot of time in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just in there growing all by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to take credit for it,
but it's just nature just doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will link his channels down in the
