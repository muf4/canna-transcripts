[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the Garden Talk podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Luke McAllen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are all over Instagram, all over
Twitch, and YouTube, and the chat,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are a very active member of the
community, I must say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been awesome to watch you guys,
and I'm new to social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started one, I think, back in July,
and I just started following all you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: that I watched on YouTube over the years,
and just amazing the interaction and how
[SPEAKER_01]: alive the community was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fun to be a part of,
and I catch myself at work getting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram like, no, I'm at work right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been awesome to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually submitted some
photography in for my book as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think you had a picture or two in my
newest book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to thank you for submitting in
the photography, and yeah, it was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool to have you a part of the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was an honor.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got that message, I high-stepped it
across the field to my partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_01]: He works with me, and we're doing our
thing on the side, and he just couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: stop laughing because I high-stepped,
Mr. Crowett picked my picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate it for letting me be a
part of the whole process, and you got me
[SPEAKER_01]: the signed book, and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you introduce yourself for the
audience here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so my name's Luke, and I've been
around gardening my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always felt like I had a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom was always in the garden in the
backyard making compost and just watching
[SPEAKER_01]: her flip the pile and see the steam come
off was just, it was crazy to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I got older, you know, he had to
find a job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got into landscaping, and I did that
for several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my daughter, I had a daughter pretty
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was about 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was diagnosed with spina bifida
and hydrocephalus, and I won't go too deep
[SPEAKER_01]: into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that kind of was like, okay,
what can I do for alternative medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they wanted to give her this,
this, that, and the other thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not a big pill guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's other alternative sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started doing my research,
and that's when I came across your channel
[SPEAKER_01]: and Jeremy's channel, The Build a Soil,
and I started reading more about
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening, and it was just a pipe dream at
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in Indiana, and I had a really
good job, and I travel for work nonstop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom, a few years later, she passed of
cancer, and she was always a big green
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, me and my buddy Matt, we grew up in
diapers together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just came up with a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, you know what, we're gonna move
to Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna start our own CBD company,
CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start learning how to garden, and so we
both moved to Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved about a year and a half ago,
and Matt followed me about six months
[SPEAKER_01]: later, and we just dove full head in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we bought everything we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably overdid it a little bit,
but we wanted to do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't just growing the
medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to start our own thing,
and we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just full on went at it, and I tried
the synthetic for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't go so well just because of
traveling for work and staying up on top
[SPEAKER_01]: of the pH and the watering and the runoff,
and so then I started switching to
[SPEAKER_01]: organics, and I think, Jeremy,
for his 10 by 10 channel, it changed the
[SPEAKER_01]: way I grow and how I think about life in
general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say your style of gardening
is fully organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors only?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing outdoors as well,
and are you in soil or cocoa or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Michigan, so it's a little cold
over here most of the year, but I'm a
[SPEAKER_01]: fully organic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed the Build the Soil Away path to
the fullest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what they're doing over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I needed more hands-off gardening,
and with the organics and the larger
[SPEAKER_01]: volumes of soil, which I have two
60-gallon beds and a 30-gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it allows watering to ... I can space
it out a little bit more and get away with
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and organics is really what I wanted
to get into today with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at your Instagram, and it's just
fully organic, and you see very healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and I think that's a great topic
for today, which is organic gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easier said than done, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when I first started growing
organics, I didn't know that you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the soil moist the entire time in
order for that proper amendment breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't told that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was told, hey, add this fertilizer,
top dress, just water it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still doing drive-backs between
waterings, and found out that was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had deficiencies on the plants,
and there are little things like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: you really have to abide by in order to
make sure that your plants are healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into all of those
things in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to start with container size,
because you mentioned you're in two
[SPEAKER_00]: 60-gallons, and then you're in one
30-gallon, so larger containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they fabric pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of containers are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're the grassroots fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows for breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that liner down at the bottom so
you don't get so much runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been great to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the larger volume of soil,
you're able to have a bigger buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not worrying about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can follow a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that size and starting with a
balanced recipe is the key, is balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can go less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like me, I travel for work, so I don't do
nothing but water only during the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the weekends, I'll give it a treat or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm in that larger volume of soil,
I can get away with that, as long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture is at the right level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I do cheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the EcoWit soil meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me reads in my phone so I can
relay to the wife, hey, we need to water
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's often said that being in a
larger container is easier when growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally started out in a ...
Actually, I tried it in a three-gallon and
[SPEAKER_00]: five-gallon and even put it in one gallon
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to try it and get some experience and
see that it is a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging than it is growing in a
seven-gallon or 10-gallon is what I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple beds actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a two-by-ten bed outdoors that I
grow my vegetables in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same exact living soil one that you
have from a grass-root side pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a bed that I'm getting launched
up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-by-four, two-by-four grow tent
bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how many gallons are in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you said 30 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the one that's in your
four-by-four, but is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: three-by-three bed?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the 30-gallon I have in my
three-by-three tent, and it's just around
[SPEAKER_01]: 30-gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got the two five-by-five tents when
I got the three-by-three grass-root beds
[SPEAKER_01]: in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the 60-gallon, the
three-by-three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for your soil mix, what's in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do to begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I cheated again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went straight through Bill of Soil,
and I got their take and bake recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, if I'm going to do this,
not knowing much about organics at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought just learn as I go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the best balance recipes,
and that's what I've learned from watching
[SPEAKER_01]: the YouTube series.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the Clasmacutes mix, the artesian
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got everything in it, your aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the one-to-one-to-one ratio,
your base, your compost, and your
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got worm castings in it, biochar with
rootwise inoculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got pumice, rice holes, sphagnum peat
moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was where I struggled, too,
was the sphagnum peat moss, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just gave this thing this much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it still thirsty?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a struggle there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it's a take and bake mix,
which is Clasmacute, one-to-one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your one-part peat you're using
for the aeration using both pumice and
[SPEAKER_00]: rice holes, and then you've got everything
else, worm castings, biochar, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does that last you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to imagine that there's some
nutrition in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, is there any additional
amendments in there as well for
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's the build-a-soil mineral kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got your basalt and oyster shell,
and then the Clasmacute nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what he used in the kelp, the caranja.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first run I did, I gave it some
rootwise at the beginning, and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: would give it some ferments, or I threw in
your guy's a stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on my second run now, and I'm about
week six of flower, and I did the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, well, I re-amended, my fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did re-amend after that first run,
which is the build-a-soil way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do no soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave it your compost, build-a-flower,
worm castings, and that pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: planted right into that and started again,
and now I'm in week six of flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just giving it treats on the weekend,
and it's crushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I did break down an order of soil
tests, I think I am gonna get one after
[SPEAKER_01]: the second run just to make sure,
you know, I haven't tested my water,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I don't know if I have a sodium
buildup, or, you know, just to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: learn the whole process and how you go
amending, which is cool that they offer
[SPEAKER_01]: this now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have consultants, so you can meet
with the soil doctor or Zach Branson and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually work with them and kind of figure
out what this soil test is saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've looked them up online,
and they are beyond me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are in depth, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a ton of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually met the soil doctor,
Brian Mason, at the Soil Summit not too
[SPEAKER_00]: long ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great guy, and he has a ton of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So soil testing, super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water testing is another thing that isn't
really talked about enough, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get into water here in a little bit,
but as far as your, when you put in that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial take and bake, eventually the
nutrients are gonna deplete, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when do you put in your first feeding,
and what does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: I stick with the Kraft Blend, the 352.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, I think, it's 15 of their
favorite ingredients that they've made
[SPEAKER_01]: work in all in one, and that's pretty much
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as far as top dressing,
I do Kraft Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do a defoliation or a chop and drop,
I'll throw some Kashi Blend on there with
[SPEAKER_01]: just a compost accelerator, kind of get
everything active and going, but as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: feedings, I just stick to the ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do give a little bit of Build-A-Bloom in
the middle of flour, which is a water
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mix in the Chapin and water in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got amino acids and really built on
getting calcium, phosphorus, and potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than feedings, I really don't do
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the re-amend water treats on weekend,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, I've had luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I think I'm gonna get a soil
test where I get too deep and realize,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man, I just depleted everything,
because Jeremy does talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, feeding the whole buffet and
letting the plant do what it's want,
[SPEAKER_01]: never let it run out and kind of stay up
on top of that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So balance is everything when it comes to
these organic beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been using the Kraft Blend for
several years, and that's an awesome mix
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to just use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I top test every 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it every 30 days you're typically doing
it, kind of according to the instructions,
[SPEAKER_00]: or are you doing something else in regards
to the top trusting of Kraft Blend and
[SPEAKER_00]: other amendments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, I really don't have a
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one thing that drew me from
synthetic to organic was, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see Jeremy dumping the, you know,
whatever he's feeding it in his hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's not even measuring it, he's just
going for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of been my mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't top dress at all during my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I simply just water only for the most
part, and then re-amend, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: accordingly, watch the plant, which it
stayed green the whole time, so it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: tell me nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of just, you know, watch a
little more content videos from you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of made my own balance recipe and
re-amended that, and so far so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it was pretty hands-off,
a little bit easier than it is working
[SPEAKER_00]: with synthetics where you're mixing up
nutrients, different formula every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, it's easier to just go water
only a lot of the times here with the
[SPEAKER_00]: through organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like that's what you did for
your last grow and this grow.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when I ran the Chillout OG in
seven gallons, it was just Build-A-Sora
[SPEAKER_01]: 3.0, and I watered only and, you know,
added some things on the week ends and
[SPEAKER_01]: they flourished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very excited to see them in the
three-by-three bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, these soil mixes that are out there
that are water only just makes it so much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's back up to water, water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked a little bit about how important
it is, how, you know, a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say neglect, but they just
don't pay attention to as much as really
[SPEAKER_00]: they should.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using for a water source?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap water, well water, are you filtering
your water, reverse osmosis?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your water source?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for my first grow in the big beds,
I would just water out of, I had,
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran a hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, I have a wash tub down in my
basement, which is game changer to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to wash stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I ran my hose over to my grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got just a spigot and I'd fill my
buckets up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two five gallon buckets and I let
them sit over 24 hours just to
[SPEAKER_01]: dechlorinate and you see if I could rid of
anything over that small pile of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: I really didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just guessing and I'd water the
plants and it crushed, but that recipe is
[SPEAKER_01]: so solid that I think I could have thrown
anything at it and it would have been fine
[SPEAKER_01]: for the time being.
[SPEAKER_01]: A long duration, maybe not so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I finally broke down and I got a,
just an RV filter, something I think they
[SPEAKER_01]: siphon out of when they pull it out of the
lake or what have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how they do it, but it's just
a filter that I plug into my hose and it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes the small materials out that I don't
want maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a water test is definitely
going to be the way to go just to reassure
[SPEAKER_01]: what I got is going on is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even use my tap water here because
too much sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium bicarbonates comes in a very high
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not good for plants at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried using it before, but
unfortunately what it leads to is
[SPEAKER_00]: deficient plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have too much sodium in the
medium, causes lockouts of other nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: being uptaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use the reverse osmosis and I've been
using that and I know some people hate the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that reverse osmosis is used because
of the water waste, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these systems are a three to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically for every gallon you're wasting
three gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's not every single system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people know this,
but I actually just recently upgraded my
[SPEAKER_00]: RO system to the, and I pulled it up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's APEC ROES-100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the essence series and it's a one to
one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's for every gallon of water,
you're only wasting a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technology is getting better when it comes
to filtering or reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to start with clean water
really, because you can run into issues
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran into issues in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use well water, which you
know, if you get a test on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the well water comes in high iron,
but it really depends on where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, there's so many different
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could come out with different things
in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to give blanket answers whether
or not some of these water sources can be
[SPEAKER_00]: used or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with tap, you know,
whether or not you can use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, I'm rambling on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a good topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water can change everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of relating to this is the moisture
content in the medium, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So using your water, you're watering your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you monitor the moisture content?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the EcoWit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an EcoWit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't start that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of just did the whole bill of soil
method, slapped the bed and see if there's
[SPEAKER_01]: weight down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of maybe move my cover crop a little
bit and see if there's moisture on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then, like I said, I traveled so much
for work and I wasn't about to ask the
[SPEAKER_01]: wife to take care of the three kids and go
down here and do these steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I saw the EcoWit and I went ahead and
bought them for all my beds just for a
[SPEAKER_01]: reinsurance and makes my practicing
better, you know, because then I can use
[SPEAKER_01]: my gut and not rely on that so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, maybe my gut was right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really is a game changer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it just goes to show that the
technology is so advanced now that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even have to be home and you can
grow plants as long as you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a partner or somebody that can
help you along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you hand watering or you do have
an auto watering system going or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm kind of doing both right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the blue mat when I was running
synthetic and I don't think I had dialed
[SPEAKER_01]: in properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of the plants went good.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other three didn't go so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went so good and I'm pretty sure it
was a moisture reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I got a bubble in the sensor,
the carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now with the bigger beds, which I
thought about going blue soak,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're just watered in hand with a
Chapin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I water those in and the 30 gallon that I
have in the three by three tank,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a blue mat for the, and I've got it
set up properly because she's healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reservoir is going down and it's been
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of been experimenting with the
blue mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I kind of know more about what
I'm doing and what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the EcoWit came in handy
too, because that first watering can be
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have that moisture right,
you're setting yourself up for failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that was a long way with me,
you know, being newer to growing that
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me to have that little cheat to get
the moisture right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then realize, okay, this is what it
should feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when I should probably water at
this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the blue mat is definitely handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I think eventually I'll
try to get a blue soak on the beds just
[SPEAKER_01]: because I travel so much and take a little
more off the wife and maybe water some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things so much easier as far as
dialing in that moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't even need a moisture
meter if you have a blue mat system,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as you have that guess to begin
that you think the moisture level is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, if it's too moist and you
add in that blue mat could lead to
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering symptoms and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you add in that blue mat system,
at the perfect moisture level,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just maintains it and it makes things
so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I love blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak about them too much actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are there for the little
technology that's involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, it's there's no plugging
nothing in and it is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get some of them caps because I
now with the cover crop and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: growing up, it's I didn't see nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go in there to kind of maybe
chop and drop, I'm worried I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: hit that little nozzle and you know,
mess up my settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm definitely going to get one of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people use those when
they're growing with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do compost teas at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how do you use them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very rarely do do them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I when you guys came out with your
stash blend and you you know, we're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of advocate that you know, this would be a
good tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started doing that and that's all I
really did was some molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran your stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while, maybe some craft
blend and some worm castings and I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: bubble it for 12 to 24 hours and I that
went so both ways as far as timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people went 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people said don't go past 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was kind of I didn't want to feed
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what I was doing so far so
good and I would love to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dig in more on teas and because I do think
they're beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's making things readily
available, making you know, giving the
[SPEAKER_01]: sugars to the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not necessarily, you know,
that sweet spot to where you don't just
[SPEAKER_01]: have one microbe, you know, you're
dominant taking out the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that sweet spot to where you're
getting a little bit of everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to learn more about that and
definitely get more into teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they can certainly be beneficial and
there's I agree a lot of misinformation or
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of conflicting information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say where how long you
should brew for how much aeration needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get too deep into composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost teas here, but I do have other
episodes where people dive deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas and really break it down what
they do when they're brewing teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: how they brew their teas and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you talked about sugars a little bit,
microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of break down how you're
using those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the inoculants, like I said,
I'm using the rootwise, microbe complete,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biofoss and the enzyme elixir to kind
of bring those out of dormancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's as far as inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really getting too far into the
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a lot to be learned,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my understanding of sugars is,
you know, they are essential, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not a necessity, maybe not towards the end
of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could be wrong on that, that they do
use more sugars for resin production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I wouldn't quote me on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still a rookie when it comes to you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm taking a little bit of time and try
not to overwhelm myself because organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first saw it, I was like,
there is no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way I can do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just get started and, you know,
you learn as you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so starting with the right formulas
and the right, you know, guidance to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Growitz and the Jeremy's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so it's been a big help
watching you guys because otherwise it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I was back in Indiana
trying to just learn about the stuff and I
[SPEAKER_01]: had a VPN.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so scared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one could track me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been awesome to learn from
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the sugars and microbe
inoculants, a lot of people say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, that's kind of an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a personal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't need to go out and buy
these products and add them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can totally get away with just top
dressing, craft blend, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: just a fertilizer blend that have all
natural or organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could totally just get away with that
and then water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need to do mulch layers or
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people do because it helps
with growth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulch layers, cover crops, break down what
you're doing for those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the straw mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the barley straw, the blue oyster.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off with that and then I just
went to Ace and started getting some
[SPEAKER_01]: regular straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use the 12 sieve cover crop from
Build a Soil, which that stuff's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different clovers and flax and that
stuff's gorgeous to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That picture that we had in your book and
I had some layovers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just had cover crop growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much beauty in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really do think it helps protect
that rhizosphere, the top few inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil, helps spread moisture
throughout the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cover crop is huge when it comes to
spreading the moisture because even if you
[SPEAKER_01]: give too much water, you have all those
little clovers drinking up the water to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're underwater, you can kind of
see it in your cover crop maybe before
[SPEAKER_01]: your cash crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've kind of used that as my moisture
cheater too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the top inch is nice and moist,
I'm pretty sure the below layer is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a bit advocate of mulch and straw
and whatever you can get to cover it up
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep the worms happy and let them come
up and take your nutrients and down to
[SPEAKER_01]: them and feed everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would definitely say do straw and
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are just so helpful,
particularly for me living in such a dry
[SPEAKER_00]: climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: My natural humidity, I got it right here
actually, 24%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 24% RH is what it is right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my grow room is the next room
over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always adding in humidity and being
in such a dry climate, the medium dries
[SPEAKER_00]: out very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can dry out a lot faster, particularly
if you have the lights on and the heat's
[SPEAKER_00]: up and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having cover crops using a mulch layer
helps out tremendously for somebody like
[SPEAKER_00]: me who lives in this type of climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the straw just like you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use cardboard covers, just using a piece
of the cardboard, cutting them down and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting them as a cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that acts as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really breaking down like a mulch
does, but it covers the soil, which can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly have some benefits there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the cover crops, I'm usually
using the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nitrogen fixer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually grabbing nitrogen from
the air converting into a form that's
[SPEAKER_00]: usable for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need to kill off that cover crop
in order to get those advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get those advantages once you kill
off the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to warp back to kind of getting to
water a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I forgot to ask you about is pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you monitor the pH of your water going
in or monitor the pH in your medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that the nutrients and
everything are going to decide what the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: of the soil is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think me putting water,
6.5 water is going to change my soil to
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that maybe to stay in a good
balance, maybe like a 6 to 9 or 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's about where I tried to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't even check.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got here, I did a water test on
mine and it was like 7.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was more uncomfortable, you know,
hands off just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you hear what a lot of folks that
are growing organic living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till, whatever style they're doing,
not pHing at all, not monitoring the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: just adding in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it really comes down to having
a clean water source to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of controversy on
whether or not you should pH, whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not you should monitor pH when growing
with organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really think it comes down to what's
your water source to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a clean water source to begin
and it's within the proper pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some folks that have very
high pH, 8, 9 pH, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are adjusting it just to kind of
have that ease of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not saying that you can't get away
with just adding that in because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: does release acids, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To lower the pH, to make nutrients
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes are creating acids that the pH is
being adjusted by the microbes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things are happening within the medium
that's adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just the water source going in
that's determining what your pH in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I always like to ask the pH
question for the folks that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: and living soil to see like whether or not
they do just the pH because it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: split, split between people, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think with me leaning on,
you know, having a soil test every once in
[SPEAKER_01]: a while, I think it's going to help me to
kind of figure out, okay, maybe it ain't
[SPEAKER_01]: the best pH, but it's not affecting
anything within the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about EC or some people go by PPM
instead in order to get an idea of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition that's in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any sort of EC PPM tests
where there'd be a slurry test or a runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: test in order to kind of get an idea of
how much nutrition's in the medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of hands off when it comes to
PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did the synthetic for a little bit,
I would test runoff and I just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was mind boggling the invalid results
you'd get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just didn't know what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with organics, we don't want it to run
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't really have any water to test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the slurry test, I'm kind of
going towards no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being a less divisive is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of organic growers do the same thing
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into environment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dive deeper into temperature,
humidity, VPD, CO2, all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for,
for temperature for the different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the seedling stage, I like to stay in
the 76 to 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a basement, so it's kind of hard to
get the warmer temperatures without
[SPEAKER_01]: sucking your humidity out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find a good balance about 70 to 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 75 to 80, and I pretty much ride that
same temperature throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards flower, the end of flower,
I'll kind of try to stay towards that 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes 74, 73 is what I get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't noticed any less growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the terpenes have a lot to do
with temperature that we're starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: realize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like the lower temperature is
helping me out as far as keeping some
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than flower, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 75 to 80 all the way till the finish of
the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for for the
different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of ride 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go a little higher when they're
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I see 75, 80, obviously that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to try to fight that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to vegging, I'm about
65, 70%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ride that until week three of
flower, and then I'll do a 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a 5% decrease as the weeks go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I usually typically stay about 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: With me being in the basement,
you kind of tackle your weakest link.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it was kind of just,
OK, don't mess with this too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just ride this 50%, maybe have some
extra fans going in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't had any bad luck with
botrytis or mold yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to stick at the 50% if I
could.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I felt like there wasn't as much
drooping for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's 50% the lowest you go in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know a lot of people are against
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm asking for problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I probably am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, being in the basement,
it's hard for me to get that 45% without
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrificing something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the airflow, I got intake,
outtakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got two fans going, one in the middle of
the canopy, one on top of the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the VPD chart memorized in
regards to the dark green range versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: light green range versus the yellow range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the numbers you mentioned there seems
like they would be either in the dark
[SPEAKER_00]: green range or light green range for VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you monitoring VPD at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I kind of base my
temperatures and humidity on, is just to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep that VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm in seedling, 0.7, 0.8,
I'm OK with, maybe a little lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm shooting for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll ride that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way to the end of veg and get to
beginning of flower, maybe 1.2 VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do try to stay in those parameters
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the pulse chart that you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much what I've used most of
the time, is kind of stay in those
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every once in a while, I think I creep up
to 1.6, 1.7, which is a little too dry for
[SPEAKER_01]: my liking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's in the yellow range or
something around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at the pulse monitor VPD
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it says for 79 degrees,
the dark green range is between 50 and 56.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right in the ballpark as far as
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of people, when it comes
to lights off, some people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD doesn't really matter during lights
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people say, it does matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You absolutely want to still monitor that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have humidity spikes during lights
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happens to me all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being able to lower that RH,
because your temperature is dropping,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're at a 70 degree, according to
this chart, 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is calling the dark green range
from 34 to 44 percent RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's looking for a lot lower of an RH
when you have that temperature drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So VPD chart is definitely something
that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people just ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can say, hey, the plants are going to
go fine outside of the VPD range,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll definitely be able to get to a
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're looking to optimize growth,
keep plants healthy, trying to stay within
[SPEAKER_00]: these ranges on the VPD chart is wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's what's your spikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the same thing in my tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where the AC infinity
controls just change everything because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have your fan up to 10 if you need
to when they're off and maybe suck some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that humidity out and have that all on a
timer to where it's just all hands off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make it easier to control
spikes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you supplementing CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did an exhale bag one time and I just
didn't really see any huge benefits where
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to, you know, explain to
myself I'm going to buy this every grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I've seen in your videos,
you know, I got five cats, three kids and
[SPEAKER_01]: a wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always down here running around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always find one cat in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So someone's breathing and I have a CO2
meter that I have hanging in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about 350, 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I get down here,
you know, there's a lot of people home,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they'll get up to six,
700, 800, which is mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I'm supplementing is
just our own, you know, exhales and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried the exhale bags before and I
have a CO2 monitor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to kind of see, and it wasn't
very consistent, you know, it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they go in there, it'd be seven,
eight, 900, sometimes actually reaching a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, this is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, uh, other times I'd go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it would just be five, 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's very inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped using the exhale bags as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same things with the, um, TB natural
canisters, same exact thing, kind of just
[SPEAKER_00]: the inconsistency and the fact that you've
got to, you're supposed to buy a new
[SPEAKER_00]: refill packet every two weeks,
which can become costly over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stopped using those ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, uh, let's get into IPM next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So integrated pest management things to do
in order to prevent pest from invading
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your IPM routine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I try to focus on cycling three
different, um, ways of going about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the essential oils, um, which I've
kind of had a bad effect on them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it may have been my own doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I foiler sprayed when I should have waited
a little bit for the lights to go off and
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some burning, but that was my own
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the essential oils, the EM five from
build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I just got a new one from Petra
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The crop defender, which I think it's got
peppermint oil and an organic emulsifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure of all the, um, specifics,
but there's only three or four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients in there and they're all
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just implemented that into my
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got my first pest ever was,
I believe it was a clover might,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a little round orange red looking bug
and they started actually making their way
[SPEAKER_01]: up my stocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pan it cause I was on the road and I
came home and I saw this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I hit it with the EM five and the
crop defender and two weeks went by and
[SPEAKER_01]: they went away and then all of a sudden
they came back and I hit them with another
[SPEAKER_01]: dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just goes to show, I got to stay
up on IPM because if you wait for
[SPEAKER_01]: something to happen, it's too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily they didn't make it to the canopy
and they were eradicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use some ground mustard seed,
which I think helps, um, as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil keeping them underneath there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I try to implement the three
rotation of three and I may switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used Neem before.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first got the beds and trying to
find out the watering, I was overwatering
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a lot of gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had the traps and you know,
finally they did eradicate and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the beds were able to balance themselves
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you what pests you've
kind of come across and how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: resolved them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just answered that right there for
the gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it just, just the Neem and the
traps or, or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I use the Neem and the essential oils
and the EM five actually all in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I just went for it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, cause it was bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd open up the tent and they were
flying in front of your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't just one or two here or there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I panicked cause I go, I just got this
balanced soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I doing wrong here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which, you know, Jeremy says that,
you know, starting a new bed, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to have gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, there's compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, more moisture than,
you know, your regular size bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, but once I sprayed those on
there, they went away and it kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced themselves out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume that you were in the
vegetation stage when you were battling
[SPEAKER_00]: that or were you spraying that stuff while
in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily I'm a long veg or two kind of just
waiting to see for something to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I eradicated it luckily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did notice one or two after the
fact, looking through my jewelry loop for,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, on the trichomes, there was a gnat or
two in there, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not the end of the world,
especially being the home growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in a big facility maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, it wasn't really too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like bugs and dirt and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often are you actually getting in
there and kind of inspecting your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and looking for pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately I only can get in
there on the weekends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the occasion I will be home during the
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do try to dedicate a lot of time
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wake up super early in the morning,
kind of get in, get it out of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I could do a better job, um,
watching for issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like last time it kind of, they got up
the stock when maybe I could have
[SPEAKER_01]: eradicated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I do need to do a better job of
overseeing my canopies and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: finally looking through there and making
sure everything's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you mentioned, it can get out
of control quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, you meant you were,
when you're talking about the fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_00]: and how out of control it got,
I thought about a time where it got out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not on top of it, it gets out of
control and then you get frustrated and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you start getting worried that the
plant's not going to get to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, being on top of it, scouting,
I typically don't go in there every couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of days and I am a scouting looking for
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have the yellow stickies there to
make sure just really as an identifier,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to illuminate the
population, just having yellow stickies in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but at least you're able to see if
they're there and then take action from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything else that you feel
like we need to know or the audience needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to know about keeping plants healthy when
growing with organic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just trust your gut and stay balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to organics, you,
you don't want to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the soil is going to take care of
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, especially if, like I said,
if you started balanced and you're staying
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of watering, moisture and making
sure everything's in the right place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, um, you're crushing organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, like I said, I travel all the time for
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hardly home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you follow me on Instagram,
you see the plants and it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got the right equipment and the
right mentors, like Mr. Grote himself,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can crush too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned in the beginning of the
episode, I'm looking at your Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just, you're crushing it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew you grew a lot of the Chilodo G's.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those have you grown out so
far?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this will be eight or nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I kind of did a little phenol
picking right off the rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just how they were growing structure
wise and writing off the males,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was the hardest thing I've ever
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had, I've always been a
feminized grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I, you know, ran yours like,
ah, man, I cannot kill this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I just don't have the room or the time
right now to go down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's been a great plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: My everybody loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been, it's been an honor to
work with you and talk with you and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get your feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that helps me in my garden,
make, you know, I'm doing things okay for
[SPEAKER_01]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a fantastic job, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, the pictures you submit are just
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the frost that you're able to pick
up in these pictures, the stacking on the
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes and just, when I got to give my wife
credit some too, she is the photographer
[SPEAKER_01]: during the week.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll send me pictures and then I'll turn
them into something on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's an amazing photographer too.
[SPEAKER_01]: She knows what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's, she's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they came out awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I look forward to
continuing to watch it grows on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link to your Instagram down in
the YouTube description section below,
[SPEAKER_00]: but tell the audience other ways they can
find you besides Instagram, if any.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, um, I pretty much have the
McCannabis Luke social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my partner, Canada, Matt Creations,
and I started a business with my dad
[SPEAKER_01]: called soil plus edu.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find us on Instagram as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as far as things coming up,
we got the growers gauntlet, which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty excited for team grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'm actually joining my first,
um, competition here in Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Michigan gems and genetics cup,
and I will be entering the Branson's royal
[SPEAKER_01]: revenge into that, which is, I think the
turning dates, four 20, which it worked
[SPEAKER_01]: out perfect because the crop out and the
time and the cure, you know, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have something that's been sitting
on the shelves and go enter into a
[SPEAKER_01]: competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the timing was perfect and I'm anxious,
but it's excited to just be a part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: community and kind of meet new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, supposed to be meeting madman
plant in a Nikon over in Chicago sometime
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to get out and maybe run
into you.
[SPEAKER_01]: To show and you know, work together and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been exciting, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck on submit your submission,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, uh, hopefully you win that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, grows gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that, which is, uh,
might as well talk about that for a second
[SPEAKER_00]: is really it's an event where you enter
in, you join a team and then you submit
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures on your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a winner is picked in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the winner is picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the winner actually gets a trip
to humble to actually be with the humbled
[SPEAKER_00]: crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, they actually tour their outdoor
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are tuned into this,
I want to join the grows gauntlet you have
[SPEAKER_00]: until April 20th in order to officially
join, just go to growers gauntlet.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll basically join the
discord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's all the information that you
need about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and join my team, team grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, lots of different things you need
to do in order to keep plants healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the grow when organic
gardening, I mean, we covered nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a lot of other things we
can get into, you know, lighting and the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there's a part two that comes up
in the future between us, the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did we forget?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to know what other things we should
talk about and expand upon when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to using organic inputs and keeping plants
healthy throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot more to the
conversation than what we just had here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love to, read about it here in the
comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, Luke, thanks so much for coming
on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love these chill conversations,
just talking shop and just seeing how you
[SPEAKER_00]: do things and keeping plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's valuable for the audience
to hear about some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a blast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
Thanks for watching.
See you next time.
