[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll watch a Max's channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another PAR test video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the year old 170 watt LED grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over this grow light in order
to do a PAR test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not only going to do a PAR test in
this video, but I'm also going to unbox
[SPEAKER_00]: the unit and I'm going to test the heat
output on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the
features that this grow light has,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will leave a link to this grow light
in the description section below so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first thing out the box is the
driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light does require assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, some of you may call this
a DIY grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing out the box is the power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, there is an instruction
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've included a Phillips head
screwdriver, one rope ratchet hanger,
[SPEAKER_00]: one wire hanging kit, a bag of screws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the side piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are actually two of them in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly is the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I mentioned, this light does
require assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the side pieces and screwing
them into the side of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The screwdriver works okay, but I went
ahead and busted out my screw gun to make
[SPEAKER_00]: things a bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I connect the driver to the
LED boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then connect the driver to the power
cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the driver just rests freely on
the top of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to use two rope ratchet
hangers to hang my grow lights because it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it a lot easier to hang and not have
to worry about the light spinning or being
[SPEAKER_00]: not level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here I'm using the Happy Hydro rope
ratchets.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an extended range PFD sensor,
which measures from 340 nanometers to 1040
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time watching my PAR
test videos, I take the measurements the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way every video and I go by the light
distance recommended by the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents,
which have reflective walls so that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering coverage area for this LED
grow light is two foot by two foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm taking measurements in a two foot
by four foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to keep my meter in a two
foot by two foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the grow light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 1.33 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 158 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below so you can learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
See you next time.
