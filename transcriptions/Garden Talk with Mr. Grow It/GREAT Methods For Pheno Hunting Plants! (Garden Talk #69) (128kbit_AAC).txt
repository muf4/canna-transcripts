[SPEAKER_02]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest variable for me that I've
noticed is the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics, genetics, genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the phenotype within the genetic has
been a big focus for me for the past like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you end up getting a bunch of
variations that are keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was over at a buddy's house today
and he had so many that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically different enough that they
should almost have different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you label properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be so bummed out when you're like,
oh man, I didn't label this phenyl right
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be this or it's this and it takes
three more cycles to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see somebody who's just knocking
out of the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to realize they got a very good
phenotype, potentially good cut or they've
[SPEAKER_01]: hunted the right one or they just got
lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But finding the right characteristic
expression within that particular genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is huge for any grower to get the
best results.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_02]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode number 69.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, I interview Rob from
CLTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is back for a second time on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This time around, he's going to get deep
into the process of phenyl hunting plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: something he has a ton of experience
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by

[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_02]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: A big supporter of this podcast is AC
Infinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sponsor this podcast and I use their

[SPEAKER_02]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I am joined with Rob from CLTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to be back on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I don't see enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy you brought me over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say you're no stranger to
Garden Talk podcast, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You are on episode number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The very first episode of this podcast was
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we talked all about fertilizing
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one actually has over 261,000 views.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like the second most viewed on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course it's on all podcast
platforms as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a ridiculous amount of people tuned
into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a ridiculous amount of
people that had real positive things to
[SPEAKER_02]: say about you, about that discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people want you back for a part two.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for coming back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, my lips dried out with all that love
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate that, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool, especially to see a
conversation like that that gets to the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitty gritty of basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you built so much more on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It went to next level science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool to see the inception
to where it is now.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're going to get deep into
pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that you have several
experience with and you're very passionate
[SPEAKER_02]: about it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, can you introduce yourself to
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_02]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, I'm Rob from CLTV from
the Stash, Top Buds, Rob Vlogs,
[SPEAKER_01]: three different channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a grower now for about 14 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical program here, as long as it's been
available since 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll just say I've been growing
legally for 14 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely have some experience with other
plants, but my main favorite is our
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite herb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And overall, since making content,
I feel like teaching people, I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've changed, I've pivoted, I've grown
with synthetics, organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest variable for me that I've
noticed is the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Genetics, genetics, genetics, but the
phenotype within the genetic has been a
[SPEAKER_01]: big focus for me for the past like maybe
five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I really got away from the pick and
mix and focused a little bit more on
[SPEAKER_01]: finding the variety within the single
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genetics are just so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's like the emphasis on it
sometimes I don't think is enough between
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly new growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they don't understand the importance
of genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can have a dialed environment,
lighting, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrition can be dialed in, but if you
have bad genetics, I mean, it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not going to come out anywhere near
it would as if you had good genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, phenotypes, genotypes,
let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's dial it back for beginners though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is pheno hunting and why do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a lot of debate,
kind of the bro science side of pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: People argue pheno or geno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a thing, but pheno hunting
I feel is more of course finding the
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristic expression within the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the analogy of, let's say you
have the same parents and you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: brothers and sisters, but you all are a
little unique, but you all maybe have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same gap like myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, if you're just
listening or you all have a hair color
[SPEAKER_01]: that everybody's got red hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a genetic trait that's carried
through, but there's still individuality
[SPEAKER_01]: between each sibling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's comparable when you see a
cultivar, it's going to be similar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then plus the genetic expression
within your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking for the right cultivar,
when you say you want to get a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic, it may not even be that same
genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, for example, had a, I think it was
agent orange, orange something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what it was, but there
was one cultivar, one version of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially one phenotype that was very
Java coffee like, and one that was very
[SPEAKER_01]: citrus and orange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I unfortunately was in the pick and mix
phase of not knowing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different genetic expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the Java one and was like,
this is bunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, wow, it was not the right
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really, you know, it took me
about nine years before I started really
[SPEAKER_01]: realizing I'm like, man, I'm comparing
apples to oranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to speak, I'm comparing my buddies,
totally different cultivar, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the same, but it's different,
different characteristic expressions that
[SPEAKER_01]: came from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I really dove into the
pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that when you're looking for
genetics, you're not looking for just
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for a particular phenotype
within that genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's changed my whole approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of people, when they
look at one of their buddy grows,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll see somebody who's just knocking
out of the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to realize they got a very good
phenotype, potentially good cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they've hunted the right one,
or they just got lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens sometimes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But finding the right characteristic
expression within that particular genetic,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is huge for any grower to get the
best results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each seed is its own phenotype,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were to grow one plant and then
take clones of that plant, that's still
[SPEAKER_02]: the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a couple of things to mention
there for those that don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there can be so much variability
depending on the genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on what generation it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it inbreeding that's done?
[SPEAKER_02]: How far down has it gone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we're getting to breeding a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to really touch on that
topic deeply.
[SPEAKER_02]: But genetics, there's variations that
happen with characters, looks like you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the environment definitely comes into
play heavily when it comes to different
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypes and how they express
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you phenohunt males plants,
female plants, or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently just female because I'm not
doing any breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the capacity, probably even
mental capacity, to do any breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not on Dr. Growitt's level in terms of
even being a hobbyist and giving it a
[SPEAKER_01]: shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly because right now I like to just
find different flower that I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I can find that with breeding,
there's some amazing breeders out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm going to let them do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe one day when I've got this
space, I'll throw my hat in the ring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for now, I like what I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking for females usually only.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so females only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're starting from seed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how many seeds are you planting
for your phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was doing a decent amount
until we had Matt Mooney on From the
[SPEAKER_01]: Stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's talking about doing 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, I'm going to do a little
bit, probably 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm doing 10 on average is normally
what I've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most I've done is 20 at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, it was because I heard
that there was a lot of different
[SPEAKER_01]: variations of the same cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for one in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll cut the rest off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like getting a pack of baseball cards
or Pokemon cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking for a particular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of get duds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you end up getting a bunch of
variations that are keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was over at a buddy's house today
and he had so many that they were
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically different enough that they
should almost have different names.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not even in the same family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the type that I'm concerned
about when you recommend it to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: because they may not get that same
phenotype issue, which is where the
[SPEAKER_01]: argument of cuts, like we talked on from
the stash again, referring back of where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't secure that exact phenotype
unless you go about that process
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a major hunt, find a bunch and
then keep that secured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you have to find that cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as easy as some would think.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be really nice if we could plant 100
seeds, like you mentioned, and hunt to
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality of it, a lot of folks are
home growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a plant count.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure you have a plant count as well in
your state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a maximum number that we are
allowed to grow legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So staying with that, that's certainly
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can still have a phenol hunt
within the matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do like five plants,
10 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do a low number.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to be 100 plants in order
to do a true phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned, you might not find
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might plant 10, 15 seeds,
whatever, and then none of them are
[SPEAKER_02]: actually what you're looking for in that
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you start over.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kill off those plants or consume those
plants, whatever, and then you just plant
[SPEAKER_02]: new seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And continue your hunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing that right now with the cell at
OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending, luckily, I know the guy who
having to breed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worst case condition, if I don't find
the one I'm after, growth wise,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both look like twins, but one is
hungrier than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them is noticeably more tracked
out than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But who knows at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's hard because when you're limited
on the phenotypes you have, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: literally kind of stuck between the two
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's cool at some points, but when
they're so similar, that's where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, where do you decide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones do you keep?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a good sign, but I do sometimes
like those genetic variations where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have one that leans this way, more sour,
more funky, and another one that may be
[SPEAKER_01]: more deep gas or more sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way you've got a little bit of
variety, but also grow very comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way your canopy could be even and
you do it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see gorilla butter, they've got white
truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people just know it as that genetic,
but it's actually a named phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla glue number four, that number four
is a number four for a reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: The phenotype is usually the number is
what people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays to identify these particular
characteristics, I personally think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: okay to rename a cut as long as you give
respect and you mention that this is a cut
[SPEAKER_01]: of this particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's getting to the point now where
the phenotypes are the more focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: What pheno did this person have?
[SPEAKER_01]: What pheno is at that dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: What pheno did they secure?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just getting seeds, you don't
really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just saying, I got these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see if I get it in this pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you're starting your pheno hunt,
what medium are you using to begin?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, I guess, container size,
container type.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first get started, I'm usually
using like a solo cup to get started with
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually nine times out of 10 using
Royal Gold's Tupper, but they run out
[SPEAKER_01]: often where I'm at locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use an alternative as close as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use maybe Cocoa Loco and cut it with
a little bit of base regular cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anything, add a little perlite for
some aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I start really like low on my
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: If any food at all to begin for nutrients,
whether that be organic side or mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: base is a low dose to get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way I can get the stronger growing
obviously seed, but not overpower and kill
[SPEAKER_01]: it and burn it when it's young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, I want to get the most
natural best characteristics and
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions from the genetics so I know
which one I want to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I'll move up to a larger pot,
usually either one gallon or a three to
[SPEAKER_01]: five.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm using a cloth pot, sometimes I'll
just go right into a five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess more for a mess, not necessarily
anything behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like making a big mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just plain water with light
nutrients, usually low on like 150,
[SPEAKER_01]: 200 PPM, very, very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using synthetic bottled nutrients or
are you talking organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, for synthetic bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you pulling that one out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's interesting that you mentioned cocoa
as your medium, because there are so many
[SPEAKER_02]: variables that can happen just within like
the soil, for example, or within the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're starting with cocoa,
starting with an inert medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything against starting in
soil like that's pre-charged with
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that kind of, I mean, there's so many
variables.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally feel like if you're starting
in a soil that's already pre-charged with
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients, you really don't know what's in
that mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not every single one of those mixes can
kind of be the same for each container,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're in cocoa, you're starting
with an inert medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're mixing up your nutrients at the
same PPM and you're distributing them all
[SPEAKER_02]: to the individual plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like more dialed in as far
as feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on phenol hunting
in soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it certainly can still be done
within soil, but what are your thoughts
[SPEAKER_02]: overall on that avenue?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's a very, very valid question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you're looking to scale or if
you're in a caregiver operation or looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to go craft or commercial, that should be
a big focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get the best expression,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you already have an established
garden, you want to integrate what works
[SPEAKER_01]: for your established garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think changing everything to fit
one cultivar would make sense unless this
[SPEAKER_01]: is the one that you need for medicine and
it's going to change your life or your
[SPEAKER_01]: family's life, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, like if let's say you are a
firm believer using, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: build a soil and you're running that and
you don't want to change because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, well, I've been using this mix
forever, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then make sure it works with what you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that genetic doesn't, that phenotype
doesn't, well, then it's telling you it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not meant to be in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my belief, at least personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're looking to take this as a
business or profession or a real serious
[SPEAKER_01]: hobby, then maybe you do want to start
totally clean and get the best version of
[SPEAKER_01]: that particular cultivar, the particular
phenotype of the cultivar, doing it that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really think about it in that way,
but that's a great point that you made
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got your plants growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And during a phenol hunt, the plants are
going to start to show different
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many different characteristics
that you can look for when phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What characteristics do you look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good question as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only recently have I really,
really focused on leaf-to-bud ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't a big thing for me before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stacking of the nodes, how tight the
nodes are in the leaf-to-bud ratio,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm a solo trimmer 90% of the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big shout out AC Infinity because I
got the Trimble from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I've had some
cultivars that I let go in the past couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of years, 11 roses being one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I hated trimming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like my first factor is like,
is this a squatty, leafy mess that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a lot of work to train it,
let alone finish it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like number one, as I'm looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that speed of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it depends because, for example,
Chillado G was slower grower for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was big, wide, but not tall in length.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pinky like my others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the stacking of the nodes,
I was like, whew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this growth here, I could have these
big, tall Amazon women here that have
[SPEAKER_01]: stretchy nodes or I have these shorter
ones that are compact with not crazy
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's another check in the book where
I'm like, man, that leaf-to-bud with the
[SPEAKER_01]: node stacking really makes a big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of trumps the speed of growth for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, I'm going to potentially
get more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's in flower, it's in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really focus a whole lot on like
the leaf size or anything in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do look a little bit on some
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice we'll get those natural purple
stems, like just reddish kind of purple
[SPEAKER_01]: stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do try to avoid those ones when I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like they want more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little finicky, but some
cultivars lately, especially, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: noticing that they purple up as a plant
and that's kind of like in the genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: makeup of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look at something that doesn't show
me the tendencies of stress early on,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not going to show me that
it may need more down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's going to fit within my cycle
because I don't want to have, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic, I don't want to have multiple
different containers or reservoirs with
[SPEAKER_01]: different amounts of nutrients for a
couple of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: If half my room's something and the other
half is that, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, like if you're not working
in my mix already, you gots to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to, that'll again kind of
push everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, I really have to work hard
to make you last.
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus, I mean, you got to put in work,
but if I'm already putting work over here
[SPEAKER_01]: on what's already established and what I
like, I'm not going to throw the risk over
[SPEAKER_01]: here with this phenohunt to take something
in that's going to mess up my whole cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we're in the flower,
of course, I'm looking at trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at, I wouldn't say I'm huge on
bud structure per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want foxtail-y stuff, but I do
like some stuff that's got some density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like super airy, you know,
fluffy, sativa-like, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of plant growth structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to find something that fits
and has that tightness to it, but also has
[SPEAKER_01]: the trichomes to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Color's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: At all for me personally, purple is just
purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get that, it's a nice perk to
be like, wow, look at this exotic stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: here, changed the game, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the number one factor for me,
number, number one, is those terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terps with flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavonoids you'll find out later,
but the terps, if I'm smelling that and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't smell anything, or if it smells like
something I don't like at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like I'm getting rid of these clones
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even want to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not even going to keep her around
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so you named off a large handful of
things that relate to the morphology of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant, and also the chemo type as well
you talked about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now how about, do you look at when the
plant starts to flower at all,
[SPEAKER_02]: or the total flowering time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that matter to you at all,
or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Total flowering time is one for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only recently, again, I find that out with
the GMO, where I was like, I could wait 13
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst case, I pull these others.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two are still in here for a little
while, and I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you grow them like your others,
they're huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take up space, and your canopy is
wonky and weird because of that setup,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on your setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a four by four, it might be
the whole tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got a larger space or an open
space, it's throwing everything off,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I can't stand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't stand something that's going to be
a staggered cultivar that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily give me the results I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I know it's going to be a long one,
it usually doesn't even make it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was just sheer ignorance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me not looking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I don't necessarily focus too
heavy on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess in the same side, like a late
bloomer, so to speak, something that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't get going quicker, that also is an
issue for me too sometimes because right
[SPEAKER_01]: now I'm dealing with the white truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to grow that all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it just seems like my canopy
fills out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stretches longer than the others do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps that stretch going versus the
others start flowering quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, man, I've got a canopy that
slides down like a mountain, and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to put it up on crates or something
to make it real even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're using trellising or
anything for stability, that could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: real headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I do look at both factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just not as crucial other than the
time of how long it takes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing 13 weeks anymore ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going back to the smell,
one of the common techniques that people
[SPEAKER_02]: use when they're phenohunting is the stem
rub technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll take their fingers and they'll
basically rub the stem and then they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: smell their fingers and see if it's what
they like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do that technique at all or are you
doing something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have in the past, and usually
if it's got a sharp smell, then usually
[SPEAKER_01]: there's sharp terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the distinctiveness of that terpene I
don't get from the stem rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get either if anything, like a lime with
chlorophyll, cucumber-y kind of smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's sharp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells like flour, you know,
but not like the gas or like the berry or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the actual flower really gives.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I smell one, then it smells like
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, you know, I literally don't smell
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be different for me
because I just right off the bat,
[SPEAKER_01]: my assumptions could be placebo.
[SPEAKER_01]: My assumption is the flower is going to be
the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I, it just drops down in my book.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm like in my phone, I'll usually
document everything in Google keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have Evernote that I'll use for
like just backing up the specific details.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't always have to add a lot of stuff,
but if there's something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be like, this one smells like
cardboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is drywall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another common thing that people
do is they'll deliberately stress their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants at certain times throughout their
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they do it for various reasons,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do a stress for feeding
purposes to see how well it handles
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: They could do stress or try to bring on
more trichome development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing any type of precision stress
throughout the grow at all while you're
[SPEAKER_02]: phenol hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first run, and I feel like you'll
probably ask me about this at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first run when I'm doing a phenol hunt,
I don't do a whole lot to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll, barely even low stress
trainer top it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I want to see what it does
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a few cultivars that grow like
Christmas trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had a few that come out looking
like they've been topped, like naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: top themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, how do I have so many colas on
this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That for me shows a lot of just natural
characteristics for the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after that, I'm like, all right,
well, what can I do to manipulate this
[SPEAKER_01]: better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I do more of an aggressive high
stress training or should I do like an
[SPEAKER_01]: actual lower technique, your lower stress
technique?
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, it's usually the second
or third run before I even really start to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to manipulation in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with, with nutrient stress,
I usually never do that because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: already, I have a perpetual growth,
so I'm already running ones that I like in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to just increase heavy on
the PPM or the EC just for the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm doing a full room, like I did
recently with the, uh, the truffles,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a particular phenol I had,
but it's, do I want to keep this genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: in my garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up going higher in everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even my light was more intense just
to see how it turned out and it handled
[SPEAKER_01]: the stress pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of trichomes, the fade was insane on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looked better than any I've seen in person
personally of any of these truffles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't take the credit for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seems like that genetic can take a
little more and in its defense will
[SPEAKER_01]: express more, you know, cool color,
more trichomes, more terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: more things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't go too hard early, but I give
it some time to integrate it into my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden before I really, you know,
hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you did touch upon training a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I know some folks, what those will do
is they'll go as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: in order to test the vigor of the plant,
they'll actually snap branches to see how
[SPEAKER_02]: the branches snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do anything like that or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, but I've got a buddy who does
that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's very, very, very aggressive with the
plant to see, see if it ends up getting
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Oh, I'm trying to see if it
Hermes, which I guess I, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get where that comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause what if an accident happens once you
have this in production, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really should stress test it just like
anything that goes to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets a stress test.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give it the most perfect
environment, it's like, yeah, of course it
[SPEAKER_01]: does good, but you know, move it to
somewhere more difficult and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to perform the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So giving a good stress test could help me
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't go that hard with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to break them.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal at the end is to have a decent
amount of high quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm delaying the flowering period
or the vegging period by doing some stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, it's not beneficial to me
personally, unless I have a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, clones from that particular
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's usually the second run where
I'll get a little more wild second or
[SPEAKER_01]: third.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, Oh, let's see what this
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if I top this or bend this down
or just crack this over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, put a little tape around it,
see if it recovers, you know, and it it's
[SPEAKER_01]: good to find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then at that point, I've already kind
of decided what I've liked in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then it's like, is this that much
better of a grower that I can sacrifice a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of the terpenes and a little
bit of the end result product for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the mentality for me,
isn't the same as for someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for production for, you know,
caregiver, caregiver, side of hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we'll just say other reasons,
wink, wink, if you're not watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some people may be focused heavier on
the yield and they could sacrifice a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of the terpenes and more and
more people don't care as much about
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, which sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm realizing this people just like
myself, who will drink Corona or Bud Light
[SPEAKER_01]: or Miller Light aren't chasing after the
flavor of beer as much as we are the
[SPEAKER_01]: effective beer, as we're somebody,
you know, same with flavor for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not be looking for that crazy,
unique terpene, but they want something in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ballpark, a light undertone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody may be looking at a
characteristic or treating a certain way
[SPEAKER_01]: for different variables than myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like more and more people are
caring less about biomass and more about
[SPEAKER_02]: things like blood density, terpenes,
you know, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually doing a female hunt right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those that don't know, I have my
own cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brisker OG male.
[SPEAKER_02]: I crossed with a female of Pakistan Valley
and that's named chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gone down to generation F2 right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on that going to an F3,
but I don't do any training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do any training this run,
just letting the plants grow naturally,
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing how its natural shape occurs,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking particularly for that
branching to naturally come out versus,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I get some cultivars where you
just got that one cola coming straight up
[SPEAKER_02]: and really not much side branching,
but having that branching and having one
[SPEAKER_02]: more even structure, it's easier to train
in the future, have that even canopy,
[SPEAKER_02]: even bud structure across all the
branches, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I'm just like you where I don't
really do much training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kind of look at the plant naturally
and see how is that structure looking,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where you can really decide
if this genetic just out of the gate is a
[SPEAKER_01]: beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like, I mean, anybody can be an
athlete if you train enough and you work
[SPEAKER_01]: out enough and you take the right
supplements, maybe even steroids if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: weird like that, but whatever you want to
do, you can get to that point too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people are natural athletes where
they're just this ox and just a tank and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, man, you're a lineman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look at Trey and look at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot defend you running down the
finish line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I may push one person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trey will de-bow somebody and the Dama
Kansu style step on you walking through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that with plants too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see some big hearty monsters that
are just these next level ones that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have to do as much work to and
you're yielding like crazy and others that
[SPEAKER_01]: you really have to manipulate to get to
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really want to see the natural
characteristics I feel in a phenol hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: before you do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to go back to lighting for a few
minutes here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You touched upon it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are actually going to push
their plants with lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're measuring the PPFD,
they're measuring that PAR and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to increase it and give it the
maximum amount as possible and seeing how
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants are going to react.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people, what they're doing is
they're lowering the light level and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're kind of making sure that the plant
isn't suffering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That it's coming across without having
issues, that it's like a normal grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you could say, nothing extreme.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing any sort of light
manipulation either stressing it with more
[SPEAKER_02]: light or are you just kind of having
normal light levels or reduced light
[SPEAKER_02]: levels when you are phenol hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of like I mentioned before,
once I decide I like this flavor and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to keep it around, then maybe I'd
start doing more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing it right now with the white
truffle and that's not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a cultivar, a phenotype of the
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I get further, I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really like to just integrate it
into my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I would never go that much higher
with my light, so why do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I would never add much more
nutrients, so why do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't go and just randomly break
branches, so why do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want it to fit into my garden or else
it's not going to fit into my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: My flavor choice is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very blessed I work with companies
like Franklin Field so they can grow some
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that I may not love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love it, but I may not love to
grow and then I can grow the stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: fits for my particular garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice right now everything I have is
kind of lankier, got that sativa-like look
[SPEAKER_01]: other than the Shell at OG, which is
squatty and thick, tight colas already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far, that would have to be a solo
run.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Shell would have to be like a
monocrop, so to speak, where I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: going to run this by itself so I could
fill the room up, canopies even,
[SPEAKER_01]: train the same, done right, versus these
lanky ones that I have to really
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate and work to even fit in the
same space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cultivars don't match together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my light intensity of what I would do
to increase it is going to be when I do
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the solo run by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I've kind of run it through my
personal crop, I see how I like it,
[SPEAKER_01]: see it's doing good, move it to a four by
four, then push it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, man, can I get maybe more out of
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can this handle more?
[SPEAKER_01]: This may be that random unicorn out there
that hits all the marks, but then also can
[SPEAKER_01]: take more so I can push it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got this X3 Ultra from Chiltek and
it's like, let's see what we can do,
[SPEAKER_01]: baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what we can do, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine since you're doing different
stressors throughout multiple runs,
[SPEAKER_02]: a common technique that people do,
and I believe you do, is you take clones,
[SPEAKER_02]: at some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll grow the plants and during the
vegetation stage, I don't know how long
[SPEAKER_02]: you're vegging the plants for,
but at some point you're taking clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: then you're having those clones kind of
like on the side on standby.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're finishing up your
phenohunt and then you're, I guess you're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking those clones and then you're doing
your next run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that kind of how that's working?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next clone will be like my temporary
mother, which I usually don't keep a
[SPEAKER_01]: mother playing around for a while,
but just to secure that genetic,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have one that I'm like, well,
I'm just going to cut on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not doing nothing just to make sure
I keep you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to sacrifice it by
mislabeling something or it gets lost in
[SPEAKER_01]: the mix, not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually what I'll do is about two,
three weeks before I flip into flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my, you know, stripping on the
bottom area and I'll take most of those
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts, sometimes a couple from the tops,
but to make sure I got an adequate amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of time for recovery before I flip the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now flipping the flower isn't necessarily
being in flower, just a light cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still got that time, that little
window of vegging still, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant's really fully recovered by
the time I go back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the next run of clones is already
sitting in the cloner, you're going,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm growing them with less,
like full intention.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing the manipulation to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing some training, but knowing that,
Hey, I may not keep these four here,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending if I don't like this phenome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I literally will go in there,
call the herd.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have to, I don't want to have a room
full of stuff I don't like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got way more flower stuff I don't
like than what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently even still like don't even
want to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's to the point where.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to pick and choose when
you're in a smaller space and you're pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many clones am I going to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I may not keep all these clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done that before where I've got 10 of
each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so stupid because I only wanted
to keep one out of five of the phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have 50 when I was more,
I had more, more patients at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a big mistake because my whole
run was just stuff I didn't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just flat as it gets to eighties
booty, just nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, how I will run my stuff is three
clones of each, sometimes two,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it'll be labeled as like chill it OGA,
chill it OGB, chill it OGC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got those added into my
phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that they're within row A,
one, two, three row B, you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that it's pretty easy to know what I've
got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way, once it comes back through
the larger plants and flower, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: labeled chill it OGA, chill it OGB.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could choose the one I like and say,
I really didn't like this one over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're gone, but you too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to, we're going to run you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, I got to see which in the
battle of the bands with you and see which
[SPEAKER_01]: is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of times for me, I don't know
till the second or third run, like from
[SPEAKER_01]: going from, from directly from the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant may be hardier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the taproot and everything there,
you're, you're doing great there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then from a clone, I feel like I can
really find like, do I like this smoke?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this what I want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth is a big thing, but I'm a
connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to know after a run or two,
how it's reacting to my garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: how this next one was acclimated to my
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you really see the phenotype
expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like is when your environment gets
used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first take in a cut, it's like,
that runs pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it's good, but the next one is like,
damn, I don't know what I did,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I changed nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just been here now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just think it's getting used to my
routine and the plant is a acclimating to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long are you typically keeping your
plants in the vegetation stage when phenol
[SPEAKER_02]: hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was longer than normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I wanted to take a fair amount of
cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kept it in for about maybe nine
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ballpark normally it's six to eight weeks
at the most, like the very most,
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, the stretch that I normally
get with the other cultivars, I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything about the Chellets in
particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's what I'm doing a phenol hunt
of right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't sure how they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, are they going to be lanky?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be tall?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then how fat and squatty they were to get
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they morphed in a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, so we're just going
to see what you ladies do and get you
[SPEAKER_01]: going longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had, did a little bit of
training to two of them that were just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little lankier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, yeah, it's I see how you
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to train you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they were dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, no, no, if I was hunting for
males, they would have been prime
[SPEAKER_01]: candidates because they reeked like
outside smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I cut them down the garbage reeked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a probably a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably should have got you some pollen
there, but when you're looking for what's
[SPEAKER_01]: right for you, sometimes you got to give
it a little more time because if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to take a fair amount of cuts,
you're going to be putting a plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not at its full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's been hacked on and chopped
down and worked, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I get exactly what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got your plants growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point do you start to kill off
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you letting them grow all the way
through and killing them off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you like looking at the
characteristics during each stage of
[SPEAKER_02]: growth and then killing off plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for example, killing off plants in
the vegetation stage, then maybe you're
[SPEAKER_02]: putting them into the flower and then
evaluating what they look like and then
[SPEAKER_02]: killing off plants and flowering,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you go about like killing off
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because I'm more of a connoisseur
than like I'm a grower, but I'm a smoker
[SPEAKER_01]: more than anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm a grower because I'm such
a smoker and so picky, but I do love to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I normally don't let it go until it's
fully cured.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I won't even consider cutting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to stick around until I
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sometimes again, that second run,
I'll let it go through again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I would have done this,
maybe I let it go a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know it says, you know,
60 or 70 days, but maybe 75, maybe would
[SPEAKER_01]: have brought up something more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually will wait, you know,
I'm not going to kill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been too many times I've had my
great white buffalo, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that got away, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's depressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the sour Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll always remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, holy grail Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went through 10 packs of that one,
10 packs, never found the same phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, you can't let stuff go until
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it's man, those are bars too,
but it's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mandatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to let it go through all the way
to see, because it could change in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cure could change the game,
but if it's growing so poorly and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to ruin your production,
you may want to call her just depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I mean, there's, I know there's some
phenol hunters that they're looking for
[SPEAKER_02]: that vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they find like in the vegetation
stage that it's just a overall weak plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll kill it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I actually did a phenol hunting talk
with Northwest J on this podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was like episode number five or
episode six or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was talking about how he's never
killed off a female plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's always done the same thing you do,
which is let it grow all the way till the
[SPEAKER_02]: end, harvest, dry, cure, then consume,
and then kind of make his decision there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's a couple different ways to
go about it for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, depends on who you are and kind of
what you're looking for within the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: on whether or not you're going to kill off
plants at all, or if you're just going to
[SPEAKER_02]: let them kind of grow through my next
question, which you kind of already
[SPEAKER_02]: touched on a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you select just one phenol?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a keeper or multiple phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you kind of already mentioned that,
you know, you go through the first run,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll have multiple keepers.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll put them through a next run as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going through these multiple
rounds?
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point do you know that this is the
one all other phenos that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: working with are going to get killed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only been more recently with the new
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the last time I remember the last
genetics that I popped that there was a
[SPEAKER_01]: clear winner and clear not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's TJ sub cool where I was like,
I mean, they were all good, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, this is obviously the one they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the vortex.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good as we're now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the stability of a lot of the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always a bad thing, but it's
like, there's so many variations that I
[SPEAKER_01]: find within these where I'm like,
man, that's so different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's nothing like this yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant looks the same, but the flavor
isn't even in the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is gassy funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is total lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how did they come in the same pack?
[SPEAKER_01]: But they look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point it's like, yeah,
I'm keeping them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's like, well, this one's just as
a mild version of this, like a headbanger
[SPEAKER_01]: is a prime example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headbanger was either kind of flat,
heavier yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it, it looked the same, but it
yielded way better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the smell was just really mild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the flavonoids and the other,
which was smaller yielder looked
[SPEAKER_01]: comparable in the structure, but fire
terps just, so it was like, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: dead ass obvious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one am I going to keep as the
connoisseur?
[SPEAKER_01]: The one that is potent as can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my keeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it does depend on the genetics
you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: These newer age ones that don't have the
right cross or don't have the right
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find a few, you may find like
five, six, you know, some of the older
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that have been tested and been around
and been selected properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like you find less dramatic
shifts within those phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you won't need to keep as many.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to have two that are
really comparable.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the point, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, like I mentioned,
going through a phenol hunt right now and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking really for a shorter plant
because the brisker OG side of things is
[SPEAKER_02]: very tall, stretchy, typical OG,
very finicky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it gets those heavy buds,
it will just be flopping all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the Pakistan Valley is real short
stout, real nice bud stacking and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stays upright.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really flop over like the,
like the brisker does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of keeping that plant short was
one of the things I was looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in this grow, I'm seeing that the
ones that are a little bit taller are just
[SPEAKER_02]: packed on with trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, oh great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, geez, do I really want to go for
the smaller one at this point or do I
[SPEAKER_02]: really want to look at the one,
you know, keep the one that has the just
[SPEAKER_02]: covered in trichomes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's no, it's not much of a
comparison.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the other ones are starting to stack
on trichomes here later on in flowering,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I thought was pretty interesting,
but like right off the bat, this
[SPEAKER_02]: particular phenol just stack with
trichomes and it really made me quite
[SPEAKER_02]: question whether or not I'm going to keep
the shorter one out of the bunch just
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's shorter, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the trichome production,
I mean, that's something that is more
[SPEAKER_02]: important for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, when I'm going to go through
smoking them all, consuming them all and
[SPEAKER_02]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was kind of interesting how things
kind of flip-flopped a little bit for me
[SPEAKER_02]: as I'm going through the hunt.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like that's the big thing too,
is as a connoisseur, I kind of like the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that I can get two holographics in my
Pokemon card, so to speak, in my Pokemon
[SPEAKER_01]: pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're before, you're each getting one,
you know, so it's like St. Louis Seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: will say, that's my analogy for you nerds
out there, is you can have more really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool options in one pack and we're
spending that kind of money on these.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people will be like, oh, which one
did you get?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the one that lean more brisker or
like that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you'd eventually have a cut that's
like, oh, this is the particular cut of
[SPEAKER_01]: this because there's two or three highly
sought after phenotypes in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think that's really cool in my
opinion versus like dud, dud, dud,
dud.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what I'm more used to with
a lot back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while those are usually more stable,
so to speak, that's what people will
[SPEAKER_01]: scream about.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a connoisseur, man, I like to have some
variations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are so many new growers that are
coming onto the market today and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've got Rhode Island that just
legalized, for example, there's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a whole bunch of people from Rhode
Island coming on to grow and they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to start pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a lot of beginner pheno
huntings that are tuning into this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: What advice do you have for someone who's
new to pheno hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you label properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be so bummed out when you're like,
oh man, I didn't label this pheno right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it could be this or it's this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes three more cycles to find
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to run them all again to be like,
ah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, cut's a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you won't know until part way through
the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're seeing some
characteristics, but how familiar are you
[SPEAKER_01]: with that plant when you just ran it for
everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost some great, great phenotypes,
great ones by being a moron and doing too
[SPEAKER_01]: much at once, doing three hunts with 10
packs or 10 per pack each.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm documenting all these different
phenotypes and just trying to find if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: male or female, let alone the
characteristics of what I want to keep or
[SPEAKER_01]: what I don't want to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's too many variables that come into
play.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't properly document and
track things, you're wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just growing out of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you physically label the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people have those like plastic tags
that actually wrap around the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people just do the plant tags that
you write on and stick within the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm doing this round is I took a
Sharpie and wrote on some painter's tape
[SPEAKER_02]: and then stuck it to the side of my
plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you label your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: The latter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good old, good old fashioned tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, it sometimes leaves an ugly mark
on your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's very easily visible to see
him like boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me right now, my left side is all
Chilado G's of my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know these are Chilado G's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look for A, B, C, you know,
easy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've only got A and B, which worked
out because those are the two I like the
[SPEAKER_01]: most.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have as much of an issue when
I organize it properly in that sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, not only will they be visibly right
there, but then I have it in my phone just
[SPEAKER_01]: in case humidity or some sort of thing
happens, the tape falls off, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that, I mean, they're in
trellis, so they're not moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being scrauged, like not fully
scrauged.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just being trellised.
[SPEAKER_01]: My other side is being more of the screen
and green technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know left over here, right over
here, it's like battleship, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: battlefield, battleship.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that in this coordinate over here,
this is this ship.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one over here, this is this ship,
meaning, you know, Chilado G's.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got my process done.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're doing a bunch at once and
you're moving stuff around and they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: all stationary, like very visible,
I think honestly, probably putting them
[SPEAKER_01]: right around the stem or the branch itself
for the, so we will do on the branch,
[SPEAKER_01]: the side, like an apple tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they'll do it around the base of the,
well, I'm just pretty medicated,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't even think of the word, the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you talked about documenting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure you have some sort of,
you talk about the columns.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it like a spreadsheet that you have
on your phone, like Google Sheets or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like, what does your tracking document
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on Evernote, you can add tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evernote's a free program where you could
do the premium version.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have premium because I use it for
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can have a table that you set up
and then you could do A, B, C,
[SPEAKER_01]: D, E, F, G.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lay them out like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's usually, I'll do it visibly or
visually like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way it's easy for me to just pop
it and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doom, doom, good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's linked to my Google Keep,
which says Fino hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can just click that, opens up
Evernote.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, it's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kind of correlates with my
cloner so I can see the cloner set up
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically in that, like the
numbers and letters, the first ones are
[SPEAKER_01]: always going to be the ones that are
actually in those letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other ones are going to just be my
grow tag because I don't have A,
[SPEAKER_01]: B, C in the grow tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know that it's laid out one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I do eight in my four by eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do four in my four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are in A, B, C, D.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty, for me it's simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do color coordinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was doing way too much Fino
hunting and I couldn't get enough colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, why can't we get like an Auburn
or like a lime green so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiate all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not easy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine's pretty similar to what you had
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Google Sheets, which is another free
program similar to Microsoft Excel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the columns, so up top,
I actually have the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever plant number it is,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the rows going down would be
the date.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just basically looking at the date
and then scrolling across to whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and then entering in my notes.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the things that you log?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like are you tracking feedings?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing pH, PPM?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing transplant dates?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what are you putting on that log?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll usually do feeding on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if I'm doing, for a long time,
I'd do like three times a week I'd feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the past year, I've been feeding
every time I water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go in the room and it seems like really
dry and I'm like, geez, the humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: fluctuates here in Michigan often.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at that point, I'll change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I noticed that the plant, if it's
having any signs of stress, that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mark it as like, all right,
well, I'm switching to flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's mark it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes with those ones, I don't have
to put anything back there again,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless it shows stress, but I at least
have it marked so I can go back and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: all right, at this time, and it shows the
last time the document was edited or it
[SPEAKER_01]: was modified on Evernote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, all right, this date,
did this here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, clearly that was the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very obvious to see like,
you know, I consume a lot of my products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to go back and check.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that gives a pretty good picture
of how you do your phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many different ways to
go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about just, you know,
some of the characteristics that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: look for.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know in the comment section
below for you guys tuning in, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: look for in your plants when you're phenol
hunting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you sharing your secrets
with us on how you do your phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm on a show with a dude named
Pigeon420 and another guy you may know,
[SPEAKER_01]: may or may not know, I'm not sure,
because it's Mr. Growett from this Dash
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: some garden updates here and there,
different things periodically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff that doesn't include my partner in
crime, not crime, all legal.

episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in the description, I'll definitely

[SPEAKER_02]: So the first episode, first time around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you haven't seen that one,

[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be a lot different.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was almost two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe how fast time has flyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the start.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we kind of started,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we linked up from the stash
game shortly after.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started just off of that episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we started a whole new podcast
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then continued on with the Garden
Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are two years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: So crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll leave it at that.
