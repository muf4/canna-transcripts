[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go buy calcium at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own calcium with
eggshells and vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using worm compost is one of the best
natural ways to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need guanos or cow manure or any
of those other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you need to gauge is
how much food waste are you producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much do you need to augment
on top of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, the worms aren't going to
escape because they don't like light.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the full benefits out of cover
crops, you need to chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, right, you should never have
naked soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a while, if you have a good amount
of soil and you have a good process going,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't actually have to go buy soil
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: in to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 38.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Hota Erb.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 35 years and he
has extensive knowledge when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farming or gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to be talking
about today.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll talk about what regenerative
gardening is, its benefits and several
[SPEAKER_01]: different practices that you can implement
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of this podcast who helped make
[SPEAKER_01]: that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Hota Erb.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really excited to have this
conversation with you today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have extensive knowledge when it comes
to regenerative gardening or regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: farming, whatever you want to call it,
KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a lot of these practices within
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also seen that you've been on other
podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And shows and just spilling a bunch of
good knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super excited to have you on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be pretty much like an,
I would say an introduction to
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of my audience, I would say is,
I would say a majority probably are home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and that they are probably more on
the bottled nutrient side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few organic gardeners as
well that are part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know there's a lot of people that
are looking to transition over to the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looking to start regenerative gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought this would be a good episode
to kind of be an introduction to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully viewers will be able to
get an understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least a basic understanding of what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully learn some practices that
they can implement in their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to hopefully provide some
fantastic names as well for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's just so much great work
going on all over the globe really in
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regenerative farming practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally got into growing things
because I grew up in a food business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was always around fresh foods,
fresh herbs and ingredients that my family
[SPEAKER_00]: used in the cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandfather was a butcher so he also
used to go get the full sides of beef.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad ran restaurants and used to
pick out all the vegetables and fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: things by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always had gardens going as well so
that we had fresh stuff to cook with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of rosemary's and spices and garlic
and onions and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents were always growing some type
of an ingredient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I got older and was continuing to
work in the food business we always had
[SPEAKER_00]: herbs available at the restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was usually something growing out
back that we would go and pick at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we were getting lots of fresh herbs in
and I always would tend to gravitate
[SPEAKER_00]: towards helping care for those plants and
helping bring the fresh stuff in and
[SPEAKER_00]: helping pick out the right types of
vegetables and things to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a real appreciation for high
quality food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's really where I got started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always been really interested in
just gardening and having those
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Year-round I put basil and parsley and
other things on my windowsill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep them under fluorescent lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do different things to keep them going
year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was talking with you earlier I've
started playing around with microgreens
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love microgreens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fantastically fantastic to taste
and tremendously beneficial health-wise
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative farming is really,
really important if you look at where our
[SPEAKER_00]: food comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately we've gotten very
disconnected as a society on where our
[SPEAKER_00]: food comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people's interaction with food is at
the store, the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no idea where it came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what the plant looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was picked off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not even know that much about the
animal that it came from either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that disconnection has allowed a lot
of practices that have been going on that
[SPEAKER_00]: have been harmful to the environment and
very impactful to all sorts of different
[SPEAKER_00]: things because our environment is
connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything impacts everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winds that blow in the Middle East
pick up nitrogen and sand that blows
[SPEAKER_00]: across in the atmosphere and lands in
Brazil and is actually one of the ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that the rainforests are neutrified.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in a big, large, global,
connected system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look closer to home and you
look at our agricultural practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately over the last 150 years and
really the last 70 years primarily,
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial agriculture has followed
practices that while they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce large amounts of food,
that food did not have a lot of nutritive
[SPEAKER_00]: value to it and all of those practices
were extremely detrimental to the land
[SPEAKER_00]: that those foods and animals were being
grown on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmer will grow on a bunch of land
and use it until it's basically just dead
[SPEAKER_00]: and then move on to another plot of land
and then move on to another plot of land
[SPEAKER_00]: and they keep going and going and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the property becomes so depleted in
natural biology and natural protections
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not able to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so regenerative farming is a whole
bunch of different practices that revolve
[SPEAKER_00]: around trying to regenerate the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, what we're trying to do is
leave the land better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than when we got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as opposed to this almost strip mining
approach that has caused us to lose 70% of
[SPEAKER_00]: the topsoil in the middle of the United
States that was responsible for the dust
[SPEAKER_00]: bowl, that's responsible for a lot of our
flooding and runoff problems and pollution
[SPEAKER_00]: within our oceans and rivers today is
because of this destruction of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of the natural environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can farm in ways though that help
actually regenerate the soils and help
[SPEAKER_00]: give back to the land and capture carbon
and stop runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's less flooding because the water
can flow down into these really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really healthy soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So regenerative farming is again looking
is looking for ways to rebuild and make
[SPEAKER_00]: things better than when we left them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic is not the same as regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an important thing to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic means that all of the things that
went into the making of that plant or
[SPEAKER_00]: animal were also certified organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds, the nutrients, the soils,
the teas, whatever was applied to those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants had to be certified organic for
them to be able to claim that this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: certified organic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, it's still in many cases
following bad commercial practices which
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to destroy the land like tilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tilling is one of the largest reasons why
we have so many problems with our soil
[SPEAKER_00]: health today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tilling has been around for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back even in US history,
some of our first presidents were
[SPEAKER_00]: promoters of tilling as a way to break up
the land and make it a little bit easier
[SPEAKER_00]: for planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, the way that we used to
till in those days with like just a big
[SPEAKER_00]: wedge dragged behind a horse was not as
bad as what we do today where we have
[SPEAKER_00]: these huge mechanized spinning discs that
cut through the soil and destroy all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the natural fungal and biological life
that's in that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the worms, all of the arthropods,
all of the fungal bodies, they get
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed by tilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you left with?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're left with a bacterial, a highly
bacterial soil that isn't as balanced for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This causes increase in weed pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It causes increases in pest pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it causes the soil to lose its
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It loses its ability to retain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to use more water to feed our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the loss of the fungal and
biological life in the soil, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't able to get as much access to the
minerals and nutrients that are in that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to add more stuff on,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if you're using an organic product
but you till your soil, you're still not
[SPEAKER_00]: following regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenerative practices are also great for
animals as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just about plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, the two together are a
symbiotic combination that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I think is really
interesting for vegetarians to consider is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we still need cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason is that we don't have the herds
of animals that used to exist in nature
[SPEAKER_00]: that would help with the basic biological
processes that regenerated the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their urine and defecation, their churning
up the land, but primarily in large herds
[SPEAKER_00]: that moved at very rapid paces and didn't
stay in one place for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of predators, that type of
movement, that type of activity is
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely beneficial for the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at places in the US where
they've actually allowed the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: buffaloes to come back, those grasslands
have come back from what they once were to
[SPEAKER_00]: once they once were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were, in some cases, almost
desertified because there wasn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: proper type of animals on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just holding cattle in pens outside,
though, is not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to rotate them much more often
than our practices are today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also need to keep them in smaller
pens to keep them clumped a little closer
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you get some of the benefits of
them stomping the ground and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down the cover crop and
vegetation back into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also creating small pockets where
water and bacteria can build because their
[SPEAKER_00]: hoof prints will actually create these
little puddles and microbiomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the urine, the feces,
and all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by keeping them rotating, you don't
allow those animals to eat all the
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation to the point where it's
detrimental to that land, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of brothers, and I think
the last name is Silva, but I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the last name, but they're doing
some stuff in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Oaxaca Desert, which is in between
Texas and Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically one of the largest
deserts in the world, the Oaxaca Desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, a large portion of their
property is in that desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they did was they changed the way
they moved their cattle, their cattle
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they changed the way they moved their
cattle and were able to actually rebuild
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire area of their land through
proper cattle rotation only.
[SPEAKER_00]: By using proper cattle rotation,
the natural species came back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The birds and the animals carried the
seeds, the plants spread, the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: moved with the water and the streams,
and things started to re-come back from
[SPEAKER_00]: being a desert, actually turned back into
a grassland, naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just by changing the way they moved their
cattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the use of cattle was necessary and
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing cattle across a field before
you do planting is a great way to help
[SPEAKER_00]: reinvigorate your field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with your neighbors, having your
neighbors maybe feed on some of your crops
[SPEAKER_00]: so that their cows are also getting some
of the benefits of your naturally grown
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also helping heal your land as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of great things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people to look at would be Dr. Elaine
Ingham, who is the person who coined the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really learn about the soil food web
because it's a tremendous, tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: important part of regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray Archuleta, Gabe Brown are also some
fantastic people that you can go find out
[SPEAKER_00]: more from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are definitely some names I
would recommend looking up and finding out
[SPEAKER_00]: more about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're interested in regenerative
practices, I follow primarily a family of
[SPEAKER_00]: farming called Korean natural farming,
which is a family, again, it's a Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: based natural farming set of practices
that utilizes natural inputs that you
[SPEAKER_00]: collect locally in your environment to
feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you collect plants to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use ferments, fermentation,
and vinegars and sugars and other
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques for capturing indigenous
microorganisms and building beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs for your own gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I do all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make all my own inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't buy anything at the store at the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go to a grow store, it's because I
need a new fan or something along those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't go to the grow store for
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually make all of my own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make FPJs, which are fermented plant
juice, FFJs, fermented fruit juices.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own calcium,
your own calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go buy calcium at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own calcium with egg
shells and vinegar or oyster shells and
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven days with a breathable cap,
and you have your own calcium for pennies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, really, really
interesting way of creating nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful way of farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of the inputs are, in many cases,
good for us as humans as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good for animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's approaches for chicken coops,
for no-smell chicken coops, and no-smell
[SPEAKER_00]: pigstyles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot, very interesting
stuff there, a lot to unpack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a quick recap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a short list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So regenerative gardening, some of these
things you said, some of them you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sungrown, you know, rely on the
sun to grow instead of kind of doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop rotation, closed loop on-site plant
nutrition, composting systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for watering, doing strategies through
soil management, irrigation methods,
[SPEAKER_01]: using rainwater, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talked about how it's beneficial to
animals, you know, healthy plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: companion planting, cover cropping,
on-site food systems, pest management,
[SPEAKER_01]: not relying on chemical pesticides and
herbicides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a whole bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be enacted here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, narrowing it down to kind of the home
grower, you know, the person indoors
[SPEAKER_01]: that's doing their own gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe they have a six or 12
plant setup or house plants or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about closed loop operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people, that is something
that you can enact within the home
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you first tell us like,
what is closed loop operations and what
[SPEAKER_01]: are some things that people can do at home
in order to implement that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually mentioned a few of them
already, but closed loop has to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: basically getting everything you need from
within the confines of your own property,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're running a farm, nothing comes
in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're building and utilizing all of the
things within your property to feed and
[SPEAKER_00]: support and nurture and sustain your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing for us as home
cultivators, whether you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: edible or medicinal plants, it really
doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even your regular house plants as well in
many cases can benefit from these systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as just a homeowner in general,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Composting is a tremendous benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to, if you have a
little bit of land, building an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: compost or getting a compost box or
something along those lines is a fantastic
[SPEAKER_00]: way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a great way to reduce your food
waste and your overall trash that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: sending to landfills and you're having
picked up and all those things you can
[SPEAKER_00]: take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your coffee grounds, your used tea,
your eggshells, the old vegetables,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ends, the green ends on the carrots
that you don't want to eat, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: different pieces all the things that you
strip off of the vegetables when you peel
[SPEAKER_00]: your carrots or the banana that just was
overripe and you didn't want to eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things can go in your compost
pile and can be recovered and re-nutrify
[SPEAKER_00]: your own for the benefit of your own
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So composting is outdoors is one way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you can do is as I
mentioned, vermicompost or worm farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's great for indoors because you
can have worms in a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep worms in a little box if you
really want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously they're only going to produce so
much worm castings and they're only going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take up so much waste if you have only
a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having a worm bin is a tremendous
benefit and actually one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using worm compost is one of the best
natural ways to feed your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need guanos or cow manure or any
of those other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, vermicompost is mostly all you
need and it has the benefit of providing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of natural organisms and fungi along
with it that help benefit the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: build soil structure and all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do put some worms in my pots
occasionally, but I tend to keep them in
[SPEAKER_00]: my worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use red wrigglers is the type of worm I
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my worms from Uncle Jim's worm farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I order them online if I need some new
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, once you get worms,
if you take care of them, you don't need
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will double every three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have 250 worms, you'll have 500
worms in three months and you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 1,000 worms in six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will grow to the size of your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will grow into your space and you can
do them and get a bunch of 35 gallon totes
[SPEAKER_00]: from Target and make your own worm bins
and keep these things in your basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go year round if you live in a
cold environment like I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It freezes in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't stir a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wood chips that I would normally add
for my browns are also frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves are frozen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're buried in snow or ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, the alternative in the
winter is a worm bin or doing some bakashi
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another great thing that you can do if
you have an apartment or a small space,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can actually do composting with
bakashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Japanese technique that uses
fermentation to convert your food wastes
[SPEAKER_00]: over to a product that breaks down very
quickly in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could do a 30 day ferment on your
food waste in a four or five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lid and then take that and mix it
with soil in a big tote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that cook again for another 30 days
and you will have an incredibly rich soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can use on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's lots of great techniques that
we can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a very small space,
you don't have to have a big compost pile
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and turning it and worrying about
temperatures and all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms are the best, but there's also great
approaches with bakashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who also, if you have
chickens, soldier flies is also a
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic way to do composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can deal with all the soldier fly
larva and all that, which the chickens
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a bit about composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use compost teas and that's one
of the primary ways that I feed my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: is I like to brew up a weekly compost tea
with an airlift brewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into that, sorry to cut you
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to dig a little bit deeper into
actually a worm bin because I'm actually
[SPEAKER_01]: starting it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually had a podcast episode with
Queen of the Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you know who she is.
[SPEAKER_01]: She actually found out I was not doing
composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could sense a little bit of
frustration in her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her just passion came out of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said that, like, you aren't doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't you doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a whip me into shape
type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went out, I started doing research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm about to go buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a plant in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: About to go buy the bins right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to buy the, I think they're 18
gallon bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to buy two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to double stack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have worms in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just talking about the inputs,
I think a lot of people probably in myself
[SPEAKER_01]: included, I'm kind of getting caught up on
what to input in there to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my plan is just things I have around
the house, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So junk mail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of junk mail that had come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So putting it through the shredder,
adding that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coffee grounds I was going to put in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I have basil plant and I have some
house plants that are kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of the leaves like die off
and stuff, put that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, lettuce, any salads that I don't
eat, banana peels, hair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you can put your own hair in there
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can even go that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of what other things I
plan to add in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the main things that I'm
going to be starting with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, grass clippings, clippings from plants
outside as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm like trimming bushes or whatever,
I was going to throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those tend to be a little bit more for
traditional compost piles, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: grass clippings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wouldn't recommend them bringing
them inside to your worm?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I would do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could bring in some of those
items from the outside, but you also got
[SPEAKER_00]: to remember your, your worms are only
going to eat so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you need to gauge is
how much food waste are you producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how much do you need to augment
on top of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, you want to start with
shredded paper and some fresh cocoa as the
[SPEAKER_00]: very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The base and you wet it, you know,
you want to squeeze it so that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it pretty much is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like squeezing out water,
but maybe a little bit of a drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to be too dry,
but you kind of mix that all together,
[SPEAKER_00]: that paper and that cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you put your worms down in that
and then give them a day or so to settle
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you want to start using all
the most of those things that you said are
[SPEAKER_00]: great with banana peels, apple cores,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to try to chop them up because
the smaller they are, the faster they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berries are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, you'll have to kind of gauge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes some plants they don't like,
especially the fresh leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may not like them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be a little bit too bitter or a
little bit too odorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't, some things they will actually
move away from until they break down or
[SPEAKER_00]: dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might need to, you might want to
let the plant material dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you need to keep an eye on
is your moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're putting in a lot of coffee
grounds and fruit and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may want to add some extra paper or
cardboard or things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will help balance off some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to get too moist in
there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to make sure that there's
some good drainage at the bottom of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever the bin is that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all good information that I'm
definitely going to be able to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned, I was going to do
the kind of like the double stack bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bin that's stacked inside the other
one is going to have the holes drilled
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you can look up any YouTube
video and see how they're drilling holes
[SPEAKER_01]: all over on the bottom and then up on the
top as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like not the top lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess a lot of people don't do the lid,
but they'll do like around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll put a couple air holes at the top
just because you don't want it to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: closed environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want some airflow to be able to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why they put a couple of those
holes at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in general, the worms aren't going to
escape because they don't like light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to stay away from the
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you open up the bin,
the lid on the bin, they're going to dig
[SPEAKER_00]: down in because they don't, they don't
want to be near the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if you have some holes on the
side, they're not going to crawl out
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're going to try to avoid the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from my understanding,
it should be, you know, once, once they're
[SPEAKER_01]: stacked in there, you do it kind of like
on a weekly basis to where on one week
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of putting things on one side
of the bin, you know, lightly covering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next week you're putting
something on the other part of the bin and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of moving things over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way there's some kind of rotation
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do quarters quarters.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of quadrants and move them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you need to gauge how fast the
worms are consuming what you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a lot of food left from the
previous one, you just let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't feed them again because you want to
give them time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want a large buildup of
composters and other types of smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms and insects that you'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will see some other small bugs
crawling around in there, but those are
[SPEAKER_00]: composters.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breaking those foods down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms don't actually eat the food in most
cases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're eating the molds and bacterias and
things that grow on the foods as they
[SPEAKER_00]: break down and their movements and
shooting through things is what helps
[SPEAKER_00]: break down some of those materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also love avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great thing to use melons,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to stay away from meats and
dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be doing mail,
be careful to get rid of those little
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic view windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want those in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be shredding your credit cards
because then you're putting really sharp
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic into your worm bin and the worms
aren't going to like that very much and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really don't want your plastics in
there anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always have mixed feelings about using
mail in general just because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they're printing it with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that goes into your worm bin is
going to go into the worms themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever goes into those castings is going
to go into your plants and then into you.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of inks are actually soap-based and
they don't tend to be chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most printers and things like that,
they actually print with a kind of a soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from things that are
very glossy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll stay away from and just try to use
things that are really just paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are electrical bills and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are fine, but I would shy away from
some of the really glossy printed stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes in the mail and some of those
flyers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cardboard is good, especially if you see
recycling symbols on it or made from
[SPEAKER_00]: recycled cardboard, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding, roughly 30 days
could be longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of variables with the
temperature and so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but roughly 30 days, then you kind of have
vermicompost, which you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take that and top dress your
plants with it, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my question is underneath,
so that second barrel is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting the waste, the vermicompost tea
type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a leachate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leachate, yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take for that to develop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will it ever go anaerobic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need to be moving it around so it
doesn't go anaerobic and bad pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would use it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something you want to store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would check your bins once a week,
at least, and then make sure that there
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't a lot of that moisture, that water,
and I would use it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That leachate, if you're going to use it,
I would not store it or keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not get any.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get any in my bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on your moisture levels of
your inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then that should be diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're going to top dress with
it, you are kind of diluting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In most cases, if you pour something on
the soil, it's kind of going to dilute
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally, but yeah, you could mix it in
with some water or something as part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate you taking some time to
answer my questions there because I am
[SPEAKER_01]: about to start, which is exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something new, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I said, I like to use the
vermicompost in a compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do is I use paint sprayer
bags, actually, paint strainer bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super cheap, and they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make these five-gallon strainer bags,
and you can put vermicompost and leaf mold
[SPEAKER_00]: and all sorts of things for whatever
you're using for your compost tea mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great, and they're easy to clean,
so you can wash them and use them over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how I like to use my
vermicompost instead of top dressing with
[SPEAKER_00]: it because I don't have enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had a lot of vermicompost,
then maybe I would probably top dress with
[SPEAKER_00]: it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to stretch it out, I think a great way
to do that is to use a cup or so in a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea brew and feed all of the
plants off of that tea brew as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: just using a tablespoon or two on every
one of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's also an easy way to do it is to
just walk around, put a tablespoon or two
[SPEAKER_00]: right on top of the soil, and the water
will naturally wash that stuff in and
[SPEAKER_00]: provide the benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about compost teas a little bit
more, is there anything beyond the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional things that we hear?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just traditional.
[SPEAKER_01]: People use five-gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fill about four gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put about a cup of compost in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they add a sugar source brew for
around 24 hours, some people up to 48
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I've heard that there's issues
going that long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything to kind of add to that process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of things actually that I
can add to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, if you're going to use
molasses as your sugar component,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure to work that molasses into some
warm water before you pour it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that is that molasses are
highly viscous.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may, in some cases, end up coating
some of the bubbles that are showing up as
[SPEAKER_00]: you're brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That coating actually creates a small
little anaerobic pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up brewing some anaerobic bacteria
as well as your aerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not fully getting the benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that molasses and mix it with
some water first, some warm water first to
[SPEAKER_00]: thin it down and break up some of that
viscosity and then pour it into your
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea, good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing is you should be aerating
the inside of your compost tea bag as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as the outside process that's brewing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run an airline into the bag itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's air bubbling inside the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm not getting an anaerobic
pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all that material meshes together and
in some ways blocks out some of the access
[SPEAKER_00]: to the oxygen in the water that's floating
around it, it's going to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic pocket as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to keep air inside those bags as
well as the air that's happening from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rotation of the tea brew process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third thing I'll mention is air stones can
be problematic because they build up
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria and not good bacteria over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you clean them or replace them,
you probably aren't going to run into any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, but I would highly recommend just
going without the air stone on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just run in the tube of air directly onto
the inside of the bag or into the bottoms
[SPEAKER_00]: of your thing or use an airlift brewer
like I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use as a better approach as opposed to air
stones and you'll avoid any possible
[SPEAKER_00]: issues from those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Korean natural farming, compost tea
or liquid IMO is usually brewed for 24 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tend to watch it by smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smell will change over time of your
brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start out with a sweet and earthy
smell, of course because you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses and some of those other
sweeteners in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get this earthy, natural,
sweet smell to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time though, if you go too far,
you'll actually start to get some moldy or
[SPEAKER_00]: rotting smells and that means that you
went too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things that we watch for
a lot in Korean natural farming are smells
[SPEAKER_00]: and tastes when we're creating our
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually we don't go beyond 36 hours
because you do start to run into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those conditions where you've started to
burn out the good bacteria and you're left
[SPEAKER_00]: with nothing but the bacteria who actually
are the cleaners, the bacteria that eat
[SPEAKER_00]: the other dead bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use air stones right now and I might
switch over.
[SPEAKER_01]: One tip that I've heard and what I've been
doing is in between brews.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I'm done brewing, I'll take the air
stones and I'll boil them in water so
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll kill off, the temperature gets so
high, it'll kill off any bacteria on there
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I personally do in order to
prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide could also be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you're cleaning them and
maintaining them, if you use them again
[SPEAKER_00]: and again every day and they're just
sitting there bubbling away day after day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to start to attract mold and
bacteria inside that stone that will do
[SPEAKER_00]: bad things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going off course here from
the list of questions I gave you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think it's really good that we're
going because there's a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: information here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some other things
that you think that home gardeners can do
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as implementation practices for
generative gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I think using composting is an
important practice that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: consider.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the great resources that most home
gardeners have access to actually is leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaf mold is an incredible input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, leaf mold is the stuff you find
underneath your pile of leaves that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: quite soil, but almost soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's pure humic, humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful, beautiful organic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually take that and mix that in
with your soils to give them an
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculation actually of natural organisms
and life that will help those plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: started if you're trying to follow into a
living and organic type of an approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that we should
probably cover is just real briefly soils
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot of different terms
for soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have soil-less mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have soil itself is sand, silt,
and clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic material and biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have actual soil if you don't
have the biological compound, the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what turns dirt into soil is the
life, the humic materials and the life,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also hear a lot of these terms living
soil and super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's common terms of phrase that are
used out there often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super soil is really a enriched soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super soil is actually a specific recipe
created by a specific person that had a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific set of materials and inputs in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: He coined super soil, but the reality is
it's an enhanced medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a true soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will refer to it as a
soil-less medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking soil and then you're mixing
in a lot of other compounds and
[SPEAKER_00]: substrates, peats, perlites, crab meal,
lobster compost, different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do that, you're getting away from
real true soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're creating what I like to refer to as
enhanced or enriched soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tends to actually be my base.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually use Costa Maine Stonington
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Costa Maine is my primary base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a tremendous amount of really good
organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made here in New England where I
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Costa Maine, I'm in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a product that's produced here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of peat in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has lobster compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some kelp meal and some other great
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an enriched medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil on the other hand is actually
a true natural soil that is alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're relying on the biology,
worms, arthropods, ciliates, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacterial and fungal life that you're
promoting to create the nutrients that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant needs to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do true living soil as a home gardener,
as a home grower, you need at least a 35
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which can be difficult for people indoors
especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something on wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have been moving into no
till beds, living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned no tilling earlier on in the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a fantastic approach for anybody
who's looking to go completely
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative, completely closed loop,
is using living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a two by two living soil bed is
actually, a two by two pot is about 35,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A three by three is about 75 gallons of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A four foot by four foot bed is actually
about 100 gallons of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine trying to lift 100 gallons of
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have to shovel the soil out
of those beds if you don't have them on
[SPEAKER_00]: wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people fill their tent with one
big four by four living soil bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowing, you're using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're utilizing worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're utilizing natural type,
you're using companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is also great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowing the, you're building
basically a natural environment that's
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and as close to a biodynamic
approach as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: As close to a natural approach as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to create the outdoors
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're allowing the plant to naturally
manage the biology and the soil to get
[SPEAKER_00]: what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fantastic approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a friend, Blue, who uses Avocado
Tech to help keep his living soil beds
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gone 16, 17 cycles in the same beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All he does is chop the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: He leaves all the roots and everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: He lets leaves and things fall to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got cover crops in there that he
chops and drops and smashes down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he also uses this great thing called
Avocado Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm actually having him on the
podcast soon to talk all about Avocado
[SPEAKER_01]: Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a fantastic guy and a great friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually went to a regenerative
conference together, which is where I met
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: His Avocado Tech is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes kind of a guacamole with some
crab meal and some other inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azomite and some good natural inputs makes
this guacamole and stuffs it back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado skin and puts it face down on the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is the worms actually come up
out of the soil bed and run through the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado and actually bring all that
nutrient goodness back down into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He uses three avocados an entire cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's his whole deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, he just has water
dripping with the Blue Mat system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an incredible water saving
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself don't run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to use as little water as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my plants wet, but I don't water to
run off, which a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to use just as much water
as I need to keep the plants wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to soak them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make sure that obviously
they don't develop dry spots, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep them wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Mats are a great system that is a
passive system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really even need any power for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use gravity and basically fill a
bucket of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these electrostatic carrots that
basically sit in the soil and detect soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the level of moisture,
they let water drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get these little drips of water all
day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually one of the most efficient
watering systems around because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the plants actually to dictate
the moisture level in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just get as much as they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're really thirsty, you're going to
use up some more water, but you're only
[SPEAKER_00]: using what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not pouring a ton on and having run
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then throwing that out, you're not trying
to recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all keeping maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that it only drips as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really, really great systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy using the Blue Mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have them plugged in right now,
but I'm probably going to be going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tend to develop some amazing root
balls as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really impressive root structures
when you use that type of an approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using Blue Mats and you see
pictures online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the roots coming up,
going towards the dripper, where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually dripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you're going to have to clog
your lines too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not keeping an eye on it,
the root will go all the way up into there
[SPEAKER_01]: and clog it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to be careful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get that saturation rate down as
far as what you want in that container,
[SPEAKER_01]: stick the carrot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it hooked up to your res,
just all gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using organics, you're just top
dressing the medium staying, that moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: level that it needs to be for that those
microbes to break down those amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much hands off compared to a
synthetic bottled nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're mixing nutrients every week,
sometimes twice a week in order to hand
[SPEAKER_01]: water your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always do that synthetic nutrients
in the Blue Mat as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clog those lines if you're not
careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to flush them often.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely have to be careful,
especially with some of the organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those tend to be thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use Medi One from Green Planet,
and that stuff is just sludge,
[SPEAKER_00]: the main base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an organic medical base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great product, really beautiful,
but I definitely wouldn't have fed that
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Blue Mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing let's talk about before we
wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into cover crops a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use the white Dutch clover right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's well known for nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take nitrogen in the air,
convert it to a form that's usable by the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant will be able to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, can you talk to us just about your
knowledge about cover crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: What other cover crops can we be using in
an indoor environment, home growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: any of the benefits of cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of mixes out there already
on the market, and most of them have a
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of different types of clovers,
white clovers, red clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which actually have different benefits,
both the red and the white clovers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vetch, sweet peas, different types of
grasses, and having a mix of different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of cover crops is actually a
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Ray Archuleta is up to 16 or 17
different crops in his mix that he's been
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and that he's using out in his
fields for cattle and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on what you're trying to
accomplish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's also been some information
out recently about clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start avoiding clover in some cases
because mites love clover.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you might not necessarily have
mites on your plants, they might be in
[SPEAKER_00]: your clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a trap plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be good for a trap plant to keep
the mites off of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might encourage that them to go after
the clover because they love clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a few folks out there,
I think Ted Hussey possibly, Kiss Organics
[SPEAKER_00]: or one of the other gentlemen.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually stopped using clovers in his
mixes because of the mite problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: can develop, especially with your
outdoors, using clover in your mixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love sweet peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beans are also great if you plant beans,
rosemary, thyme, even throw ... You can
[SPEAKER_00]: throw some of your companion plants in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calendula is a great plant to put in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marigolds, you can put those in there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have good IPM benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help keep pests away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lavender, thyme, rosemary, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing a living soil bed,
you may want to consider some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: perennial forms of that because there's
climbing forms of rosemary and thyme that
[SPEAKER_00]: you could grow for years and years and
grow it throughout your bed or in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and maybe bonsai it even if
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a good variety of plants in your
mix is really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue even, I think he even has squash
growing and some other vegetables and
[SPEAKER_00]: things in his living soil beds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the vetch and grasses and I still
use some clover in my mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well because of that nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some of the thing that people
should also remember though is that to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the full benefits out of clover crops,
you need to chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain that because I don't think people
know what exactly it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, you should never have naked
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use rice hulls and a mix of I do
a mix with some wood shavings,
[SPEAKER_00]: some bakashi and then a bunch of rice
hulls and I put about an inch,
[SPEAKER_00]: inch and a half deep on the top of my
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your soil covered at all times,
indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exposed soil outdoors is actually one of
the problems, one of the things that is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing climate change and CO2 release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, as they till the fields,
they turn the soil over and expose the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon in the soil to the oxygen which
creates CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon, oxygen, CO2 and it rises and
they've actually photographed NASA has
[SPEAKER_00]: maps that show the increases in CO2
release from space, the increases in CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: release at the times when they're tilling
all the fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually see this from space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely something that you want to
try to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to use those mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those green mulches or cover crops are
also beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cover crops themselves will,
in some cases, release beneficial things
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen fixing, like you were saying,
clover releases nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that's a great thing for your
lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get rid of the clover in your lawn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add the clover back in because if you add
the clover back in, you don't need Scott's
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer on your lawn because the clover
will help your grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get all the nitrogen you need from the
worms and the clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to then, what's called,
chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chop those cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cut them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snip, snip, snip, snip like mowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't cut them all the way to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea is you want to cut them so that
you're leaving some of the plant to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: back, like you mowing the lawn almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you leave that material in the pot,
in the soil, to become a natural mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: When plants grow, they are carbon capture
machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that a plant produces comes
with a carbon exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything, whether it's their smell,
their body, their leaves, their stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: their fruits, all of it has to do with a
carbon exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're part of carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has carbon in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are, as they grow, they are
capturing carbon and other minerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drop them directly into the soil
and allow them to go back into the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're re-nutrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're putting those minerals,
that carbon, and those vitamins and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients back into the soil where they
can be recaptured by the biology in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops themselves are beneficial
because they help retain moisture in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They help keep your soil covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, as we were saying,
they'll help add nutrients back into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cutting them down and dropping them in
also helps re-mineralize the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you take that stuff out, what's
happening is those plants are leaching
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals and nutrients out of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you chop them and take them away,
you basically lost all those minerals and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients from your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you drop them back in, you're putting
them back in the ground where they came
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then ideally, to really take advantage of
chop and drop, you need worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need biology in the soil that's going
to break down those compounds back into
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals and nutrients that the plant can
absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been practicing chop and drop for a
couple of grows now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's something I'm definitely going
to continue to do because it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saving on nutrients in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're putting it back into the system
that it was in, it's just breaking down
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the plant is uptaking it
eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a perfect example of chop and
drop, which a lot of people don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: think of, is when you're mowing your lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should keep those lawn clippings there
as ugly as they may be sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep them there because those are going to
break down and that'll rejuvenate your
[SPEAKER_01]: lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, you get to spend less
money on Scott's fertilizer if you do it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rake your leaves, mulch them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mulch them in, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely because that's all fantastic
beneficial nutrients back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you haul those things away,
you're robbing your environment of those
[SPEAKER_00]: great, great natural materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you look at the rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody cleans and picks those leaves up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants drop, they fall, they die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Animals swing through, break stuff,
eat stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are these extremely healthy
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everything is retained within that
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing gets taken out of that environment
and taken away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we covered quite a bit in this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this hour flew by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely a lot of great information
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think there's some
information here that home gardeners will
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to grasp onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: You explained it in a very
beginner-friendly manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully some of you guys will be able to
implement this into your gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm doing composting now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered a whole bunch of other things,
but really in the grand scheme of things,
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't cover a lot at all when it comes
to regenerative gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much more to it and maybe in
the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just scratched the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe sometime in the future we can
have you on for a part two and kind of get
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into things because I definitely
think there's a lot of other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we could have covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I appreciate your time here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage people to look for
opportunities to use the things they have
[SPEAKER_00]: around them in some way, shape or form,
whether it's your food waste, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: your leaves, grass clippings, plants,
all of the stuff around you are natural,
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial items that can be incorporated
into your garden in some way, shape or
[SPEAKER_00]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your soils covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have naked soil and look for
opportunities to keep the plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, keep the ground intact when you
harvest as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So chop the plant at the stock,
leave the roots in there, let that
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, let all those natural,
wonderful things that are going on in that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't rip it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant right next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in small pots, obviously you're
going to be having to redo those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really do living soil in a five
gallon pot, as I was saying earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in pots, you can actually
recycle your soil even.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're done with your cycle of
that plant, take the roots and rinse the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can soak those roots in water and that
will pull sugars and exudites out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use them also to feed your
plants and water your plants with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save that soil and actually add
compost and natural things back into it
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it cook over the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the spring, you can utilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it in bins in your basement as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take a mix in worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take your worm castings, mix it in with
some of that used soil and maybe do a
[SPEAKER_00]: little avocado tech on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after a while, if you have a good
amount of soil, and you have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: process going, you don't actually have to
go buy soil either.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build up to the point where you
have a good pile of soil that you recycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can remineralize so that you can
use it over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another place where you can look to
preserve and save some money and try to do
[SPEAKER_00]: some more regenerative practices and
really looking to, again, reduce waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the best thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for opportunities to use the things
around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in the middle of Kansas,
you don't need oyster shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you have upcoming in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can be found every day on Instagram
where I post pictures of my garden every
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can also be found extremely frequently
on Clubhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that are unaware,
Clubhouse is an app that's available on
[SPEAKER_00]: both iOS and Android.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's free to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be invited anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a fantastic audio only
conversation app.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm on there having conversations
with people about growing and agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I host a show every Thursday
night at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern, 6 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific, which is also simulcast on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will provide a link to his
