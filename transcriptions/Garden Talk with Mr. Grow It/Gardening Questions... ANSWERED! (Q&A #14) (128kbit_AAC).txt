[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Chris, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_00]: MrGrowit, and today I've got a Q&A video
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time tuning into one
of my Q&A videos, I actually record them
[SPEAKER_00]: live on Twitch, and it's my goal this year
to record a new one each month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have questions that you want to
ask me, head on over to twitch.tv slash
[SPEAKER_00]: MrGrowit, hit the follow button,
and then you'll be notified when I go live
[SPEAKER_00]: next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you tune into one of the live
streams and ask a question, you may be
[SPEAKER_00]: featured in a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I have rambled on enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still growing Freak Show?
[SPEAKER_00]: I harvested that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got two cuts from Humboldt Seed Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were at MJBizCon, and I was just
crazy to think that it was over a year
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually got that harvest,
both those plants, and I didn't continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't clone it and not continuing on
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't crazy about like the bud structure
and the way it grew and so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something I'm going to keep in
my garden, but I actually still do have
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the harvest and good smoke,
definitely good smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any experience with blue mats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 12 pack of blue mats that I've
been using for several years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using them off and on, no good reason for
why I've been using them off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hand watering is fun sometimes,
but the blue mats are so awesome because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're so hands off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it hooked up to a 14 gallon
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sufficient for me because normally
I'm growing between like six and 12
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 14 gallon reservoir, top it off every
three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not too much maintenance on my
side, but I love the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a little bit to dial them in to
begin, but once you put them down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, the medium should be the proper
moisture level, then stick them down in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course just follow the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have really good instructions on how
you set them up and they've worked out
[SPEAKER_00]: great for me, particularly when top
dressing with organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one little tip I'll mention that I've
been trying has been working out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will top dress the organic
amendments and they'll top dress across
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire medium, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these blue mats, particularly with
the dripper, I'm using just the one
[SPEAKER_00]: dripper down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people actually have a hose that kind
of wraps around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do that, but I've been basically
trying to get the amendments to be right
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath where the blue mat has been
dripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to have been working out
pretty good because when I have amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other side of where the dripper is,
the medium doesn't stay moist on that
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the only downside of
blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have had issues with
blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly them not being set up
correctly or failing on them and then
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding their grow tents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been fortunate enough to not have
that issue, but I really do like blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly recommend blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, shout out to our sponsor,
Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell some really good grow tank kits,
actually simple kits for beginners,
[SPEAKER_00]: really everything you need, just adding
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have kits with the automatic
water system from Blue Mats and Autopods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about blue mats earlier
and a lot of them come with the AC
[SPEAKER_00]: Infinity products, quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to their kits
down in the YouTube description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did I mention that the kits include my
book?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: My beginner grow book is actually included
in their kit, which I thought was pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a collaboration I've had with
Happy Hydro, including my book and all
[SPEAKER_00]: their kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to them and my viewers
use discount code GROWKIT at checkout.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 10% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again to Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using regular water and
humidifier?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually have tried using tap water
and humidifier way back in the day and it
[SPEAKER_00]: turned out to be a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is because I have so many
minerals in my tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hard water and the minerals on the
tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is there will be like a white
fuzz that kind of comes out from the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier and gets all of your plants
inside of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe it or not clogs up the carbon
filter, restricts airflow, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: that carbon filter sock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And has been no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ever since then, I've been using RO
water for many, many years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use distilled water,
but pure water without minerals in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you still have a worm bin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a worm bin for a little over a
year and a half now, actually created a
[SPEAKER_00]: worm bin for composting, added in a brick
of cocoa, some paper shreddings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm adding in the usual coffee
grounds, any greens that are left over,
[SPEAKER_00]: banana peels, those are mostly what I'm
putting in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some eggshells, although the eggshells,
I made the mistake of not grinding them
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eggshells, you should be grinding them
up completely into a powder and then kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of putting it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what I believe you should
be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when I just crumpled them up my
hands and put them in there, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're still breaking down now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't do that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I still have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alive and kicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some red wigglers in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some European night crawls in there
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just trying to get some diversity in
the worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does Mr. Canucks do interviews?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you try to get him on your show?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been invited to both my show as well
as FTS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The response I got from him is he doesn't
go on shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't go on shows or podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but he mentioned that, hey,
if that changes, it'll hit me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fingers crossed everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regarding Blue Mat, how would you go about
feeding advanced nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just water in or run through the Blue Mat
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would do is I would use it in
the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do your weekly mixture according
to their feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have it broken down between weeks,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what you're aiming for
to put in the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people go with a half dose or
even a quarter dose of what's recommended
[SPEAKER_00]: on the feeding chart to begin to make sure
they're not, there's no toxicity issues
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, especially with the auto
watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have something dripping down like
that at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably want to start with a half dose
or even a quarter dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, mix it right up in your
reservoir, pH adjust, and then check on it
[SPEAKER_00]: each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might need to fill it up
depending on how much the reservoir was
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also add in water if you make your
mixture too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You check the C on it or PPM and you're
like, oh, this is too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't going to be, this might lead to
a toxicity issue in my plant because maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, add in water and dilute it
down a little bit, a little tip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'd mix it right in the
reservoir and have it dripping down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't, I wouldn't go about like
cutting off the reservoir at all or in
[SPEAKER_00]: hand watering nutrients like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the surfactant you use for IPM
again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just use Dr. Brunner soap just a
little teaspoon of it within water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do a teaspoon within 48 ounces
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do a teaspoon within a gallon
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then adding in some essential oil
drops is what I've done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it as often now since I use the
mammoth can control, but I was using
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosemary, putting a bunch of drops in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppermint was another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then neem oil I was using that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Dr. Brunner soap, very common
thing used for surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some people would just use Dawn dish
soap, but I know there's some controversy
[SPEAKER_00]: on whether or not chemicals are involved
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in organics, have you had the top soil
turn hard cement like, is this from drying
[SPEAKER_00]: out too often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming you're talking about the
amendments, kind of the organic amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed into that top part of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's drying out,
it's hardening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've come across that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so since then, I've been adding in
mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been adding in cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been adding in soil on top of those
amendments in order to try to avoid that
[SPEAKER_00]: from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been working out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's really hard to sometimes
mix in those amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you water it in, making sure that
that top layer stays moist, it's always
[SPEAKER_00]: been a challenge for me at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding in a mulch layer on top of it
has kind of helped prevent that from
[SPEAKER_00]: occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has happened to me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever see yourself growing in a
living soil bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a two foot by four foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I already am growing in a living
soil bed, but it's outdoors, vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a two foot by 10 foot bed by
Grassroots Fabric Pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make some really good living soil
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, lettuce, kale, bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some carrots in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the living soil bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as for medicinal varieties and
indoor, I have a two foot by four foot
[SPEAKER_00]: bed, but I never actually set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some concerns because I could be
moving maybe this year, but I hate to fill
[SPEAKER_00]: up a two foot by four foot bed and then
have to move it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the only thing holding
me back from setting up a bed indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you considered putting fruit in the
medium to decompose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would that help with the microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally you want to put fruit or
veggies or stuff like that in compost
[SPEAKER_00]: first and let the microbes cycle that and
turn that into a compost before adding it
[SPEAKER_00]: into your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the temperature will kind of rise when
things are being composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally people aren't putting things
like that, like fruits or leafy greens or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that directly into the
medium and burying it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they are, they don't have, generally
don't have plants in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying nobody's ever done it and
nobody's ever been successful doing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's just kind of the general route
that people go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've mixed up plant material in bucket of
soil before and just let that sit for
[SPEAKER_00]: several weeks and then planted a plant
into it and been fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now never put fruit directly into the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever done that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never really even heard of anybody
doing that, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you ever do a freak show run again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about that a little while
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're here for that or
not, but I had a successful harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have some right now, but I did not
keep it in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty kind of finicky grower in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any thoughts on throwing in a handful of
worms in each pot to assist in
[SPEAKER_00]: decomposition and adding fresh castings to
the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them in seven gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably wouldn't go with any smaller
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use worms if using synthetic
nutrients, but organics, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually shifting up to a 10 gallon
grill pot for organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually emptying out the soil from
my seven gallon containers that I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: reusing for several years now and then
putting them into 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like with the bigger
containers better for numerous reasons,
[SPEAKER_00]: but particularly with the worms,
which was you're asking you about,
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of gives one more room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely recommend red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use European night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And African night crawlers are the three
worms that you can kind of check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just purchased from uncle Jim's
worm farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So online source, just Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people will grab stuff
locally as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to Walmart one time and the bait
section, they have worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have red wigglers there and they
looked awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never ended up getting it,
but some people will go to their local
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart or bait store and get worms there
because you can pretty decently cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably get them a lot cheaper than uncle
Jim's worm farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another blue mat question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of blue mat questions this episode,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I travel for work nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use blue mat in my one gallon then
transplant my carrot and plant into my
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can simply take that carrot,
lift it up from that one gallon and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: into that seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to adjust the dial and stuff
to redial it in because it's, it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a different moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, I found that dialing redialing
it, recalibrating it, whatever you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it in that new container,
you'll find yourself having to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like always, yeah, just make sure that
that new container that you're putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: in is of the proper moisture is of the
ideal moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way when you hop in, when you pop in
that blue mat carrot and dial it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should stay at that ideal moisture
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can take it from one,
one to another and switch it over real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's been the most challenging thing
about growing besides your humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of challenges out there,
isn't there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So humidity is certainly been a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I assume you watch my videos,
you know that I have very low humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 21% is what I'm seeing right here in this
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's super tough in my grow room to
keep the humidity up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have humidifiers in there 24 hours,
three of them actually in that grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: and into grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, other challenges, heat can
certainly be a challenge, particularly in
[SPEAKER_00]: the summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I talk about pretty
recently on the podcast I released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically during the daytime when the
temperature reaches up to a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, 110 degrees outside, it's tough
to keep the temperature down indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when I have a grow light on,
you know, it's generating heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to just stick with, you know,
12, 12 photos during the summertime,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep my lights off during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other challenges, I mean, I think
everybody comes across the challenge of
[SPEAKER_00]: just keeping the plant healthy,
you know, the nutrition, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in soil and having the right
nutrients in there, right balance of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been so many times where I've had
grower error, overfeeding, underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think it's a challenge to
dial in feeding, you know, it definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: takes a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly top dressing organics,
organic blends in particular can make
[SPEAKER_00]: things a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're just focusing on keeping the
medium moist and not so mixing up
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients on a weekly basis in a
reservoir, pH adjusting, and then soil
[SPEAKER_00]: drenching your plants.
