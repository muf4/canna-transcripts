[SPEAKER_01]: One of the hottest products on the market
today for home growers is this automatic
[SPEAKER_01]: dry and cure machine called the Canitrol
CoolCure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thought that you can get pinpoint
accuracy and 100% stable drying and curing
[SPEAKER_01]: while being completely hands off is a
complete game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this video I'll show you how I've dried
and cured for the past 13 years and how
[SPEAKER_01]: drastically different it is now with the
Canitrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also provide a complete review of the
Canitrol including as many details as
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant and we'll also talk about the
pros and cons of this machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclaimer, I'm not being paid for
this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't accept money for review
videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a mixed opinion on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've come across many videos that were
paid reviews and they talk 100% positive
[SPEAKER_01]: and hide the negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll definitely hear both the good
things and the bad things about this
[SPEAKER_01]: machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did reach out to Canitrol and asked them
for a discount code for my audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said they don't do discount codes but
they gave me a special link that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: click on to see the best price available
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That link will also show you discounts on
multiple units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a military discount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave that link in the description
section below and also as a pinned
[SPEAKER_01]: comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright let's get into the Canitrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the Canitrol CoolCure for
nearly five months now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with storage and then did a dry
and cure cycle when I had plants ready for
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CoolCure dimensions are 28.25 inches
by 17.75 inches by 20.5 inches and the
[SPEAKER_01]: weight is 60 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: The internal capacity is 2.49 cubic feet
and holds four to five pounds of dry
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wet load should not exceed 2.2 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can set both the temperature and the
dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dew point relates to relative
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: More on that in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the unit pulls only 70 watts from the
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had this unit on for 24 hours a
day and your cost per kilowatt hour is 12
[SPEAKER_01]: cents, like it is in my state,
then you're spending about six dollars and
[SPEAKER_01]: five cents per month on electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: In their user manual, Canitrol recommends
four days of drying at 68 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit temperature and a 54 degree
Fahrenheit dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: By using temperature and dew point,
vapor pressure is controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They recommend a four day cure cycle at 68
degrees Fahrenheit temperature and a 52
[SPEAKER_01]: degree Fahrenheit dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for storage, they go back to 68
degrees Fahrenheit temperature and a 54
[SPEAKER_01]: degree Fahrenheit dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bit different from the
60-60 rule that I know a lot of you like
[SPEAKER_01]: to dry and cure at.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could absolutely change both the
temperature and get the humidity to 60-60
[SPEAKER_01]: on the Canitrol if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just figured it was relevant to mention
their personal recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be wondering why they don't go
with the 60-60 method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually found their answer in this
video that's on their YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a common question we get, 60-60,
does your box do 60-60?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does 60-60 come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: 60-60 is a dry bulb temperature of 60
degrees and a relative humidity of 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, up until now with legacy systems,
you would use an air conditioner like this
[SPEAKER_00]: to dry the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set your thermostat to 68 degrees,
the compressor wouldn't run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to turn down the temperature in
order to cause the compressor to run.
[SPEAKER_00]: To dry the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you take the thermostat and
start hitting the down button,
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It only goes down to 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where 60 came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 60% relative humidity happens to be a
good place to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the 60 degrees came from the limits of
a mini split.
[SPEAKER_00]: With our system, you're drying at the
optimum temperature of 68 degrees and a 54
[SPEAKER_00]: degree dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turns out a far better product than what
you get at 60-60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's stick with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've been gardening for 13 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all those years, I set up a specific
area for drying each harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've dried in spare bedrooms, bathrooms,
but usually dry in a grow tent that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not growing any plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to ensure proper air flow with
oscillating fans, proper air exchange with
[SPEAKER_01]: either an inline fan or opening my grow
tent one to two times a day to exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to make sure that my humidifier had
water in it at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you use a dehumidifier instead due
to being in a different climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to hang a temperature and humidity
monitor near the buds, and I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: squeeze the buds or snap the stem and
remove them from the drying environment
[SPEAKER_01]: before they became overdry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once dry, I had to put them into jars for
storing and then broke the jars at least
[SPEAKER_01]: one to two times per day for at least the
first few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do any of that anymore
with the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply harvest the plant, put it into the
Canada Troll and then turn the unit on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mentioned a wet the sponge that they
provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And set it on a shelf on the second day of
drying and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to empty the drip pan in the
back of the unit twice when on a dry
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of those things are very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the pros and cons of this
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pros.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands off drying, curing, and storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no setting up a dry environment,
no inline fans or oscillating fans,
[SPEAKER_01]: no filling humidifiers or emptying
dehumidifiers, and no burping jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can adjust the temperature and dew
point to what you desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unit is small, and compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the unit can actually be locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide two keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Low noise has a maximum of 35 decibels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes with a one year warranty
covering parts and labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's get into the cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that could be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one, there is only one size option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are a lot of people who are
looking for bigger units.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is simply one size that they have
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, the controller on top of the unit
takes up space.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is probably a small con to most of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see the digital control built
into the machine, preferably on the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing to mention that there is
some smell, particularly when drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of people out there
that use the Canada Troll and a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people say there's no smell whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally, maybe it's just because I
was sniffing for it, but particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: during the dry period, I did notice smell
when walking by the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured it was worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you put the buds into the cool
cure and set it onto the rack,
[SPEAKER_01]: flat spots can occur on the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you flip over the buds after
the first 24 hours, you can avoid the flat
[SPEAKER_01]: spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually didn't know this at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did see the flat spots after the
fact is when I was told, Hey, flip it over
[SPEAKER_01]: after the first 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some people actually recommend
another 24 hours after that flip it over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't see any flat spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally don't care much about the
flat spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am just growing and consuming for
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bag appeal really doesn't matter to me,
but I know there are some people out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that bag appeal is a big deal for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely just want to mention that
tip there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip it after the first 24 hours and
potentially again, after the next 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another con of this machine that I wanted
to mention is that there is no app control
[SPEAKER_01]: here in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of grow equipment out there
where you can simply pick up your
[SPEAKER_01]: smartphone, go into an app and you can see
the different settings and adjust the
[SPEAKER_01]: settings from your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Canada troll doesn't have
that capability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be really nice to not only set the
dry cure and storage cycles on there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also be notified when things such as
the sponge dries up and water needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: added to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the drip pan on the back needs to be
emptied right now, the only way of me
[SPEAKER_01]: knowing that the sponge has dried up is if
I walk by the unit and look at the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: digital display yesterday, actually I did
walk by and see the dew point had dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I noticed that, Hey,
I need to wet the sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had not looked at the digital display
there, and maybe a couple of days later
[SPEAKER_01]: went by everything within that unit could
be overdry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be really nice to get a
notification on my smartphone when I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to add moisture to that sponge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned before, the drip pan
as well on the back, particularly during
[SPEAKER_01]: the drying period, I did need to empty it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I wasn't monitoring that area at
all, it could easily overflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, maybe in the future,
this is something they could look to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last con, but not least con is
probably the biggest gripe from people,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the price of the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could totally see the price of this unit
being out of a lot of people's budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a lot of people are really
excited about this technology and they
[SPEAKER_01]: want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they see the price and realize
it's really out of their reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this unit was priced lower,
I'm sure a lot of people would be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely worth mentioning as a
con because it's definitely the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: gripe that I've seen in the comment
section from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So price, that's the last con I get to
mention today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually released a video on the Canada
Troll a few months back and there were at
[SPEAKER_01]: least a few people who compared it to a
wine fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said a wine fridge would actually
work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we had at least one person
follow that advice and the result was very
[SPEAKER_01]: bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They purchased a wine fridge, attempted to
dry their plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: After checking their buds, just three days
later, they realized their buds were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually over dry and they had a small hay
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a wine fridge, you can set a specific
temperature, great, but you can't set the
[SPEAKER_01]: dew point or relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The inside of a wine fridge is actually
too low of humidity to dry plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll result in the plants drying too
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put a hygrometer in my wine fridge and
it showed 22% relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: so super low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you're just talking about storage
only, thumbs up in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually what I used before using
the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used glass mason jars with the humidity
pack in them and I also used Grove bags
[SPEAKER_01]: that were heat sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those worked great, but I wouldn't
compare a wine fridge to a Canada Troll
[SPEAKER_01]: and I caution people who are looking to
purchase a wine fridge for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing people are comparing the
Canada Troll to is a humidor because you
[SPEAKER_01]: do have control of the temperature and you
have some control of the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keyword, some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone linked me to this Wittner CHC 120S
stainless steel humidor and I looked
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That unit does have an adjustable
thermostat with a temperature range of 50
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees Fahrenheit to 66 degrees
Fahrenheit, but that unit doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: way to adjust the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll automatically go up and down between
62 and 75%, which depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is most susceptible to mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: That unit is actually smaller than the
Canada Troll, so it can't hold as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidoids that people link me to
require either humidity packs or beads and
[SPEAKER_01]: specify the humidity adjusts between a
specific range, so humidoids don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the pinpoint accuracy to which you can
digitally set the dew point or relative
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity like you can with the Canada
Troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: All in all though, I do think the pros
outweigh the cons and I will absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to use the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has made drying so much easier and I no
longer have to worry about over drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have branches in there right
now that I have been avoiding trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think I put in there two months
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm sure many of you know, the trimming
process is very tedious and time
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get to it eventually though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pass this question off to you
though.
