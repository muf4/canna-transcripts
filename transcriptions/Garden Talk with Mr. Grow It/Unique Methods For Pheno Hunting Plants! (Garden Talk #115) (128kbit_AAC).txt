[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast where
we interview growers from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: in to the Garden Talk podcast,
this episode number 115.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Jordan River.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 14 years and is
the host of the Growcast podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a lot of experience of feno hunting
in different areas, and he's currently
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a feno hunt in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get deep into feno hunting in this
episode, everything from the basic
[SPEAKER_01]: terminology, how he does his feno hunts,
his current hunt in Hawaii, and other ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to go about feno hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That channel is dedicated to short clips
of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a gardening channel where I
have over 130 videos showing the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link that channel down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lastly, one of my goals for this
podcast is to bring free information about
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening to the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: My entire ventilation system is AC
Infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have their in-line fan, ducting,
carbon filter, and their controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the Controller 69 Pro, with
temperature, humidity, and VPD
[SPEAKER_01]: programming, and having control of
different fan speeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes it so much easier to control my
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their Controller 69 Pro version also
controls their oscillating fans,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow lights, and humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The discount code MRGROWAT15 works on both
Amazon and their website, acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using Stash Blend for over a
year now, and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I really like is
that it saves me money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole bunch of different inputs in
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I no longer have to go out there and
buy a silica bottle, then a separate
[SPEAKER_01]: seaweed bottle, beneficial bacteria,
then a separate one for mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that plus more is in this one
blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to stashblend.com to learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a link down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Jordan River.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, how's it going, Mr. Growat?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look relaxed out there in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you are, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to make the rest of the
country jealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been hit with a snowstorm,
but yeah, I'm out here in Malakai,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii, the desert island, and life is
good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a fino hunt out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're relaxing in the sun, and yeah,
I'm very relaxed, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Life is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you were on the podcast once before,
episode 101, which no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually had to take that down due
to a third-party complaint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't get into the details on that one,
but I think there was like 10,000 or
[SPEAKER_01]: 15,000 listens or views before it got
taken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good information there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talked all about living soil, and it was
really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this episode, we're going to kind of
switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit, like you mentioned,
you're in Hawaii, fino hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great to have a whole episode
around fino hunting and kind of what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the other episode got taken down,
we're really on a blank slate here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a wanted man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming after my content,
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your show is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love educating people.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who are tuning in for the first
time, my name is Jordan River.
[SPEAKER_00]: I host Growcast podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a cultivation education podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find us everywhere, Spotify,
all those places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you'll love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, it started as a medicinal
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was a teenager, I suffered from
grand mal seizures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started to get into medicinal plants
as a teenager and using them, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was actually kind of an up and down
ride with my health and with my epilepsy,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably because of the availability of
the products back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't growing my own medicine at the
time, but I got really into the medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up moving to Humboldt County at
age 20 and started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've even told this story
before on my podcast, but it all started
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was walking down the streets of
Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm from the Chicagoland area and we went
into the city for a night out,
[SPEAKER_00]: me and my sister and my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was walking down the street talking
to my sister about how, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Time magazine had just come out with the
big front page with the leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I want to go to Humboldt
County and cultivate professionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my dad heard me and he goes,
you know, your uncle Jackie lives out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald triangle and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he connects me with uncle Jackie,
connects me with the cousin, Benny.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all like family members who have
sometimes been on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put me in touch with the boys in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just from there, it was,
it was all fate, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up moving to Humboldt County,
finding Wolfman, my cohost.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was working at Bayside Garden Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent five years there providing
medicine for patients, which was some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the best years of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at 24, 25, I started recording
with Wolfman.
[SPEAKER_00]: We turned on the microphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We said, Hey man, every time we get
together, we can't not talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we might as well just turn on the
microphones and broadcast this to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I do Growcast as a full-time
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our mission is Overgrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea of Overgrow is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If everybody who wanted to grow did grow,
we would all have enough fresh vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: and fresh medicine available for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can come along, like I said,
tune into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're doing a big Fino hunt here
on the islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's a pretty small Fino hunt,
but it's, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come and follow along and we'll see how
this goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see if I don't fall flat on my face
here in the islands.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as usual, I will have a link to the
guest in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jordan, I'll have you a link to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your channel down in the description
section below on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, just listening, just search
[SPEAKER_01]: Growcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come up there on the search and then
you'll be able to tune into his content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fino hunting, man, let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's step it back for the beginners
though, first, because I have quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: beginners here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not know what a phenotype is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not know what a genotype is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you break down those two things for
us?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is a genotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to compare it to humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy to understand when two
parents have a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: That child is uniquely its own individual
and that child inherits many of the traits
[SPEAKER_00]: from their parents, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got blue eyes, just like your dad
inherited that trait.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genotype is the actual genetic coding
and the traits that got inherited from the
[SPEAKER_00]: parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like the hard coded data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genotype is in the DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it are traits that are present or
not present that determine how the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to express.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, able to produce anthocyanin,
that purple pigment that many plants
[SPEAKER_00]: produce, or not able to produce
anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is not able to produce
anthocyanin, there's nothing you can do to
[SPEAKER_00]: coax that expression out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the actual genetic information that
was inherited from the parent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, phenotype is how that plant
expresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how it turns out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of variability in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phenotype includes environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It includes you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you fertigating?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your nutrient schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your environment like as far as the
climate?
[SPEAKER_00]: This all plays into phenotype expression
and that is why your phenotype is uniquely
[SPEAKER_00]: your phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen before that someone will
get the same plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll get a cutting of a plant and grow
it and it turns out different than their
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe their buddy even grew it in a very
similar indoor control environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it just came out different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny how that came out different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the phenotypical differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the phenotypes expressing
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics also change over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's really important
to understand, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because environment does affect your
genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way epigenetics work is that genetics
affect our outcomes and our actions affect
[SPEAKER_00]: our genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you smoke a pack a day and your kid
smokes a pack a day and their kid smokes a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack a day of cigarettes, their progeny is
going to have different predispositions
[SPEAKER_00]: than if you had not taken those actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why doctors want to know if you
have a family history of this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing happens with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics will alter the DNA over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viruses and viroids will get into the
genetic code and change the way they
[SPEAKER_00]: express.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to plants, what we're really
talking about is not so much smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: pack a day, but the terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terroir, this idea of the total
totality of the plant's habitat affecting
[SPEAKER_00]: how the plant expresses itself,
the dirt, the way that the soil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes in the soil affect that plant's
flavor, the salt air, something about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terroir influences and changes genetics
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out here in Hawaii and I was talking
to some OGs about Maui Waui.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to provenance, a lot of
people have different stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to Maui Waui, they're saying
this is a Oaxacan plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a Mexican plant that was brought
to Hawaii and acclimated over several
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It changed the way it expresses and now
it's a different variety than we're used
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's about the genotype,
which is the hard-coded inherited traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about the phenotype, which includes
that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That environment really is terroir,
which will alter your genetic expressions
[SPEAKER_00]: over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good beginner-friendly way to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you broke it down like that
because again, we have so many beginners
[SPEAKER_01]: that are tuning into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what phenotype is,
what genotype is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an easily digestible way of
explaining it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for breaking that down to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, pheno hunting is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is pheno hunting and why would you do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, Mr. Growett, speaking to
the beginners is what it's all about,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't convey your information to a
beginner, your information isn't very
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how much stuff you've got up
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you to cater to beginners and to get
more people growing, that's what overgrow
[SPEAKER_00]: is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the idea of what is pheno hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you explain it to somebody?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with a story, a story
about a conversation I had with a
[SPEAKER_00]: non-grower friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, Jordan, you care for these plants
so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You name them and coddle them and talk to
them and grow them up perfectly healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at the end of their life cycle,
you kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chop them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You burn them sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, do you ever feel bad about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was a really funny and
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah, you do care for this
plant and then eventually it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: end up being thrown in the fire,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, I don't feel bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel bad about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unequivocally, the answer is no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is something called the
botany of desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a concept that plants want to
please us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants want to fulfill our desires and
it's beneficial for them as a species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have been on this planet much
longer than humans have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants have been on this planet hundreds
of millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're only a handful of thousand as
humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are very adept at surviving and
proliferating and spreading their species
[SPEAKER_00]: across the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ways they do this is they
actually use animals and they use us as
[SPEAKER_00]: humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: If plants can express themselves in ways
that are desirable to us, you look pretty,
[SPEAKER_00]: you smell good, you fulfill some sort of
medicinal need, you ease an ailment in my
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all ways that plants please us
and what does that lead to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it leads to us proliferating those
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're sending your rare seeds
to your buddy in Europe and this plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: now spreading across the globe because it
was able to please you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all plants like a lot of the ones
that we grow, that's all they want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: is please our desires, fulfill our
desires.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get into gardening, the first goal
is to just keep our plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to see this plant to the end of
its life cycle and make sure it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once we get adept, we reach the end
game, which is basically hunting through
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants, becoming willing victims of
the botany of desire and finding the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: that please us the most, finding the ones
that are most desirable and then usually
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferating those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the cycle and if you think about
it from that meta perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really trippy, it's really bizarre.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will probably toil for the rest of my
life until I die looking through these
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of you could go through your
seed collection and you couldn't get to
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them before you died.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to spend the rest of your
life looking through these seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: finding the ones that are most desirable
for you and then spreading them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the end game of this
cultivation thing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you get good at the actual
practice and then what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to cross some of your own
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take those two pepper plants
that are your favorite and bang them
[SPEAKER_00]: together and make new seeds and share them
with your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even send them to another country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, what other organism is so
smart to please us to the point where we
[SPEAKER_00]: send them across the globe?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many seeds do you need in order for
a phenol hunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of people think that
you need to be actually growing hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: and hundreds of plants in order to do a
true phenol hunt, which just isn't true.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your opinion, how many seeds should you
be kind of hunting through in order to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to find what you're looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets brought up all the time and my
view personally is a little more home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower empowering and small cultivator
empowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, how many do you need to
constitute an actual phenol hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are answers in academia and
there are specific ones, but I broke it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the idea of hunting a phenotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really any time you pop a seed,
you're hunting a phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to say like, okay, what
constitutes a hunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe two, like all the way down to two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can compare them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even just one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Popping one seed should be considered a
phenol hunt in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, in academia, the number is
16.
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 seeds will give you a representation of
this cultivar and that has to do with math
[SPEAKER_00]: and Punnett squares, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How they break down these different
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you can remember from biology
class, they make these predictability
[SPEAKER_00]: squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allow you to track genetic attributes
and how often they pass down and how
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all come in fours and four times
four is 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So academia says 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing 30 because it's what I can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say run what you can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as seeing what a plant is capable
of, I like a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's a good way to see a
lot of what the seed has to offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't let anyone tell you that you're
not a phenol hunter because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: popping enough seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only disempowering view that I
stand against.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I think there's a lot of that
being thrown around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just popping a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not a phenol hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in any of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're hunting genetic traits,
you are a phenol hunter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my view is very empowering in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not to get too far off track, but I do
want to add you brought up pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: chucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are against pollen
chucking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're completely fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, listen, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's everybody has their own values
and principles, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, if you breed something,
you are a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I, I know that there's a
difference between just putting two things
[SPEAKER_00]: together and then actually doing like a
full IBL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that those are differences,
but the word breeder to me means one who
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't tell you some of the best
genetics I've ever gotten were just a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: in his basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had two strains that he liked and he
put them together and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an amazing cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's going, yeah, but I'm not a real
breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to see that type of limiting
belief.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference between what you
made in your garden than the guy who did a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred plant phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yours is just a smaller selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to empower people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding is easy and fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everyone should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my, that's my view.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say that I did a podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several years ago now with Vader OG,
ocean grown genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I had mentioned to him,
they have, you know, I did my first cross
[SPEAKER_01]: I crossed, but I don't really consider
myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just did this one cross and
he's like, no, you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You did a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: You crossed a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, he took pollen of one plant,
pollinate a female and made seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just mirrored exactly what he had
mentioned in that talk.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to look at my principles and
values as, okay, well, what's the result?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the result is telling people,
Hey, it is easy showing people how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it and saying, you are a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means more medicine, more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're there gatekeeping and putting
people down and calling people names
[SPEAKER_00]: because they didn't do it the way you do
it, that's just going to result in less
[SPEAKER_00]: people growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the definition of gatekeeping in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't, obviously I don't condone
people like releasing unstable genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the gene pool and not telling people,
but that's not usually what's happening,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually you've got really desirable
cultivars being crossed to really
[SPEAKER_00]: desirable cultivars and a lot of fun stuff
coming out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I like to see is as many
people doing it as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back to phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you phenol hunting male plants,
female plants or both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I have a few goals with this phenol
hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is to just find plants that do
well on Molokai.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of environmental pressures
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want to plant that'll survive
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, from there,
I hope to find something really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we've got some heavy winds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the nature of recording outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to find something really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would take a male, I would take a
female and, and the idea is to get it back
[SPEAKER_00]: to our head breeder, Rhizo rich,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's been working on some incredible
stuff and I would love to see something,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, go back to him, but every phenol hunt
is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to encourage people to base
your phenol hunting and your gardening in
[SPEAKER_00]: general around a mission, around a mission
or an idea or, or, you know, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can work towards, because if you
have a goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see a certain profile that
you feel like is dead and resurrected,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a beautiful mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a certain plant
that's going to help you with your medical
[SPEAKER_00]: issues and ease some of your ailments,
that is a beautiful, beautiful mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to determine just about
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your guiding star.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, what you're aiming at on the flip
side of that coin is you kind of have to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with what you're given.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I really, really want a good male,
but I pop a bunch and there's just nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: that's that desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I want to do is select a
subpar male because I wanted a male and
[SPEAKER_00]: then go forward with that project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be wowed and impressed and
spoken to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the only hard and fast
recommendations and rules that I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: for a phenol hunter is don't kid yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to find plants that speak to you,
that wow you, that knock your socks off.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you want to go forward with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not exactly what you were
originally planning, sometimes you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: call an audible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you got to change up the game
plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the reasons I really like
the work that Rich does because he will
[SPEAKER_00]: never sacrifice quality and impressiveness
to fulfill a goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, I do like to have
goals in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this one, I want to find one
that's going to do well in the wet season,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to not succumb to powdery
mildew and bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to find one that's going to also do
well for the rest of the year here and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we can incorporate that in the
work we're doing, that's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, that's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have low expectations for this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying not to get my plants
covered in powdery mildew and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bud worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to have like a clear
mind on what you're looking for when you
[SPEAKER_01]: begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like now you mentioned that it's
a little bit different there in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming you've done phenohunts in
other areas we lived before.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the big difference there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips for folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause really we got people from all over
the world tuning in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything specific area wise that
people need to know when they're doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is why it's so important to
phenohunt, especially for outdoor growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you are, you are basically going
to succumb to the environment to some
[SPEAKER_00]: degree, and you need to have plants that
do well in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same as growing an attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done little phenohunts popping packs
of seeds in my five by five and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, or back when I was in Humboldt
popping seeds here or there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is different because it's an
outdoor in bed living soil grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, luckily I've connected with a guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a, he's a guest on my show,
Malachi Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing it for 11 years out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really beneficial because again,
the reason why you need to phenohunt and
[SPEAKER_00]: find stuff that works in your environment
is your environment is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your environment is unique and there are
lots of cultivars that aren't going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: well in certain conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to look through the genetic
gene pool and find what thrives in your
[SPEAKER_00]: locale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have to deal with really
specific stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now it's the wet season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's extremely humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool out, but it's, I mean,
it's super wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't even want to have mulch on
your living soil beds wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's standing water, you know,
it'll turn to soup if you, if there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy rain and you water it and there's
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we want cultivars that are
mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want cultivars that will thrive well in
high humidity that can deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these are all really specific
attributes that are basically just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, weed out the weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the strong will survive, but
everybody's environment is completely
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's garden is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you need to be hunting for
your space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I will say one thing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the word resistant probably gets
thrown out a lot when you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: people working in their environments and
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll say, Hey, I am in a humid
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran a bunch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five of them got powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: One did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore this one is a mold resistant
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be pretty, I would be reticent to
say something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I will say is it works well here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It resisted this species of mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It survived and thrived during,
during these stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Saying something is pest resistant or
mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always a little bit hesitant to say
too many times have I seen those claims
[SPEAKER_00]: then prove out to be wrong in a different
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is 100% true is you can find a
cultivar that does well in your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment with your stressors and then
keep that over time and keep it there and
[SPEAKER_00]: give it out to local growers, especially
important with the outdoor growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wondered like when they say,
Oh, it's resistance to powdery mildew or
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance to pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, how do you prove that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't anybody just say, Oh yeah,
this is resistant to powdery mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't there like, is there any testing
that can be done to like prove that in the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics it is resistant or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in coffee, I like to work in coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my other big medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love all plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in coffee, they have to have strict
guidelines to say something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to do a double blind controlled
study with a, with a coffee Institute at
[SPEAKER_00]: Vanderbilt university or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like I said, it's a control.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have these large scale grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so it's not just a small sample size.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them, they will introduce the
coffee borer beetle or they will
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced coffee rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to get, you have to get white
papers published and peer reviewed on this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff before you can go out there and say,
Hey, here's a mold resistant coffee
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't really exist in our world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on the medicinal side of things,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Virtually non-existent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do like to see people doing like
smaller controlled studies of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people who do release some
pests into their garden and document it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally that's just not happening,
you know, outside of big, big crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and like I said, universities usually
conducting a lot of these studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee university of Brazil, uh,
again, Vanderbilt university study,
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee science studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, these are the places that like do
those types of testing and will actually
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a white paper that says,
congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have found a mold resistant cultivar
doesn't really exist in other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said you, uh, current phenol hunt
is 30 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're outdoors in a living soil bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for like organic inputs
throughout the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is an interesting one here on
the islands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's made me rethink about a lot of
things really, but here we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: access to a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm used to Amazon being my best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: AC infinity.com hit up rootedleaf.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're we're rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon takes like three, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get anything here, you know,
Walmart and target is faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on Walmart garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the AC infinity tents,
but, but Amazon takes a long time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so basically you have to use what you
have around you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works well with all our style of
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grow it is everybody on the island who
grows grows sustainably, not just because
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic scene is big here,
but because you have to, you have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you want nitrogen, the easiest way to
get it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make some fish aminos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to get kelp is to go
harvest kelp out of the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco coir is all over the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you throw those coconut husks right
into a chipper and it comes out like
[SPEAKER_00]: fluffy gold, like pillows of gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really interesting how
there's so much closed loop farming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: necessity here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be employing a lot of
those practices on this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I did sneak some secret
weapons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got my rooted leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some things that I know are going
to be, are going to be beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: but mostly listen, I'm not looking to
reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to the 11 plus year growers who
have been doing it here and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I say let's interplant some
basil in this bed and they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, but that's going to attract spit
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I go, what the H are spit bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they explained to me, there's this bug
on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were just about to attract them into
your garden and ruin everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you didn't know because you haven't
been growing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not looking to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm following these guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Malachi is historically the grower island.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see all the growers when you fly
in, if you fly in at a night flight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see all the flood lights in the
backyards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to keep their plants awake at
night because the light cycles here are
[SPEAKER_00]: different and has a rich history of
growing here and specifically sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a bio waste, a green waste
remediated medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that uses cinder, local cinder as the
aeration and, uh, you know, they make
[SPEAKER_00]: their own microbes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make bam, beneficial anaerobic
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just doing it local.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sustainability by the way,
just cause you're a soil grower doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you shouldn't take a look at your
sustainability and say, how can I close
[SPEAKER_00]: these loops?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely been guilty of that before
and grow how you're going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to grow sustainably,
it's about closing that loop more than
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that's a good end goal
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely helps the environment
eco-friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, can you do a phenol hunt in multiple
mediums?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, could you do like a
hydroponics, have some plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics and some plants in living
soil, and then do a phenol hunt that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also two part question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any benefit to just doing a
phenol hunt in hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have that more precision control over
the inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people ask about like how to grow
during a phenol hunt, I always say grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that you know how to grow,
grow the way that you can grow them
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and see their full potential
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's kind of two sides to that coin,
which is you want to grow them well so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see how well they express themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you also want to see what they do when
things aren't perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be very, very telling and
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, there are benefits to growing in a
hydro setup where you can really fine tune
[SPEAKER_00]: and test those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's what you're looking to do,
get data like that, that's one of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always say do what works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever medium you're currently doing
well in, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some benefits to small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to move things around,
remove things, over water things easily,
[SPEAKER_00]: under water things easily, keep everything
in a separate container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, a root borne pathogen
doesn't cause problems for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely benefits to using
small pot sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point of all this is you're
basically just growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know how to grow and you can grow
well, do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real difference is you're
basically just looking for expressions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes, yeah, we also need a yield
because it's our personal medicine and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's going to be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mostly you just need these plants to
be big enough to show them your structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need them to flower enough to get
their profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to carry necessarily these
plants all the way through like you
[SPEAKER_00]: normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to see what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take notes, take clones, and then collect
that data and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever that looks like to you,
I wouldn't necessarily recommend switching
[SPEAKER_00]: setups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there are benefits to certain
styles of growing and specifically certain
[SPEAKER_00]: container sizes when pheno hunting helps
keep the plant small, be able to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: things and rearrange things so you can
take close looks at things instead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the one in the back corner looks
real good, but I can't really get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are benefits, but do what works
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm all about recommending what
works for your current setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as characteristics to look
for, there are so many different things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can look for, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anything from tricone production
to structure to color, it goes on and on
[SPEAKER_01]: and on effects, you know, after it's
harvested and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What characteristics do you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is again, largely determined by your
goals, obviously, but there's a whole list
[SPEAKER_00]: of, like you said, the obvious ones,
scent, frost coverage, yield, structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are things that we all look for and
admire and just kind of add up to things
[SPEAKER_00]: we like, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you have a very specific mission,
then you know what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want that profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to hunt that profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may even put up with some weakness in
order to get that profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's goal driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I do like to look for
certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ease of growth, ease of growth,
meaning largely to do with feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: even green leaves with whatever I'm
feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe I stress it a little bit
and it doesn't miss a beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ease of growth is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how a plant feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want tough cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I want to say resistant,
but things that hold up to stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're going to have stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to introduce this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to see how they hold up against
those problems and how well they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting even more specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to, you know what I like to see on
a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what I'm hunting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if it's a certain profile or
if I want to mail or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see botanical compounds showing
early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see early frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see week two, start to see
things that you don't normally see until
[SPEAKER_00]: later in the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that's almost a sure
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: A low leaf to flower ratio or leaf to
fruit ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another big one where if I'm going
to be, if I'm going to have to manicure
[SPEAKER_00]: this thing after I harvest it,
I want to be doing one or two clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always super, super attractive to
me and internotal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Internotal spacing does not get enough
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like getting the right distance
between the nodes and then also ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: are resistant to those changing due to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe if you're a beginner grower,
this will be a good tip for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hotter environments will increase your
internotal spacing length.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stretches plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Colder temperatures cause plants to huddle
up and stay bushy, but there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars I've noticed that kind of
maintain their internotal spacing
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always very attractive to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice big towering plants that grow
outwards in a nice canopy and a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: internotal spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the very specific things that I
love to see, but largely it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on your goals and what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you never can go wrong with a
good structure and ease of growth and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are probably my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the old stem rub technique where
you're rubbing the stem on your fingers
[SPEAKER_01]: and then smelling it and then kind of
comparing the smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a stem rubbing fool, Mr. Growett.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a stem sniffing MFer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem rubs are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually given a lot of thought to
this because we do our Q&A streams for the
[SPEAKER_00]: members and sometimes they ask really good
questions like, I'm getting this profile
[SPEAKER_00]: off my stem rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I expect it?
[SPEAKER_00]: In flower and like I said, I've done a lot
of stem rub in my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not, I'm no scientist, but I've
sniffed a lot of stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can unequivocally tell you that
sniffing the stem and seeing that profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like less than 50% of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like way less than 50% of the time
you actually smell that smell the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: way through until the finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually your stem rub is going to smell a
little bit different than your flowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: week four and usually your flowers in week
four, I would say about half the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe more, they change until harvest and
then you cure it and it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think it's a great indicator of
what profile the plant is going to give
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly wouldn't ever like cull a
plant because of early indicators like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I also feel like super
unscientific, super Jordan Rivers opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also feel like it's a pretty good
indication of loudness overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, the smell itself, the type of
smell may change, but if I'm smelling a
[SPEAKER_00]: stinky, stinky stem in week three of veg,
I feel like generally that translates to
[SPEAKER_00]: stinky, stinky flowers later in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just the overall powerfulness of the
scent, you know, the power of the scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a pretty good indicator
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rarely do I see, oh, whoa, this stem
stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's just kind of black terpenes
in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That usually doesn't, doesn't track with
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those are super unscientific
observations, but I, yes, I love stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stem rubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stem sniffing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's a great indicator of
the way the plant will smell as it
[SPEAKER_00]: matures, but I do think it's a pretty good
indicator of if it's going to stink or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That does make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people are completely against
it for kind of the reason you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: how like the profile changes throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a, that's a really good call out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you do stress, although it's kind
of automatically done stress kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: happens throughout the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't really need to do anything
specific, but other people are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: precision stress techniques while phenol
hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of those precision stress
techniques can be done in order to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt through phenos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I feel like there's two types
of phenol hunts just classified in my
[SPEAKER_00]: brain, Jordan River categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like the first one is coddling
phenol hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is typically what I like to do,
which is you try to keep your plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have as few speed bumps as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will show you what your plant can
do at its fullest potential, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll, it'll show you what it's capable of
if you grow it really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other side of that is what I
like to call the hell run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how a lot of people phenol
hunt, which is like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to underwater this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see the ones that do well when
things aren't going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really beneficial too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I like to do one after another
ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it just happens if I run
a plant, but ideally I like to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to its fullest potential and see
what it's capable of, see that I like it,
[SPEAKER_00]: see that it wows me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can go back the second time and
do some of those stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest ones are to expose it to high
heat, expose it to cold, um, see how it
[SPEAKER_00]: does under too little light saturated with
a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really, really easy things to
test overwatering, underwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets a little bit crazier when people
actually introduce pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insects or a pathogen or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who do that, I really do have
respect for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say specifically when I was
talking about like testing and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and official testing, I don't want to
put down the people who are doing small
[SPEAKER_00]: controls because that's what it's,
that's the best we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those people are doing God's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to the level of, of like some
university would, would be able to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I love the people who do introduce
pests to their small scale grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: document the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really, really cool and very good
work, but two different types of phenol
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts, both are extremely beneficial and
both are necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say to really understand a cultivar,
both seeing what it can do under the right
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and then how it responds to,
you know, um, nonoptimal conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are both very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the two types of phenol
hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'd say about training the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some folks who do phenol hunts,
they say, grow the plant naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see what the natural structure is
and then make the decision from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other folks do training on the plants,
you know, the low stress train topping any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of high stress training techniques,
whether it be, you know, like super
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping, for example, they do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have a feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what your answer is going to be is
do what you want to do as a phenol hunter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what route you want
to go in regards to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, as a phenol hunter, what do you
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you let your plants grow naturally or
do you do some form of training?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do what I normally do in my
garden, but also what I think most people
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to turn this around on you,
Mr. Growett.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think most people top their plants
as a form of training?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of new folks don't because
they don't want to mess with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they just want to grow the
plant and let's see how it is right off
[SPEAKER_01]: the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think as they're a grower too in,
they will, because they can see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can, you know, learn how to do it,
see what the benefits are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people need to control height in
their grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll top some, some people do it in
order to kind of help with the training,
[SPEAKER_01]: make the plant wider, have those lower
branches kind of grow out and make a wider
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, for the most part, I feel like new
growers probably just let the plant grow
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other folks I think a majority of people
do do some form of training, whether it be
[SPEAKER_01]: topping, super cropping or low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the majority are those who,
like you said, are new and aren't training
[SPEAKER_00]: or those who are training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say of those who are,
topping is probably the most common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe people can let me know in chat,
a shout out to the, to the Fimmers out
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, make your voices heard in
the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I feel like topping is pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like it is a good idea to do at
least one high stress training event
[SPEAKER_00]: during your phenome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, everybody grows different,
do what you're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a low stress training master and
you want to bend or over and do all the
[SPEAKER_00]: tying up and fun stuff, you do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do you buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to see one or two high stress
training events because sometimes plants
[SPEAKER_00]: don't respond super, super well to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's good to know if your cultivar is
one of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other ones, I feel like you top them and
they just like, they take it as a personal
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge and the next day they're just
exploding with growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another trait that I love to see
responds well to topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I think that's beneficial
because I would say that most plant
[SPEAKER_00]: trainers top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, your audience is going to have to
correct me if I'm wrong on that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I feel like most plant trainers top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so simple to teach someone go in
there, snip here, look at the nodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: do it right at the top, multiply the
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like a good topping man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simple, quick, effective, but it all
depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some, I know some people,
shout out to monster Scrogg and TK Geico.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a member.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people that Fim and Scrog a
masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could never advise against that,
but I do like to see high stress training,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a topping during a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just see what the plant does when you cut
it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as you're growing these plants,
some folks will be killing off plants as
[SPEAKER_01]: they go through the grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They may see something in the seedling
stage as early as the seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they see funky growth to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to keep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they kill it off or in the vegetation
stage, maybe they're seeing something that
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't like with the morphology of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're killing it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you the type that kills off plants
throughout the grow or are you a phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunter where you're letting everything
grow, no matter what it looks like all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up until harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to cull early and often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're looking for a plant that
checks all the boxes, you have to cull
[SPEAKER_00]: early and often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if your mission
dictates that you look through some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these finnaker seeds, then so be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're after that elusive,
you know, lime smell or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may tolerate weakness to see this
plant through to see if it's the one
[SPEAKER_00]: you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I think that people generally
are too slow to cull.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's so many seeds out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, there's so many good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many wonderful types of plants
you can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if this thing is, if this thing is
giving you any trouble, my recommendation
[SPEAKER_00]: would be to cull earlier, cull more often
and send more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot to look through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I think people are
generally a little too afraid to cull too
[SPEAKER_00]: early.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a plant that checks
all the boxes, you should be culling
[SPEAKER_00]: basically from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the flip side of that, you really can't
tell how a plant is gonna express until
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all the way done.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my members asked me a new type
question that's like such a good question,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is how can you tell when a plant's
like final profile is there?
[SPEAKER_00]: At what stage can you tell what a plant's
final profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, harvest, cure, four weeks into
cure maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep it around to really see
what it's gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, if you're looking for something
that's gonna be the one and it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: check all the boxes, start culling early
and start culling often.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only exception to that is if you're
looking for a specific medicinal effect or
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific profile that you're willing to
put up with some finnickiness to get
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be my answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then at what point do you select
a keeper, Fino?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you select just one or has there ever
been a time where you had to select
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple keepers because you just liked
more than one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, always, always.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there's like a few ways to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people find a strain that works for
them and they have their keeper and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they start working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find their cultivar and they'll
make more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll work the generations further.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people keep kind of a stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm one of those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is probably the most common
when it comes to cultivators and home
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators where they get a list of
keepers and they keep a handful around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what'll happen is sometimes a new
one will pop up that's better than one in
[SPEAKER_00]: your stable and you'll kind of swap that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, 2023, I had a handful of
keepers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some rise of rich work that was
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some purple caper work that was really,
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another that a member made, a peach dosi
by a guy named Old Bay, is there's just
[SPEAKER_00]: some really, really good keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of created my stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you're at that stage, I really
recommend you share the love and spread
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to either make seeds or spread
cuttings around because the last thing you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do is hunt for years and years and
years and find your unicorn and find the
[SPEAKER_00]: one that helps you, helps your crones or
helps your migraines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it dies in your garden and it's
gone forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot let that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the only scenario that's a failure
in this whole botany of desire phenohunt
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that you remedy that is by
backing up those genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way is to just give it to your
buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are tissue culture ways to store
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the easiest way to do it is just pass
the cuts around, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Share the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if it helps other people with your
same ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all biologically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got the real panacea cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to lose that to a power
outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to lose that to a soil-borne
pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spread that love.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, for me, it's like I keep a
stable of keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people keep no cuts and they just
want to look through as many seeds as they
[SPEAKER_00]: can and paw through the library and see as
much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a beautiful mission in
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I'm hunting for something so I
can keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep a handful of things
because I like variety and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread those cuttings around so I don't
lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's several grommies who are
holding on to those cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't got to worry when I'm out here
in the islands that I'm going to lose all
[SPEAKER_00]: that hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I recommend is do that
hunt, get your keeper, get your stable,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then spread the love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give those cuttings out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the smartest thing you will ever
have done when something goes wrong in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Losing Fino, the feeling of heartbreak
that happens once you lose that Fino that
[SPEAKER_01]: you just love so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spent so many years just popping
seeds, growing plants out, finding really
[SPEAKER_01]: good ones, and then not like monster
cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least you can bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if the plants in the flowering
stage shows in the flower, you can cut off
[SPEAKER_01]: a limb and put it right into soil and
it'll root again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can keep those genetics around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made the mistake of not keeping a
handful of good Finos around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a personal story here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me the top regret.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Queen Anne's Revenge by TGA Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, formerly it was TGA Genetics back
when I grew it and went to Subcool Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Ms. Jill took it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk about it so much on my channel that
people are probably sick of hearing the
[SPEAKER_01]: story behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just beautiful plant,
easy feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had covered in trichomes from top to
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower buds were super dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like no larp on it whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Towards the end of flowering, the purpling
that happened, it was like a dark,
[SPEAKER_01]: dark purple that started at the top,
slowly worked its way down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant as the days went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I ended up doing a partial
harvest on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I harvested the top branches and
uncovered some of the other leaves which
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't exposed to the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, so like a green color
and the purple with the green,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of looked like more like a neon
green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looked amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, the effects, the effects
on that were just incredible narcotic
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up picking up a 10 pack of Queen
Anne's Revenge six months ago and I grew
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for that Fido again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I circled back around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't found it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything close?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to keep hunting for it
because I need to find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many heartbreaking stories like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, it's surprising how
much of a reaction you'll have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's a really sad event.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that thing's gone forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It bums you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, I had a Katura Kush by
Cultivated Choice that was just straight
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just face full of coffee beans and I love
coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably one of my biggest sad
moments is losing that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out Queen Anne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out the old school NorCal boys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool RIP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool that you found that
cultivar and that it was so amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I can find it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, again, Monster Crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually found a Icarus Wings by Prism
Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had it flowering and I'm like,
I need to keep this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I want this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went ahead and Monster Cropped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm keeping that around and I'll
probably use it for a breeding project
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm just so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, back on topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're coming up towards the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to ask you if you have any other
tips on how to conduct a successful and
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get started now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let anyone put you down or tell you
you can't do it or that you're not a
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not this or you're not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you just said, basically,
stay organized and stay on top of things
[SPEAKER_00]: and take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have cuttings of everything
you're hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it means taking and revegging
something, you're going to you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: try one five weeks into cure and go,
holy crap, I should have taken that cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the last thing you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take cuttings of everything,
back up everything, share everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most importantly, take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain will trick you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your brain will let nostalgia and emotions
come into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So find out what works for you,
whether that's doing it electronically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go through and control F and
search through things and scroll,
[SPEAKER_00]: scroll, scroll, or doing it old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the whiteboard up on the grow room
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take all of your extensive
notes and then maybe snap a picture of it
[SPEAKER_00]: before you start over old school,
you know, pen and paper, find what works
[SPEAKER_00]: for you and take extensive notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the only big difference
between doing a grow and doing a phenol is
[SPEAKER_00]: just popping a lot of something or a lot
of different things, taking notes on
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and taking cuttings so you can
run them again later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that is my advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your own palette makes you unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one else with your tastes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why your selections are going to
be unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, just don't let anyone put down
you or your work or what you plan on
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a mission in mind and head towards it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember that at the end of the day,
we're all just willing victims of the
[SPEAKER_00]: botany of desire, growing these plants,
proliferating these plants, doing their
[SPEAKER_00]: bidding essentially, so that maybe they
can please us with a new pretty color or a
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating new aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're here for it and start phenol
hunting today.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my last tip is just start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got so many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got seeds piled up,
listener.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pop them, pop 10 of them, pop 100 of
them and God bless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the listeners how they can find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, grow cast podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just tune into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on Spotify.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at growcastpodcast.com, all the
apps, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just listen to the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my only real big call to action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we do have grow cast seed co.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to take a look at the amazing
genetics by rise a rich, uh, we got the
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie truffle shuffle shuffle up there is
doing amazing is doing amazing in this
[SPEAKER_00]: sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we do have some chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG just, uh, over there off camera as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're rooting for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are rooting for this chill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: OG in this race, but we'll see what ends
up happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow cast podcast.com there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as events, we got a
cultivators cup in Rockford, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_00]: April 13th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go ahead and message me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of invite only, but you can
message me a grow cast on Instagram or the
[SPEAKER_00]: website, growcastpodcast.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's April 13th in Rockford,
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a Pestapalooza with sync angel
Matthew Gates coming up in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a riso rich breeder class in
Buffalo and Toronto.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll all be later this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow grow cast to stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot you had those chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you end up growing them out there,
I I'm really interested to see what you
[SPEAKER_01]: get for result.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're in a completely different
climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I'm growing indoors and I'm
controlling my environment and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but different genetics can react
differently, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different expression in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody could grow and they could be
like, this is hot trash in one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, this is fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm interested to hear how it,
how it works out for you in your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's the opposite environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Molokai Kevin said that OGs do okay
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: OGs, when I used to grow SFV, it was a
little bit finicky, but it never got
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said they do okay out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll be rooting for the chill out OG
to be a front runner in the pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely keep me updated on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the folks listening in,
if you have any questions, questions on
[SPEAKER_01]: pheno hunting, please drop it down in the
comment section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have other people who have talked about
pheno hunting on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dig back on some of the episodes
you'll see, but there's definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: different opinions, different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are interested in learning other
ways to go about it, definitely tune into
[SPEAKER_01]: those other episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do leave those questions in the
comment section, I can potentially use
[SPEAKER_01]: them for future episodes because I
might've missed something might've been
[SPEAKER_01]: something that somebody's listening in and
like, Oh, why didn't he ask this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that down in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, next time around when I have
somebody talking about pheno hunting,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll ask that question for sure.
