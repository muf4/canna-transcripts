[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big believer in making sure your
minerals are up where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we focus a lot on NPK,
but really it's all the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients and minerals that really
make the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're better off just going out and
getting some leaf litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity that's in some leaf litter
from the forest floor is going to far
[SPEAKER_00]: out-compete anything that you're buying
from the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why a lot of people are having
to re-inoculate or even say on the
[SPEAKER_00]: package, you know, you have to do this
every month or every 90 days is because
[SPEAKER_00]: most people are growing in volumes of soil
that are too small to sustain a proper
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to do it in a way that's not
only responsible because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative practice, but in a lot of
ways it's been proven that it is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to produce that type of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with James from Organic
Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to get into large-scale
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this topic has actually been requested
by quite a few people because we haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: really covered it on this podcast yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most episodes really revolve around small
operations such as home grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode, let's focus on your
experience in large-scale operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, what I like to do with all the
guests is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been gardening vegetables for
probably 25 years or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like a science experiment in
elementary school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember what it was, but I had
tomato seeds in a bag and they germinated
[SPEAKER_00]: and sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my teacher was like, you should go
home and plant those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just like sparked a thing where it
was like this amazing cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put a plant in the ground and grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put my first garden in the worst
place possible up against a building that
[SPEAKER_00]: was not facing the South.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was mostly in the shadow the entire
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the years, I kind of just
gradually grew things bigger and started
[SPEAKER_00]: out as a lot of people do, especially back
when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bought Miracle Grow and you use that
to fertilize your garden and thought you
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing amazing, wonderful things
because that's what everybody did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was 18 and I grew some
medicinal plants in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I built a homemade NFT system and grew
plants with good old DynaGrow and
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually used the leftovers in my
outdoor garden because it said I could and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's nutrients, so why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over time, just kind of paying attention
to what was going on around me made these
[SPEAKER_00]: logical leaps to moving away from that
stuff and building compost, really doing
[SPEAKER_00]: like polycropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really just separated plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of started mimicking nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throwing like 20% of my harvest just
right back onto the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally go out there and pick stuff
off the plants and drop it on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of felt like, hey,
this is what's happening naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what should happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my garden just got better and better
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and then eventually in Michigan,
things ended up in a place to where we
[SPEAKER_00]: could grow medicinal plants without the
fear of anyone coming in and getting in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of started looking into,
my intention was to do an NFT system
[SPEAKER_00]: again, but I figured I wanted something a
little faster and I grow my garden outside
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not grow in some soil indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And started Googling you like,
what's the best soil to grow this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And stumbled onto the concept of the soil
food web and Jeff Lowenfels and Lane
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingham and all these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just stumbled into a couple of other
people that kind of sparked the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till thing and really kind of being
more hands-off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all these practices I had been
doing for like the last 20 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea any of the science behind
it, the nomenclature, nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of stumbling into this,
just kind of broadened this whole huge
[SPEAKER_00]: picture for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up in some Facebook
groups and kind of there's a lot of drama
[SPEAKER_00]: in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started my own group, which has kind
of grown, it's like 13,000 people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we focus on regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our first conference on this year
in February in Sturbridge, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've put our second one on this next
February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been kind of a crazy journey
finding natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it led me to my fiance and moving to
California and stumbling into large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plant farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's been quite a change from
growing in a few tents in a basement to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing 18,000 square feet outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: 18,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly how many plants are you growing in
that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are nine light-depth hoops that take
up roughly 9,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of those hoops gets around 300
plants per run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the 2,700 plants, I guess,
in the light depths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the full-term garden,
that kind of varies depending on how early
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we got a much later start
because of weird weather out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have many more plants in the space,
kind of like hedgerows and much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see people walking around with
plants that are at least as tall as them,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any taller than that, it's unmanageable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not want to be getting on a ladder
and dealing with some of the monsters that
[SPEAKER_00]: people grow, which is a nice photo op.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Wendy and I, our next year,
we're going to grow a couple of them just
[SPEAKER_00]: so we can check these monsters out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for management of the canopy,
it's definitely not economical for time at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think a lot more smaller plants
is probably the way to go when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at scale for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine the difficulty, the more
difficult it gets with the bigger plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me, I'm just a small home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm growing mostly indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some outdoor plants,
but mostly indoors, grow tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do keep my plants pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I grow those bigger plants,
what I call big, five, six feet,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's certainly more work involved than it
is smaller plants, two, three feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to imagine the tools and equipment
are a lot different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're outdoors in a large scale
operation, what tools and equipment do you
[SPEAKER_01]: typically use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, honestly, for us,
it's not that much different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly not that much different from
having, I mean, I guess it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about moving from tents
to a big, large scale operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably a lot of it is going to be
a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you've been doing any type of home
vegetable gardening or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do on our farm is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do very minimal tillage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if we have to till,
we will.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are certain situations where that's
a necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly if you're opening up a new field
or something like that, tilling makes
[SPEAKER_00]: sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get some amendments in there, break up the
grass so you can actually plant into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this last year when we had to rip some
ground, rented a tiller.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a tractor that we bought last
year, but we don't have the funds to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: attachments for it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was me walking behind a tiller,
tilling up some ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we try to do that as minimally as
possible and really try to focus on things
[SPEAKER_00]: like cover crops and doing some silage
tarping after knocking down cover crop to
[SPEAKER_00]: break things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year, the way things worked out,
we just were not able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made a decision and it worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It benefited us because we do do a cover
crop so heavily and that ground was cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop through the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we tilled everything in,
there was a lot of biomass and it all just
[SPEAKER_00]: grew back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we basically didn't have to reseed
because we tilled all that in and we were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get some amendments in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that full term garden right now,
you walk out there, there's purse lane
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like a foot and a half high.
[SPEAKER_00]: We literally chopped all that stuff down
and tilled it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes back pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into cover crops first and then
we'll kind of get back into kind of how
[SPEAKER_01]: you prepare the soil for planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I assume that you're doing cover
crops between grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you typically do for cover
crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: So out here, we buy like a fodder seed
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's available locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like some fava beans and some
veg and stuff like that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the cover cropping we do is
really like at the end of cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's companion plants that are
out there along with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get technical about what
you're calling, you know, each thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the year, we will plant
different things and what we're companion
[SPEAKER_00]: planting with everything I just described,
like the purse lane, those are companion
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our covers depend on the
situation and we'll use different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my, this will be my second winter
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my goal is to really try to put out
some different cover crops than were last
[SPEAKER_00]: year, which was kind of like a variety
depending on what the soil test reads.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we may change up what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're talking about planting for
making our own cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want mulch next year because we
weren't able to get any mulch this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was contracted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some considerations that
we're trying to make outside of just
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional, but how much biomass is
created by whatever we're planting out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we got a fair amount of ground we
need to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't necessarily want to do it
with native grasses that seed really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't want to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in between grows, we basically just
follow everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We let it go, let the plants ride out the
winter, come back, knock everything down,
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get some tarps on it, let the sun
bake everything and come back and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: literally just stick your hand in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we weren't able to do that
this year with the amount of rain that we
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does it take after you,
you knock down the cover crop and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying you're putting like a tarp over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long until you actually take that off
and then start planting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: A few weeks, depending on the weather and
how much sun there is, it can be a few
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got out to our planting started so late
in the season that we had plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the weather was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we just honestly got out
there a little late this year and weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: able to, to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ideally, given the amount of old light
depth tarps that we have on hand,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it just makes sense to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly over, you know, using,
you know, tilling every year or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really does destroy your, the micro
life in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so we try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you remove those tarps,
are you doing anything to prepare the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: for planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people add in amendments,
for example, some people will inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: with microbes, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any sort of preparation
prior to planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year, what we did, ideally you'd
want to get a soil test to kind of gauge
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We weren't, we did not do that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what we did is we,
each bed got some rock dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got some organic chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got some, some lime and some alfalfa
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do do amendments between cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big believer in making sure your
minerals are up where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we focus a lot on NPK,
but really it's, it's all the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients and minerals that really
make the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a big believer and get some rock
dust out there every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you can do, you know, a larger
application of rock dust, less times,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how much you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do an application of rock dust
like once every 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as inoculations in my home grows,
I was doing all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing compost teas and playing with
IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the beginning was really heavy
handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of us, when we get into
growing, it's like, we want to play with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and it's such a responsive
plant that, you know, it, it's satisfying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can see changes when you're,
when you're playing with things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The danger with that is even if you have a
fair understanding of what you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is being heavy handed and you can
throw things out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I was doing teas like every
week and I know people do do teas every
[SPEAKER_00]: week for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was adding too much to my teas and then
throwing things out of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of kind of be careful what
you're, when you're going and getting
[SPEAKER_00]: information online, who you're getting it
from and kind of parse that with some
[SPEAKER_00]: common sense and understand that the
system itself works pretty well on its
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out on the farm, the inoculations that get
done are IMOs and IMO hasn't been done for
[SPEAKER_00]: the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plan is to do one for this next
season, but essentially we're going out
[SPEAKER_00]: and collecting indigenous microorganisms
from different biomes essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then propagating them out on piles of
carbohydrates and carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, it is a, you know, it's a
selection for bacterial or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: for terrestrial yeast and fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be some different bacterias
in there, but essentially the way it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done is it, you know, it's just a great
collection of microbes that you can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: to your farm for very little money,
as opposed to buying an inoculum from the
[SPEAKER_00]: store, which, you know, they're usually,
you know, it's four or five species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not saying it can't help you
certainly in an indoor grow and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sterile soil or dirt, essentially,
you know, those inoculums can help you
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely, but you're better off many
times just going out and getting some leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: litter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity that's in some leaf litter
from the forest floor is going to far out
[SPEAKER_00]: compete anything that you're buying from
the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping in mind and having an
understanding that you're also bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: other things into an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a complete soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have things run out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people like seeing roly polies in
their, their grow because they,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, bind up heavy metals and, you know,
they eat detritus.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is they, they explode out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of, um, living soil growers are
now having problems with roly polies and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing, uh, leaf litter into your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, while it's can be a great idea,
can also cause you some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these things, you kind of need
to understand that there's a balance here
[SPEAKER_00]: and, um, indoor and outdoor, like in my
indoor, I always, had a low level thrips
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, about six months in, I had thrips
enter my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply some beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some sprays here and there,
but I had a clover cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love that stuff and they live
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They live in the plant tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very hard to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I just kind of dealt with them and
survived with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, outdoors, you know, on the farm and
even in my vegetable grow, I just let
[SPEAKER_00]: pests go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, if I saw a pest enter the
garden, they weren't there very long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, had aphids come and attack my milkweed
every year, uh, in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a week or two, they were gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never became a problem because I had
a diverse, uh, population of plants on my
[SPEAKER_00]: property and kept everything pretty
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I wasn't spraying a bunch of stuff
on it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned balance a few different
times and I want to kind of focus in on
[SPEAKER_01]: this for a little bit, specifically the
balance of, of nutrition in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned that you're, you're
typically doing a soil test and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're finding the balances off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're amending in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of folks that grow
organic or no-till regenerative and they
[SPEAKER_01]: hear that the plant uptakes nutrients as
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a common misconception that
things can't get out of balance because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about like how
important it is to stay in balance and
[SPEAKER_01]: what damage can actually be done if you're
out of balance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will say all of this with the caveat
that I'm not a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I count myself as someone who's very
good at collecting people who are wildly
[SPEAKER_00]: more intelligent than I am and know,
um, a lot more about this stuff than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they helped me run my group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I defer to them on a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say that in my experience,
um, depending on the size of your,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, vesicle that you're growing in,
uh, much like a fish tank, it has more
[SPEAKER_00]: buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more room for error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can throw a lot of things at it for
much longer without throwing it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think, again, for me, I think if you
start off with a base, if you have a,
[SPEAKER_00]: an understanding of, um, how the different
nutrients work together and I don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great understanding of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, soil science is extremely complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reading books all the time when I have
the time, but, um, there's a lot of nuance
[SPEAKER_00]: in this and the science is just barely
being scratched at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say that, you know,
there are some important things we
[SPEAKER_00]: understand about, um, mineral balance and
how cations work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and if you have certain things super
out of balance, then nutrients won't
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, there's part of the problem is we
look at this as a chemistry thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, nutrients in a
certain pH are available and that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, the biology is so
important in all of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think really, if you create a
environment that's hospitable to a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: a diverse biology, um, and you don't mess
with them too much, they can balance a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but again, you know, if you're,
I think a lot of problems come with people
[SPEAKER_00]: think they're growing organically and
they're using bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a lot of soluble, uh,
nutrients in those bottles and that can
[SPEAKER_00]: throw things off of balance, um,
a lot faster than if you're overdoing it
[SPEAKER_00]: on some dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's a little bit harder to
overdo it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but people do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, for me, I started out
with like a Klatz Kutz mix with basically
[SPEAKER_00]: with negating the neem meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cause I couldn't get it locally and
people are kind of weird about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just didn't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I've just kind of grew the soil
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think if you really want to look
into like soil science and the numbers and
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing things, um, behind soil testing,
uh, you should look into, um, Dan
[SPEAKER_00]: Kittredge's talks on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, he's actually one of the speakers of
the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's able to break things down in a way
that kids understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, explaining what pH
actually is and how it functions and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it means looking at it as a fuel tank,
as opposed to just a number that makes a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I think looking, the ideas
that he presents are largely from,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, on the soil science aspect,
the testing, uh, John or not John Kemp,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Albrecht.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so there are some specific
numbers, uh, on the mineral side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that have kind of been, uh, collectively
decided upon by Albrecht students.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've kind of all come together and
decide what these optimal numbers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and there, there are some slides on
his talks on YouTube that he kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: lays it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're someone who has a hard time
deep diving into the books, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: that can be kind of long winded and
complicated, there are some, some cheats
[SPEAKER_00]: out there that you can go and find these
people, um, and, and get into that aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of that, um, I think keep it
simple is probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best advice and the best path forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing, um, a worm casting T once
a month, you're probably killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that is a really easy
maintenance thing to do, uh, for your
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor as a maintenance T for,
uh, biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really familiar with those sources
off to check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much good information out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that, uh, when it comes to
soil science, it's so complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just scratching the surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, like there's a lot of
things we do not know about this and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, it's exciting to be the things that
weren't unraveling as we continue to go
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, I'll definitely check out
those sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, uh, let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, from my understanding,
you do use mulch layers, large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can certainly be different than smaller
scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to us about mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my indoor, I grew all kinds of
stuff in my bed and would just smash it
[SPEAKER_00]: down and use it as mulch, you know,
Swiss chard, like just stuff for biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the, on the farm, we try to use,
uh, alfalfa straw as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, like I said, this year we weren't
able to get any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all been contracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, anything that you can get on
your soil to cover it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not bare, uh, is probably a good
thing outside of a bunch of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: grass seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you don't want to deal with later on
down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nature really, you know,
doesn't like bare soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes have a real hard time
existing in an environment that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: being baked by UV rays, um, and dried out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally if soil's not covered up,
it dries out really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we try to add a mulch that has some
nutritional aspect to it, uh, as hence the
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa, uh, but if you don't have that,
even like a third or fourth cutting hay,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, get it on there and cover it
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be doing much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, certainly, you know, if you can't,
uh, you know, use cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the winter or, you know,
for whatever reason, a layer of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, eight to 10 inches of mulch,
you'd be surprised at how much that does,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to improve, um, soil aeration and soil
health over a winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you come back and there's a good
amount of top soil there that's nice and
[SPEAKER_00]: loose and arable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight to 10 inches, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems kind of thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that typical for outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's what we put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we put on our beds,
uh, for our plants on the farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice thick layer of mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, before harvest it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's generally mostly gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just do indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, completely different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, two inches roughly is
what I do, but, uh, maybe I need to
[SPEAKER_01]: thicken it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd probably be beneficial, especially if
I'm using something that's going to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down and be nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, that's why I was going to ask
you how, how long before you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: replenish your mulch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, typically last most of the
grow, you know, I'm in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the desert and so the water
retention in the soil, keeping that top
[SPEAKER_01]: layer moist is difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding in that mulch layers is very
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can last pretty much the entire
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big is your, uh, are you growing in a
pot or a bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, do you have a microscope?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will tell you that the single best
investment in a tool that I ever made,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, for growing was a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we like to think that we're growing in
living soil, uh, in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're doing all of, um,
these practices that really, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: are beneficial to building and maintaining
a living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, when you're in that small
of a volume, um, it's, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: that buffering capacity that we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the ability to sustain
moisture, um, the way that you would like
[SPEAKER_00]: to, and it's just not enough volume for
life to sustain itself in a cycle without
[SPEAKER_00]: you consistent, continually having to add
more life to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you see that, when you buy
something from the store, um, like an
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum, there's two facets to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that it's a lab grown microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're kind of weaker, but they should
propagate and live in an environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and, and keep breeding and living and
reproducing as long as they have food and
[SPEAKER_00]: the conditions are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason why a lot of people are
having to re inoculate or even say in the
[SPEAKER_00]: package, you know, you have to do this
every month or every 90 days, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: is because most people are growing in
volumes of soil that are too small to
[SPEAKER_00]: sustain a proper soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there has, I don't, I'll have to ask,
uh, Wendy what the guy's name was,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there has been, um, some limited
research done that shows at about 60 to 65
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of soil is the minimum you want to
have a self cycling, self sustaining
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're not constantly having to add
things to.
[SPEAKER_00]: My suspicion is that your mulch is lasting
so long because you don't have the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of microbiology that would be sufficient
to actually break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that in turn, you probably,
you would see an increase in your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid and terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got into a larger volume of soil,
because you would have that diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And microbiology, and that would create a
more complex cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the reason why our mulch doesn't last
very long out on the farm is because the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology out there kills it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally lift up clumps of dirt
that have fungi running through them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we have, like I said, we haven't
inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think Wendy's put IMO out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the fourth season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been four years since she's made
an IMO application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, it's an estimate to,
um, you know, the microbes being hardy,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and the environment being such that,
you know, once there's water out there,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they just go off, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's the other thing too,
is, you know, people have this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, not a soil scientist,
but people have this misnomer about,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, microbiology, like dying off when
things get dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure, but they, you know,
mostly they go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it can take a long time for them
to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, outdoors, um, where they,
the biology goes deep, um, the soil can
[SPEAKER_00]: get pretty dry, um, in areas out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we have water out there,
the plants just, they kill it and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see the activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the fungi coming back,
plumping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it never disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of dried out and went
dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, indoors, when your pot dries out and
everything goes dormant, it takes a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time for it to wake up because it's all
gone dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, you're having to
re-inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are all these things that when
you're in a small pot, um, fighting all
[SPEAKER_00]: these forces, um, they stack up and it
makes it harder for you to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, like I said, I think if you get into
a bigger volume and, um, focus on getting,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, more diversity in there, you'll
probably notice your mulch going away
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get a microscope and you scope
your seven gallon pot compared to like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good living soil, I think you're going to
be surprised at how little is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in there because I thought I was
killing it in my bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got a microscope and I was
like, wow, there's almost nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: happening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could see the effects of it starting
to happen in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I still thought I was doing such a
great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so once, and the other aspect of that
is, I don't know if you do teas at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, compost teas, but I was doing compost
teas a lot and just going off of recipes
[SPEAKER_00]: and times, you know, you put this in the
tea and you boil it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you run it for 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, until you have a microscope and you're
actually looking at the tea itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have no idea what you've grown in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you're not going to know all the
names of everything because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you can definitely look in there
and see, you know, do I have bacteria in
[SPEAKER_00]: there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it full of just a bunch of E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coli?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, do I have some higher order
organisms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have I brewed it to a point where it's
nothing but those higher order protozoa
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've consumed all the bacteria and
all the oxygen, depending on the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: tea that you're going for, that might be a
great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your soil is completely dead,
you know, some protozoa, not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and anaerobic tea, it's not the worst
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are anaerobes that live in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there are all these taboo things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to put a super anaerobic
stinky tea on your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, there are some, some words
like anaerobes or people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, it can't be anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't whatever, you know, there are
facultative anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things like, um, lactobacilli,
which, you know, are definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: facultative anaerobes and they're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in your gut.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use them to, to clean with,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time and time again, organic farmers have
mentioned that, uh, should be using a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, some people are trying to,
you know, they're, they're, they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to run organics in three gallons,
five gallons, cause it's easier to move
[SPEAKER_01]: that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, you bring up some fantastic
points and I've heard it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm slowly working towards larger
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only a matter of time before I'm in a
bed running organics and, uh, potentially,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get into the point where I don't
have to till it all, but I'm a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of ways there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, I'll tell you when you make
the switch to your bed, the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: learning curve, uh, if it would tell
everyone this when they're switching to
[SPEAKER_00]: beds is watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be your biggest learning curve is
how to water that bed properly without
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering it or underdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my, my biggest piece of advice to
you is when you build your bed and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting soil in it, water your soil in
layers as you're building it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you make sure your bed is watered
sufficiently from top to bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time you put your soil in there,
because if you fill that with dry soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you start to water that, you will
have hydrophobic pockets in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you are battling forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I can't stress enough,
uh, you know, water that as you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good tip for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking on a large scale, um,
fertilizer, you know, you have the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already mentioned what you do for
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mulch layer, how you prepare the soil to
begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've planted those plants in there and
they start to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point do you fertilize and what do
you use for fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really depends on, you know,
in the outdoor, we're really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping an eye on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when we're able to be out there on a
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this next year, we're trying to
set it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have somebody out there on a more
regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we have five kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't live on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farm is about 45 minutes away from the
homestead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to get out there, it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in an ideal world, we would be
doing a weekly maintenance spray,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, which is a Korean natural farming,
um, concoction of some KNF inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a fermented plant juice,
um, an Oriental or Oriental herbal
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient, which is, um, a tincture with
vodka.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, a brown rice vinegar or a live
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and that's, um, sprayed as like a
weekly maintenance, which is basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: super minor plant food, which has all
different types of micro and macro
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some of the FPJs that we've seen,
um, the, uh, nutrient test results on have
[SPEAKER_00]: been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a wide variation of
nutrients in there, uh, but they're all at
[SPEAKER_00]: various levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every, you know, it's all one to 1000,
one to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the nice thing about all of the KNF
inputs is they're, they're edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take them.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people take them for human
health, but you certainly don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about them hurting you, uh,
because you can eat them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it'd be like a weekly spray of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are some other inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you needed some calcium and some
phosphorus, you could add some Calphos,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is essentially some, some charred
bones that are then soaked in vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really, you know, ideally you have all
of the nutrients and everything you need
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ground, uh, at the beginning of the
year, you've kind of, you've set your,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you filled your fuel tank up
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then we have all of these tools
that we can use to kind of top it off when
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, last year we weren't
able to do anything, uh, as far as KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance sprays really um, at,
at the end of the year, uh, we didn't do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to our full term.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and again, that is a testament to the
microbiology that that is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of people would say the terroir
and I think there probably is something to
[SPEAKER_00]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as the end product goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, so we'd be doing like
maintenance sprays and then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: topping it off with the occasional
addition to those sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we will fertigate with those
same, uh, concoctions, those same inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, all at the same rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just using more of it because
you're soaking it into the ground as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to foliar feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, once we get towards the end of the
cycle, uh, we don't really like spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we move away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then certainly if you're doing
something like a liquid IMO, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO in kind of a compost tea form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you definitely don't want to be
spraying that, uh, on flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, because you can fail microbial testing
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, essentially we're pretty
hands off and, and mostly, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: setting ourselves up at the beginning of
the year, really taking care of the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology, making sure we have,
you know, a diverse set of plants out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always have flowers and different kinds
of wild plants and, you know, given that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, me and my fiance and her,
you know, 70 year old mom, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we were pretty limited on how
much we can be out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the fact that, uh, you know,
the end product consistently won awards
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, you know, people definitely
really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, you know, it works out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm a firm believer of the,
you know, keeping it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of trying to stay hands off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that comes down to,
you know, working in concert with nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that not everything is going
to go your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to control
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the best thing about, uh,
the plant that we're talking about is
[SPEAKER_00]: that, um, it's a gateway plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, everybody wants to grow everything
after they start growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hardly know anyone that started
growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hasn't moved to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it was the reverse for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked growing plants, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's just a really fun plant to
grow and it brings a lot of joy to people
[SPEAKER_00]: and healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's nice to do it in a way that's not
only responsible, uh, because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a regenerative practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, I think it, in a lot of
ways, it's been proven that it is the best
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To produce that type of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're almost entirely doing natural
farming techniques besides that rock
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate, for example, that you mentioned
for the initial amending or the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments that you put in prior to
planting, you're doing natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let me ask you prior to implementing
these natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was your farm using chemicals at all,
or did you always just start with the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Wendy on their farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm trying to think, I think,
you know, back in the day, like a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time ago, uh, when her parents were
growing and she was growing up and that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff, they were definitely,
um, using some, uh, chemical nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think everybody was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will say that when everything went
legal here and everyone was freaking out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, Wendy was confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everyone started failing testing
and she was like, Oh, cause everyone uses
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they don't, um, I think at,
you know, early on they made the switch
[SPEAKER_00]: from anything that was a synthetic
nutrient to organic cause that's how they
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing their food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't make sense to keep doing it
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I know, you know, as far as K and F
that farm has been running, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: K and F inputs for six years now,
uh, where it's, you know, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just, you know, us making inputs and
then applying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you know, as I said before,
when I started out growing, I was
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely using miracle grow and,
um, hydroponic, whatever, uh, that was out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and it, you know, it was a few shops
in Michigan that had that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it wasn't like every corner store
like it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like one spot you had to drive
an hour and a half to and get your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for your tomatoes that you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, do it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I don't fault anyone who's
using that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the thing is a lot of people just
don't have a deeper understanding of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: science because a lot of it's so new and
it is just permeating the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, there are all these new
hot button things that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative and organic and, um,
you know, unfortunately all these labels
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of get co-opted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people, you know, twist things
around and then there ends up being
[SPEAKER_00]: negative connotations to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why I'm trying
to talk to so many people in different
[SPEAKER_00]: camps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the permaculture people don't
necessarily hang out with the biodynamic
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't necessarily hang out with just
the organic dudes who are buying bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: of whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, there's a lot of people that
really believe in, in that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of magic or whatever that they're
buying from the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's the best stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, at large scale,
you, it's, you know, it's far too
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't grow at large scale by buying
bottles of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you right now that,
um, you know, some of the farmers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are, um, you know, hyping these expensive
nutrient lines out there, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're, they're not hyping them because
they're buying them and they work so
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're hyping them because they're paid
money and they were given to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would never buy those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they can't afford them at large
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same reason why nutrient
companies go all around the world and get
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers hooked on fertilizer and teach
them how to grow with their fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically make them indentured
slaves for the rest of their life,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's the only way they know how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have to buy these nutrients from
the companies that have come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the reason why we're trying
to set up our nonprofit is to show people
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can make nutrients from the
things around them in nature, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and, you know, kind of get off that
teat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll tell you that, uh,
people who are fighting really hard in the
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative space and natural farming,
um, you know, those are people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, they're, they're,
they're rebels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, you know, they're, they're the
people on the front line who, when this
[SPEAKER_00]: really starts to threaten, uh,
fertilizer companies, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the ones who are going to take the
brunt of the hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really important that we all
connect and not in fight and come together
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, we have much more
power, uh, coming together as one big loud
[SPEAKER_00]: voice, as we do a bunch of small camps
that are in fighting with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all banging the same drum,
but we're B banging it at a different beat
[SPEAKER_00]: and we all got to get on the same beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's kind of what my goal has
been is to get everybody talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, right now is a great
time because with everything going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer costs are super high or you
can't even get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, a lot of farmers are making the
switch to organic practices, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're going to fail a lot because
their land is screwed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it takes time to repair that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it doesn't take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually take a very short amount
of time if you do it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there are, um, there are a lot of
people that are going to make mistakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they need help and they shouldn't be
ostracized because they've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with chemical nutrients this whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they were taught.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, you can't fault them for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's foolish to try to fight
with the big ag companies because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: never going to win and they're not going
anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our main goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main goal needs to be to show them how
this is the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one thing, farmers can save a lot of
money, uh, by switching to natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're certainly going to save money on
inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your labor is going to go up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but in the end, once the consumer is
fully educated on what nutrient density is
[SPEAKER_00]: and why it is important, uh, how you grow
your crops and medicine is going to become
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental and it will drive the price
of commodities as opposed to there just
[SPEAKER_00]: being a flat price right now, basically,
unless you're in a farmer's market,
[SPEAKER_00]: a tomato is the cost of a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but there, there can be,
um, incentive there for farmers to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the best produce possible as opposed to
the most produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it is a shift that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going from chemical nutrients to natural
farming, what the time savings would be
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the cost savings, the difference in
product and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that, you know, if you're,
you know, buying anything in a bottle,
[SPEAKER_00]: you are mostly paying for water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you're paying for it to be shipped
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, the cost for son of us
to switch from, um, it's regular,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, fertilizer, uh, and amending and all
of its other practices, um, she was
[SPEAKER_00]: spending $2 an acre, um, going from $2 an
acre to 20 cents an acre.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about 10% of the input
cost, um, then, then what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so again, like your input cost will go
down, but you are going to go up in labor
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit because it takes time to make
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you get a group of people
together at the beginning of the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can smash out your inputs for the
whole year in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're making all your inputs in a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the added labor of
applying like maintenance sprays to your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on your setup, if you're a
large scale farm and you have a tractor,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly you have a sprayer for the back
of that tractor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hook your sprayer up and you put
your maintenance spray in there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: drive up and down the rows and it sprays
the spray on your plants and you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that, you know, there are people
who, you know, do a whole orchard in an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they just drive up and down the rows
and they spray and their orchards do that
[SPEAKER_00]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, they're spraying all kinds of
chemicals on those trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just switch over to the K and F
input or whatever other thing you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a natural farming input.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you're not really increasing your
labor costs there because you're already
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying other chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really in those situations,
it's a huge cost savings because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped your inputs down so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that, you know, there are,
there's lots of different natural farming
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out there and you know, there's K
and F and there's JDOM and there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them are interchangeable and
they have different applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot in the way of pest
control and Korean natural farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there is in JDOM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, significant cost savings,
which is what I assumed and what I've
[SPEAKER_01]: heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's really good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few more questions for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them I like to ask towards the end
of every episode, which is really advice
[SPEAKER_01]: for beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are people listening in
here that are transitioning to a large
[SPEAKER_01]: scale operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they just started working in a large
scale operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: What tips do you have for those that are
making that transition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, a laundry list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say that, um, if you're moving
into the industry, um, as a whole,
[SPEAKER_00]: not even just as a grower, um,
it's probably going to dishearten you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there aren't much ethics involved yet,
um, because there isn't a whole lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in the way of legal recourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, uh, just a word of caution there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as far as people, uh, moving into
growing or learning about how to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I, I would say being very careful of
where you're getting information from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are a lot of people out there
who pretend to be experts in everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I will tell you that the Kruger
Dunning syndrome is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, people often before
they, people think they know more than
[SPEAKER_00]: they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, anyone who's claiming to be a master
grower, you should probably be wary of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you use common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, whenever someone is trying to tell you
something, try to think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: does this apply in the natural world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they're like, there's a lot of
tinkering that goes on and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but really keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there are some great learning
resources out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some of them, even though they're
great learning resources, have the
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency to push some, what we would
consider bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's, it may only be bro science
because it hasn't been uh, proven out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that can be peer reviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to be careful when you're
listening to people who do have authority
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of followers and understand that
unless you can find this information in
[SPEAKER_00]: white papers, online, um, scholarly
articles that have been published,
[SPEAKER_00]: then this is just conjecture on someone's
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm a big fan of people saying,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so anyone who can be upfront and
honest about their limitations and their
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you want to listen to those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's probably the best advice I can
give is be careful of who you are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: advice from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, reach out to people who are trusted,
uh, and have been around for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask their advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, feel it out a bit before you
just go down a rabbit hole of adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff to your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've killed all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that would be my second piece of
advice is trial everything out,
[SPEAKER_00]: do side by sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't assume that because you applied
something to your grow and you killed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that thing was the determining
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you apply five other things that you
hadn't done before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you do a side by side with a control
group?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did not do that, you have no idea
that what you have done has been
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial or negative to you in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're moving into this space and
you want to learn the best way possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you are going to tinker, make sure
you're doing side by sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're keeping a track of what
you're doing because in our group,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you say something, you need to be able
to back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have to be something that
is out there for the whole world of
[SPEAKER_00]: published study, but have some data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to debate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to talk about what people have
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't do that work and you just
have a claim, you don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have no idea what you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anything for you at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to find those research papers if
they're out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, sharing, sharing is caring.
[SPEAKER_01]: James, how can the listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can always find us on Facebook
in the Organic Cultivators Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, you know, you got to work to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some questions to answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't, we don't want to do the work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to do some work for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can't at least Google to answer
some questions, you know, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be somebody that takes too much
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people in the group,
people that you know, some bigger names in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, so to speak, and they all
help out in the group, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on Instagram at Organic
Cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have our next
conference in Stirbridge, Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_00]: February 17th, 18th and 19th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 20th will be a special workshop
day with Suzanne Wainwright.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, come check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have Dan Kittredge there and Dr.
James White from Rutgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know who he is, he's done some
amazing work on the rhizophage cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have him come out and
talk and Suzanne Wainwright will be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: OrganicCultivators.net Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to at least
your Instagram down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then of course, if you're listening on
one of the podcast platforms, just search
[SPEAKER_01]: for him, he'll show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: James, thanks again for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely learned a few things and I
think it's going to bring a lot of value
[SPEAKER_01]: to my audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for your time today and I
hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was good to meet you and hope to see
you at the conference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
Peace out, everyone.
Peace out, everyone.
