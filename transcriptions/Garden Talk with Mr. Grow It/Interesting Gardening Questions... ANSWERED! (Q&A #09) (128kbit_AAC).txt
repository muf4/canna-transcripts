[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm back with another Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually the second part of the
previous Q&A video that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were just too many questions,
I couldn't not post some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys rocked it in the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know,
I do record these episodes live on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to ask me questions in the
future and potentially get featured on an
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming episode, follow me at twitch.tv
slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the episode,
I just want to give a quick shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: the sponsor of the episode, Spider Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're starting to sponsor these Q&A
videos, so big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer is well known to produce
high quality LED grow lights at a price
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than nearly all other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have board style LED grow lights,
as well as bar style LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used their SF1000, SF2000,
and SF4000 LED grow lights in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I got some excellent results with
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have grow tents, inline fans,
and carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Spider Farmer down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use discount code MRGROW5
during checkout for a discount on their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello MrGrowIt, I grow with 11-13 light
depth cycle for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, 12-12 is talked about a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits of 12-12 flowering
light cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really comes down to DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: 11-13, 12-12, DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at DLI first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So daily lighting, integral.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much PAR are you giving your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant can only take a certain amount
of light per day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you guys can hear my
cat scratching back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it picks up the audio,
but that's what that staticky type noise
[SPEAKER_00]: was.
[SPEAKER_00]: But DLI, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could literally do a 12-12 light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're blasting your plants with
900 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plant's able to take it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I need to pull out the DLI
calculator, don't I?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go, DLI calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's say you have your plants
on, say you're doing 900 PPFD for 12
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your DLI is 38.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say DLI of around 40,
upwards of DLI of 60, if your conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: are right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your environment is really gonna build
an impact on this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have optimal CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your CO2 is low, that's your limiting
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your other, your plant's gonna operate at
that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD, how's your temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's your humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: But say you're dialed in aiming for a 40
DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could either do a 12-12 light cycle
with a PPFD of 900, or you could do 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: 11 hours on, but increase your light
distance and blast them with 1100 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can literally, you can save energy
consumption now, it's only an hour a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, some people go up to 60
DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you did 11 hour flowering lights on,
PPFD at 1500, you would be reaching a DLI
[SPEAKER_00]: of 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the highest you hear about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, play around with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look into DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking about VPD, I've been tracking
mine per hour, but the night temps have
[SPEAKER_00]: dropped sharply.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what temp during the night period that
would hurt the plant's growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much is it dropping?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, generally speaking,
aim for like a 10 degree drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're talking Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your lights on are about 80 degrees,
going down to 70 degrees, lights off is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do 15 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're outdoors, you're gonna,
you have no control over that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're gonna see some drastic swings
from day to night in some areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as what's bad, it starts to,
the lower the temp gets, the more growth
[SPEAKER_00]: slows down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbe activity in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you're growing organically,
for example, you need to have the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: available and working to break down those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the temperature is too low,
that slows down microbial movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not getting that breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to really get below 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I hit 60 degrees temperature,
I'm like, ugh, indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pretty much answers your
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try and try to stick within like 10
degrees, 15 degrees max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you can stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to add in a space heater,
that's what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to add in a space heater to my grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my grow tents, sometimes I have a space
heater in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air coming into the grow tent is of
the proper temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning using Clonex gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I think one of the biggest things
that people overlook when they're cloning
[SPEAKER_00]: or even seedlings when it's just starting
to root is the temperature in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately a lot of people,
they don't monitor that and they have
[SPEAKER_00]: either poor germination rates or their
roots don't clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that I've struggled with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I started monitoring the
temperature of the medium, making sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: was above 72 degrees Fahrenheit,
between 72 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit is the
[SPEAKER_00]: general range in order to have clones root
or seedlings sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're in a basement and you have
your cups on the ground, solo cups on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground, that's a highly unlikely that
things are going to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it does root, it's going to be
very slow growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one thing in my opinion that
a lot of people overlook is monitoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have seedling mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some seedling mats are stronger than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, you just got to be aware they'll
literally burn, they'll cook it,
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've struggled with that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I put towels in between the
seedling mat, some towels, then the dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can get one of those seedling
mats with the probes and just stick the
[SPEAKER_00]: probe in the medium, that should give you
a general idea of how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you obviously don't want to soak the
probe at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you water the plants, take the
probe out, give it a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: then stick it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can definitely get a
somewhat accurate measurement of the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you're in the general range that
needs to be to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the Clonox gel, rooter cubes,
that stuff will all work for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're having a rooting
hormone, there's several different rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: hormones, you should have more success,
assuming that your other conditions are
[SPEAKER_00]: fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a space heater in my tent that
turns off when a certain temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: reached.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it goes below a certain
temperature, it'll turn on, I assume was
[SPEAKER_00]: what you meant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this causes a large amount
of tematemia fluctuations throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, are these 10 to 15 degree
RH fluctuations gonna negatively impact my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still saying this just your ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just changes constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always gonna be better to be more
stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have these swings throughout the
day, I mean, it's not ideal for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, some genetics are gonna be more
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others, I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're gonna have a plant that gets
so stressed out of herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be able to tell you,
you're gonna be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best thing we could say is,
you know, you're staying in those ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope you don't have those sensitive
genetics that are gonna turn on you and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to limit the swings as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like you're doing everything
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe your temperature is getting too high
and then your exhaust is kicking on,
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking out all the humidity, sucking out
all the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that's what's maybe causing your
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if you try controlling the
temperature of the room that your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent is in, controlling the temperature,
controlling the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the humidity does reach too high
or the temperature does reach too high in
[SPEAKER_00]: your grow tent and your fan's turning on,
assuming you have the AC infinity fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the air coming in will be of the
proper temperature, proper humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thoughts on monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So monster cropping, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about taking a clone,
really it can be any part of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say late flowering and
then bringing it back, re-vegging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need to conserve genetics,
absolutely, monster crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything against monster
cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a technique that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's probably better to just cut a
clone prior to flowering and keeping that
[SPEAKER_00]: clone around instead of going the whole
grow, then doing the monster cropping to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring back that because when you go into
that re-veg period, it takes like a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get into re-veg, it can be
hard to get that thing to root and to get
[SPEAKER_00]: back into re-veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more time consuming to do it that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you start a run of build a soil
craft blend first?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, what soil are you starting
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you starting in bagged soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, I wouldn't add any craft blend in
there to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would wait until 30, 40 days before I
amend in some craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one cup per plant,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to check the directions on that
one, but going by the directions is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting a run with build a soil craft
blend, like say you've done an organic
[SPEAKER_00]: run, you've completed, say you're in a 10
gallon container, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: any size container, you've completed your
organic run.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to reuse the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I would do is recommend
getting a soil test, about $40 from Logan
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs, going to soil doctor, getting those
evaluated and him telling you what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to do any of that,
which I totally understand, it does cost
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those things, just amend in the cup
prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like prior to planting, some people do
a cover crop in between and then let that
[SPEAKER_00]: die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether they have clovers and they're
getting nitrogen fixation coming down in
[SPEAKER_00]: their medium, it really depends on your
goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, if you just use the craft
blend, once you're finished with your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, digging up an area, putting in some
craft blend, you know, planning it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people let it cook or let it sit for
a week or two, sometimes even longer than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those amendments start to break down,
but I've certainly planted directly into
[SPEAKER_00]: it and have been fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: My eyes weren't veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would only need to water every four to
five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the second week of flower and
seem to want water two to three days now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that normal based on my environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be a ton of contributing
factors to that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to imagine the bigger plant
gets, the more it's going to need as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as uptake of water nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your environment can certainly have an
impact in that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you run a very, very dry environment
like I live in, the less humid it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see higher transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can actually run into an issue
running too low of humidity to where you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a toxicity issue, too much nutrients
in the medium, increased transpiration due
[SPEAKER_00]: to low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get like toxicity a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want from a prone to a toxicity that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but it makes total sense for the
medium to dry it every two to three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, it's building flowers,
you know, it's taking the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And building biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger the plan to get it is getting
the more water and nutrients that is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to decide between building a cloner
or setting up an auto water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you prioritize first and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, me personally, I would probably go
to the auto watering system first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get a 12 pack of blue mats
for under a hundred bucks and the 12 pack
[SPEAKER_00]: of blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think you have to buy the reservoir
separately, but literally you can buy like
[SPEAKER_00]: a trash bin or a small bin, you know,
15 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can find them for 10 bucks as
you use that as a reservoir, just drill a
[SPEAKER_00]: hole in it and run the line from there to
your blue mats and getting 12 of those
[SPEAKER_00]: carrots for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it's like 80 bucks or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may be able to, may even be able to
get them cheaper off of happy hydro.com
[SPEAKER_00]: and using my discount code, Mr. Grow it,
you get a percentage off there for,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that might be cheaper than going
through Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I would set up the auto water
system first and I would go with the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: matches because of the cheaper ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also used the auto pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: System and, uh, it's just more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of prefer the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found transplanting once it seems to
work best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times do you transplant before
the final container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I've done it so many ways over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, currently what I'm doing, I'm planting
into one gallon containers to start and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just doing one transplant into seven
gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, recently over the past few grows and
I've liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I've done the startup in
solo cups, transplant up to one gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant up to three gallons or
transplant to one, uh, to one gallons to
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger the roots, bigger the fruits is a
term that a lot of people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being in a large container during
flowering, um, is definitely going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as far as well, the roots don't build
up kind of those root balls on a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get another root ball forming in
the one container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get another root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Root ball within root ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that helps with bigger
fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I personally like to just start in one
gallon containers and then transplant into
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really liking doing that or just
planting in the final container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's, it can be tough not to
auto over water in some cases,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, especially if you're a
beginner.
