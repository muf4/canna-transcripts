[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the world, both beginners and experts
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_03]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_03]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 135.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, I interview Bryant Mason,
also known as The Soil Doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was on the podcast once before,
episode 26, back in 2021, where he talked
[SPEAKER_03]: all about soil testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He did a soil audit walkthrough and also
talked about some of the elements of a
[SPEAKER_03]: plant growth and got into heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: This time around, he talks about water
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my local water tested here and he
brought down the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also got the soil in my backyard tested
and he goes over those results as well and
[SPEAKER_03]: gives me suggestions for improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: These episodes are broken down into small
clips.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see those, subscribe to the
Garden Talk Clips channel on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_03]: the general public.

[SPEAKER_03]: And we are back and I'm joined with the
soil doctor, Brian Mason.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for coming back onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to look it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: August 7th, 2021 was when the last episode
dropped.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing I like to look at and
talk about is the number of views it got.
[SPEAKER_03]: So 30,000 views on that episode,
which is pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It always surprises me that there are so
many people out there that are tuning into
[SPEAKER_03]: these and it just shows that they're a lot
of people interested in gardening and
[SPEAKER_03]: better their garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Excited to have you back on here and talk
about soil science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was fun to meet you even for just a
short moment this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a special thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we were able to meet in person at
the soil summit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was there for the first day and yeah,
I know you had a good talk there and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and really a lot of value that
you add in to the whole community really.
[SPEAKER_03]: So appreciate what you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the last episode when we got together,
we went over a soil test, but it was a
[SPEAKER_03]: soil test from soil that I had outdoors,
but it was originally bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like reused soil and I was
growing medicinal plants in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also did a soil audit walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you actually walked through the entire
soil report, talked about some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: different elements for growth,
and we got into heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: This time around, we're going to go over
another soil report, but we're also going
[SPEAKER_03]: to go over a water analysis report too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of laughing a little bit
because the water report is tap water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in Las Vegas and we're known to
have very hard water.
[SPEAKER_03]: I measure it at 485 PPM, which is like
very high.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think EPA guidelines is like no more
than 500 or else it's considered unsafe or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so it's very high as far as PPM.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the soil report we're going to go
over is from my backyard and I live in Las
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas and it's just a lot of rock and
desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm looking to reverse survive that
soil and grow some vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some trees out there that I'm
going to be growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so looking to see how your analysis of
it and just suggestions for proving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I glanced at your water report before
and it's going to be a fun one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, before we get too deep into it,
can you introduce yourself for the folks
[SPEAKER_03]: that didn't catch the first episode we did
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a certified crop advisor and I focus
on organic nutrient management.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work in various crop types,
helping growers improve their soil
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility with precision nutrient
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the process typically looks like,
you know, with a grower, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers test their soil and then I do the
agronomic math and write organic amendment
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also analyze water tests and tissue
tests quite extensively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have an online course for
people who really want to deepen their
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of nutrient management and
spend 15 hours just becoming more
[SPEAKER_01]: self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone's interested in that,
they can find everything I offer on my
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly as a crop advisor, I'm just
focusing on nutrient management,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily IPM or environmental
controls or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's the brief introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a farm of my own in Western
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow vegetables and medicinal plants
like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my cash crop, I have a thousand peach
trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an orchardist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm really interested in free
production as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year is going to be my first peach
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted the trees three seasons ago,
three summers ago, and they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving and huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a bunch of peaches on the
trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some folks might recognize your name
from my book, my second book that I just
[SPEAKER_03]: released January 1st this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gave you a mention.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about kind of soil testing,
how you should get your soil tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can also link up with
somebody like you, who's going to be able
[SPEAKER_03]: to give you advice on what you can do for
the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really this episode, you're going to
kind of get a glimpse of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_03]: Would you want to start with the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's start with the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that was your your primary or your
main priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say before we dive into
this, I think this is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: underutilized, underrated single test that
people can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is sort of
twofold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that if you think about
inputs to your system, to your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: water is the biggest input.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over multiple irrigation cycles,
over multiple years, whatever's in your
[SPEAKER_01]: water is going to influence the soil
solution more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil solution is essentially the
water that's available for roots in the
[SPEAKER_01]: pore space of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whatever the chemistry of your
water is, that's really what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: define the chemistry of your soil solution
over the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's your biggest input from a heavy
metal standpoint, from a salt standpoint,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a nutrient standpoint oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other thing is water does
change, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like wells, for example,
can fluctuate a little bit from fall to
[SPEAKER_01]: spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by and large, water, a single water
test will tell you exactly what your water
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to look like or the pattern that
it's going to exhibit over the long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, in my opinion, you only need to
get one water test and then you know your
[SPEAKER_01]: water forever, more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to double check things,
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get three water tests,
they're all going to look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll look pretty similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason I like that is you only have
to pay for one water test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very inexpensive and you get a really
good sense of the chemistry of your of
[SPEAKER_01]: your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that people often look
at and it's the first metric on the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: test is pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers are familiar with pHing their
water up or down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, it's going to be down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pH is important, but it doesn't tell
the full story of whether or not you
[SPEAKER_01]: should acidify your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get to why that is with a second
metric a little bit further down the water
[SPEAKER_01]: report.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next metric on the soil report is
hardness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned this hardness is really just
a summation or an or an aggregate
[SPEAKER_01]: calculation of the calcium and the
magnesium content in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just telling you the
mineralization of calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty simple equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look up online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in your case, you have three hundred
and thirty eight parts per million of
[SPEAKER_01]: hardness, which is a lot like you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of hardness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a lot of calcium and or
magnesium in your water and we'll get to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to back up, I didn't actually
mention what your water pH was for
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's seven point seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right away you think, oh, that's pretty
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you should pH down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's wait on that conclusion until
we see another reading closer to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom of the report called alkalinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your pH is seven seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your hardness is three hundred and thirty
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that probably fluctuates
depending on, you know, the Las Vegas
[SPEAKER_01]: supply and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardness is always going to be high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump down to there's another
thing or three things hardness grains,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is just another way to measure
hardness conductivity, which is a salt
[SPEAKER_01]: reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an EC reading and then sodium
adsorption ratio, which matters in
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomic topsoil field production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the purposes of this conversation,
we can skip it because it's really just a
[SPEAKER_01]: computed, calculated number that's getting
at how much sodium there is in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any initial thoughts or
questions before we keep going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, couple just to back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned one water test should be
fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really not going to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard it may be changed over the years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, should it be, you know, maybe this
year get a test next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could see a different result or are
you saying, no, that wouldn't be the case?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'll always see fluctuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you took a test tomorrow,
you would see the numbers just slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my belief is the pattern of what we're
going to see here on this report isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, the pH might fluctuate a couple
of tenths of a point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hardness may go up or down,
even 20 or 50 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the underlying pattern of the water is
going to be the same, which is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have hard water with high pH, high sodium,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a consultant, I think there are
tests that you should take frequently,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm constantly aware that you're
trying to save money as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think the low-hanging fruit is
to continually water test because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much going to come to the same
conclusion, even though it will fluctuate
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, of course, there's going to be parts
of the country where the water fluctuates
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not a universal statement,
but by and large, you only need to take
[SPEAKER_01]: one water test, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a few more questions,
but I'll gather some more questions and
[SPEAKER_03]: ask them when we're done with the water
section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's always most interesting to me
when I see a high pH is the next five or
[SPEAKER_01]: six things I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium, magnesium, potassium,
and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the dominant cations in soil,
and they are the dominant cations in
[SPEAKER_01]: water, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to really define the
cation balance in your soil solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three out of the four of these are
nutrients to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sodium's not a nutrient, but calcium,
magnesium, and potassium are extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: important beneficial nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the balance of those three really
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So calcium's 107 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what's creating all that
hardness in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in this arid environment in the
western United States that doesn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of rainfall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very natural for there to be
really high calcium levels in the parent
[SPEAKER_01]: material and in the rock formations and
the geology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the water moves across the
surface of the land or underground,
[SPEAKER_01]: it picks up those calcium ions,
and that's why your calcium is high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now luckily, calcium is a nutrient for
plants, and it's a very important,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe underrated nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's fantastic in certain ways that
the calcium is so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the calcium is coming with other
things that usually aren't as beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hardness in and of itself is not a
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That high calcium is, in my opinion,
a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magnesium is 17 parts per million,
which is slightly elevated, but compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to the calcium is not very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that calcium to magnesium ratio in your
water is just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The potassium's three parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very rare to see high potassium in
natural sources of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, is this municipal water
from Las Vegas?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the kicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to jump to sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, in my opinion, the greatest
weakness of this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not pH, it's not salts, it's not
hardness, it's sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your sodium is a whopping 48 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there could be a number of reasons why
this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is the city of Las Vegas could
be trying to soften the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you soften water, there's a
number of different ways to soften water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the most cost effective ways is
to exchange sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're essentially removing the
calcium and the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in doing so, you're sort of replacing
it with sodium salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's possible that just through water
softening, they're increasing the sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: content of the water, trying to get below
the EPA limits or whatever regulations
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to follow, maybe trying to
make it taste better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know hard water can be tough on
plumbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they could be essentially creating
elevated sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other possibility is, again,
there's just high sodium in the source of
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as it runs across the surface of the
desert or underground, maybe it's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from Lake Powell, maybe it's just grabbing
sodium from the environment, from the arid
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any case, unfortunately,
these are the cards you've been dealt,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's really not optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will be something that you'll
need to manage over time, is this high
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I guess I'll pause and get your
reaction or your thoughts or questions
[SPEAKER_01]: about the sodium or about any of these
cations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, high sodium.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you mentioned the sea appear to be
softening the water, kind of unrelated
[SPEAKER_03]: question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that mean I don't need a water
softener?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking to potentially get more of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to your drinking water,
your shower, not like shower glass,
[SPEAKER_01]: not showing stains, water softeners work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to plant production,
I am not a fan of water softeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're a horrible idea because
they're removing calcium and magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are plant nutrients, and they're
adding sodium, which is not a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient and in fact, is very antagonistic
and problematic in plant production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have never recommended a water
softener.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, I'm frequently recommending
to scrap the water softener when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to irrigation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was, I was kind of leaning towards
the whole, you know, dishwashing and
[SPEAKER_03]: cleaning floors and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unrelated, like I mentioned, because the
fiance wants a water softener.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can come to her and say,
Hey, you know what, we already got sodium
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to, you know, we don't need
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might, you might, for your dishwasher
and for clean dishes, you may want to
[SPEAKER_01]: soften it further.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your plants won't appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's other ways, there's other
salts that can be used in water softeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: like potassium salts, but still I wouldn't
want to crank my potassium up necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might be a balance there,
but I would never use a sodium salt in
[SPEAKER_01]: water softeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually you don't have control.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just plug them in and you kind of buy
what's manufactured.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm assuming that at the end
recommends some sort of filtration.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was going to ask what options are
there to filter this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not sure I'm getting ahead of the
conversation here or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so no, let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to sodium, really the
only solution is to filter it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you don't have control over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is a water softening process from
the city of Las Vegas, you don't go over
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get what comes out of the tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so there's really only one filter that
I know of that removes sodium effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's RO filtration, which is really
unfortunate for small scale growers
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the economic, how much they
cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, RO really is unfortunate
because it produces a lot of wastewater.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about it, that wastewater
that produces is even higher in
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration than the water going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to do something with that
wastewater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not a very, you have to think
about what to do with the wastewater
[SPEAKER_01]: before you install RO filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other filters out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers all the time, when I analyze water
tests say, oh, I'm using a hydrologic
[SPEAKER_01]: filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're called all boys or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen dozens of tests and these just,
they don't, they don't work that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've taken tests of the water
before and the water after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so inexpensive filters just don't tend
to remove, they might remove like five
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million or something of sodium,
but they really don't clean the water like
[SPEAKER_01]: they need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the one option is, you know,
you filter the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second option is you actually can
manage without filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially what that looks like is
you irrigate and you balance the other
[SPEAKER_01]: cations with nutrient applications and you
water with your high sodium water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every once in a while you flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen is you, you irrigate
with high sodium water and over time that
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium accumulates in your soil because
the plants, well, let's just say a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: that water evaporates into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the sodium doesn't evaporate with the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sodium stays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the water comes in with the sodium,
the H2O evaporates, but the sodium stays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over time it starts to accumulate in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you really start to see
issues with nutrient antagonisms or what
[SPEAKER_01]: people call lockouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even salt stress on your plants
because your sodium is getting too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can flush that sodium out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can irrigate with your high sodium
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it accumulates, you just do
a big flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: A flushing or leaching event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of just run tons of water
through your soil profile and that all
[SPEAKER_01]: that excess sodium will essentially get
flushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you add gypsum during that
leaching event, it'll actually be more
[SPEAKER_01]: effective in reducing sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're never getting the sodium to
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just reverting your soil back to
that 48 parts per million, because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what is in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's going to happen over time is
it's going to go from 48 to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 75 to 100, you know, it's high as who
knows how high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you leach it, it kind of brings
it back to 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if you're planting in ground,
you would do a flush like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very common agronomically in
what's called sodic soils, which are high
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium soils to leach the sodium out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that assumes that your soil drains
well and that you have enough water.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do this kind of flush, you're not like
water scarce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not perfectly effective by any
means, but this is how like people in
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona grow all the time in topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now if you had like a really poor
draining soil or really clay soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: like for whatever reason, you just
couldn't do that, then it's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be as good of an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want your soil to drain well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really got to just like leave the
sprinklers on for a couple of days type
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also something you don't have to
worry about yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can sort of ignore this problem for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a high precipitation place,
places that get more than about 30 inches
[SPEAKER_01]: of rainfall per year, which isn't Nevada,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for listeners who have maybe high
sodium water, but live in a place where it
[SPEAKER_01]: rains a lot, that process happens
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you never seeing elevated sodium
because the water, the rainfall just keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: moving through the soil profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sodium luckily is very mobile in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it moves through the soil profile and
out of the root zone pretty easily.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the sodium listed here,
you have 48 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said it competes with the other
cations, potassium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_03]: calcium, and calcium is higher at 107
magnesium is at 17 and then potassium is
[SPEAKER_03]: at 3.4.
[SPEAKER_03]: So is that enough calcium, I guess,
enough for the other cations to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: compete with the sodium?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, there's two issues with
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that it competes with the uptake of
other cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other is that it increases the
osmotic stress, or let's just call it salt
[SPEAKER_01]: stress on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at high levels, it just adds more salt
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes it's harder for the plants
to uptake water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at these levels, it technically what
the plant is seeing is mille equivalence,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a little bit more accurate way to
look at cations is like mille equivalence
[SPEAKER_01]: looks at the size of the ions in addition
to the quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would worry about it antagonizing
potassium first, and then magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will reduce the uptake of calcium,
but the what's going to really hold your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants back is going to be potassium and
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see that on the saturated paste
report, which is a soil report.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at percentages, let's wait on
jumping over there for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be the place to see if it's
going to really create like nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies of other cations would be on
the paste analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's mostly potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there's going to be issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do we need to know about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I mentioned high pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might think, oh, can you,
can you acidify the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you could, you could drop the pH of
your water with acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there's, you know, some,
some waters have a pH of 7.7 and they just
[SPEAKER_01]: need a tiny, tiny bit of acid to drop the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other waters with a pH of 7.7
where you need quite a bit, maybe a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: handful, um, in a drum of water or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is it that a water, one water with
the same pH as another water might need a
[SPEAKER_01]: little versus a lot of acid to drop the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something called alkalinity,
which is the, the water's resistance to pH
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with water that has low alkalinity,
what that means is that the soil is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to buffer the pH very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have low alkalinity in your
water, uh, your soil, it'll just very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly reflect the soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or another way to say it is it's not
going to change the soil pH very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a water with a lot of alkalinity
means there's a lot of minerals that are
[SPEAKER_01]: all putting upper pressure on the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a water that should be acidified
because it will influence the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution pH quite significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So luckily, even though your pH is 7.7,
your alkalinity is relatively low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the kind of arbitrary number I
use for alkalinity and when to acidify
[SPEAKER_01]: versus when to not is 120 parts per
million, and you're at 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, you know, the high pH isn't
ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not optimal, but it shouldn't
dramatically affect your soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just giving a little foreshadowing to
your soil, your soil is a very mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: rich calcareous high calcium, very high pH
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this water is not going to affect the
soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soil pH is like, it's like an ocean
liner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to be able to move it
very easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would not acidify this water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's the right use of
time, money, effort, energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some other stuff on this
test that we can just breeze through
[SPEAKER_01]: bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bicarbonate is the most common ion that,
that creates high pH and high alkalinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're at 85 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so essentially what you're doing when
you add acid is you're neutralizing that
[SPEAKER_01]: bicarbonate and that drops the alkalinity
and the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably, you know, there's
probably sodium bicarbonate in your water,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially baking soda.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just another, uh, mineral that's
in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then chloride and sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chloride at 94 parts per million is
slightly elevated, but the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage chloride is not to freak out about
how much is in your water, but rather to
[SPEAKER_01]: just keep an eye on chloride levels on the
saturated paste report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that starts getting elevated,
then you know, you should do a leaching
[SPEAKER_01]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, similar to what I discussed with
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sulfur is a beneficial plant nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very high in the arid West in soil,
oftentimes and oftentimes in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, you have high sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the salt concentration of your
water is coming from the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's coming from the sodium,
but you have a whopping 235 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million of, of sulfate in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only do you have sodium
bicarbonate, but you also probably have
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum, which is calcium sulfate in your
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not a bad thing, but, um, you know,
that's, that's also adding to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the salinity of your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good news there is, you know,
you, you may not need to apply as much
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum to your soil because you're just
getting free calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sulfur now, unfortunately it's coming
with sodium and fluoride and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, so the, the reading on this,
you know, this salt concentration is
[SPEAKER_01]: showing 618 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, you're, you're reading
400, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point is it's elevated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have salty water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those salts are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the limitation really on this test
is sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the final four things that you
added, this isn't included on all Logan
[SPEAKER_01]: tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't get them tested is
nitrate, um, phosphorus and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: so nitrates 1.8 PPM, honestly a little
more than I'd want, but it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine for drinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then no phosphorus essentially,
which is really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be very strange if you saw
phosphorus in your drinking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then there's two other metrics,
PHC, which just says like, is the water
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be just depositing minerals or
stripping minerals from your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yours is 7.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a resounding deposition water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be providing minerals to the
soil because it's so high in salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you are a filtered it, it would
drop to like below one and that would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: water that's, that's essentially,
um, you know, water's polar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wants to like consume, it wants to
pull minerals into solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's less than like one,
it'll be pulling minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like the word stripping that sort
of has a negative connotation,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though that is sort of what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the adjusted SAR sodium
adsorption ratio, that just means you have
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of that, that's a, that's a very
relevant measurement agronomically for
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil because it's speaking to the
sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's more of a, it's not really
helpful for, for growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more, it's helpful for people like me
to determine when to suggest leaching
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this case, I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's everything on the water report
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a few questions in regards to
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You talked about adjusting the pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't really have to adjust the pH
in my particular case, but just for the
[SPEAKER_03]: folks listening, what are some general
recommendations as far as how to adjust
[SPEAKER_03]: the pH?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mentioned for down, it would be some
sort of acid, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're talking phosphoric acid or you're
talking something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also what would you generally use
to adjust the pH upward?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on if you're an organic
grower or not in organic production,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only two products that are allowed to
lower water pH are citric acid or I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, organic acids, but generally that's
citric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any organic acid could reduce water pH
and that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, organic acids have, you know,
carbon and the most common and the least
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive is citric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the other option that's more,
even more economic and really the only
[SPEAKER_01]: viable option for growers that are growing
at scale is sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sulfuric acid is pretty caustic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta be careful working with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just be careful with the PPE.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, if you're, you know, for growers
like around me who are reducing their
[SPEAKER_01]: water pH, they use sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sulfur burners, which is a
technique that used to be used in indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes you're like essentially
sterilizing a room with a sulfur burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're burning sulfur and
injecting it into your irrigation water
[SPEAKER_01]: and it reduces the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for small growers, organic acids are
generally the best option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, that's, that's, I guess what
I could say there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some people get creative with
like different ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, really acidic ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, in theory you could do it
with a, with like a humic substance,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it doesn't make sense because you're
really trying to do this on an ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to continually reduce water pH with a
humic acid would be overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then pH up, I rarely am increasing
pH because generally an easier way to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it is just put, just push your soil pH up
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you water with an acidic
water in a, and you water a high pH soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: they combine and create a really good
optimal pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my opinion, you just want to line
your soil up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's okay to use a slightly acidic
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sometimes occasionally if I like over
pH, you know, if I'm, if I'm reducing the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH of my water and I overdo it,
I'll just throw in a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: powdered lime, calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the bottled products that are more
common would be like potassium bicarbonate
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, there's just not many instances
when I'm recommending an increase in the
[SPEAKER_01]: water pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, usually I'm decreasing pH and really
I'm just personally, I decrease pH most
[SPEAKER_01]: often when I'm doing foliar sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to decrease my foliar spray
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it improves the efficiency of the
foliar and I always just use citric acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple more questions here on the water
report.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a couple of things here that this
report doesn't show that are big concerns
[SPEAKER_03]: for growers, which is chlorine and
chloramine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
those two things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm curious how the lab tests chloride
and if chlorine and chloramine are
[SPEAKER_01]: included in the chloride number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I should know, but I would need to
think about the chemistry there and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: look, look at the molecules and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, even if it was included in the
chloride number, you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: know the difference between, uh,
chloride, chloramine and chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, if I had to sort of, my guess is
those two are, are concerns of growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: not necessarily from a chemistry
standpoint or from a biological
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're natural sterilizing agents
in our water, um, to clean up our water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nobody gets, you know, lethally
ill, but you know, yeah, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's a, it's a question of what,
whether we should be drinking it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those numbers aren't reported,
I guess is the short answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, my general view of biology is
that there's not enough of those two
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals in the water to like smoke the
biology in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concentrations are low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So biology is very resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I've never seen or heard of a
reduction in biological activity,
[SPEAKER_01]: abundance or diversity because someone's
using a water treated with chlorine or
[SPEAKER_01]: chloramine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you went high enough with
those, you could absolutely kill
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally speaking, I don't think
municipalities are pushing them,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, high enough to, to really,
you know, kill everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are they killing some things?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good, it's a, it's a, I guess
that's an open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no one's ever presented evidence to me
that it's reducing crop quality or
[SPEAKER_01]: production or yield or even biological
numbers, but that's not to say it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just question that assumption a
little bit and just, I'd love to see like
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who, um, I mean, I guess that the
best way to, to answer that question would
[SPEAKER_01]: be there's something called DNA
sequencing, where you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: sequence the entire genome of the soil,
every single organism in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be interesting to see, to sequence a
soil before and then after like a season
[SPEAKER_01]: of chlorine and chloramine application to
see if, um, the total numbers of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of organisms decreases.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be really interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause generally, you know, for chloramine,
for example, it's generally said that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nothing that can be done in order
to eliminate chloramine, but for chlorine,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of growers, they're doing a couple
of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're either letting their water sit out
for a period of 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some say that if you, if you have a light
on it, that helps reduce the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: chlorine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also some people saying that it
sticks to your skin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people actually stick their hand
in the bucket of water, swirled around and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're saying that's reducing the amount
of chlorine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any truth to either one of those
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can definitely speak to the first
thing and say, yes, if you leave it out,
[SPEAKER_01]: it volatilizes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the sunlight, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might, it might degrade the molecule or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the arm, don't, I don't know,
but my gut tells me no.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gut tells me you just smell it on your,
it's, you know, you're just smelling the
[SPEAKER_01]: water on your arm, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it could be, there could be some kind
of like light electrical charge that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grabs the molecules a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in any case, I wouldn't be too worried
about it unless you're using like a really
[SPEAKER_01]: strong, like, you know, it was pool water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be worried about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, everyone has a different
style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that that's generally not the
low hanging fruit in, in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: yield and crop quality as for,
in my experience, but it's not to say you
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't be thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then last question on the water side
from me is I want to get your overall
[SPEAKER_03]: thoughts on kind of some of the water
treatment options out there that
[SPEAKER_03]: neutralize contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there's a product out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I won't name the product, but it says it
neutralizes and assists in reduction over
[SPEAKER_03]: 250 contaminants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It reduces lead, chlorine, fluoride,
and 99% of industrial chemicals and 99% of
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also remineralizes, adds in like
calcium, phosphorus, potassium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think there are numerous products out
there that do something like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: but generally are these products something
that you recommend or recommend that you
[SPEAKER_03]: avoid, that people avoid or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's sort of two categories of
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can think of there's filtration products
and then there's like additives generally
[SPEAKER_01]: with any kind of filtration.
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation is take a water test
before the filter, install the filter,
[SPEAKER_01]: take a water test after the filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's not showing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely not pharmaceuticals and
hormones and chloramine and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you see the numbers decrease of the
things you are testing for, then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the filter is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if these things don't decrease,
well, I can bet you they're not taking
[SPEAKER_01]: anything else out either.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of filters that don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't work and there's a really
simple solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just test before and after and
determine if your filter is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think filters work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of them are extremely
effective and some of them are not very
[SPEAKER_01]: effective and there's a whole spectrum and
usually that's correlated with the price
[SPEAKER_01]: of the filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, I believe in filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe in additives like things
you add to the water that tie up because
[SPEAKER_01]: here's what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to what I was explaining with
sodium, that water goes into the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: it may tie up things so it's not plant
available or it's enclosed in a molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: and so the microbes in the soil and the
plants can't access that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, those degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And biology, there's a whole cycling
process that happens in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put an ion of lead in the soil,
well, it may be complexed or chelated
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over time, eventually that's going to
become available because it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle into availability and out of
availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thousand times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it comes to heavy metals and
really anything, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: tying it up is a short term solution,
but long term, you're not solving
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you really just want to avoid the
addition of heavy metals to begin with
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're going to just like sodium,
they're going to accumulate as the water
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporates and they stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because they're tied up now
doesn't mean they're going to be tied up
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing is permanent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The product I was mentioning is in your
definition an additive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a liquid bottle that you would add
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that seems fishy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's probably like a carbon based
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it's not carbon based,
it's like definitely not organic and you
[SPEAKER_01]: might be creating other contamination
issues, you know, like chelates aren't the
[SPEAKER_01]: kindest thing either, synthetic chelates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not recommend that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot, unfortunately in the world
of water, there's sort of like a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: snake oil and there's a lot of things that
I don't even want to call them snake oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say like they're unproven
or they're sort of questionable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some reason this, I mean,
all the way from like structured water to
[SPEAKER_01]: magnified and electrified water,
there's just like this whole rabbit hole
[SPEAKER_01]: of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone down it unfortunately and gotten
like, you know, sold on things and then
[SPEAKER_01]: had to sort of come back out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And realize like, wait, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I should stop obsessing about the
quality of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen, and I haven't seen any
improvements in crop health and yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to invest in something
that you're not sure about or that you
[SPEAKER_01]: think could be, you know, kind of bogus,
what I always recommend is do a split
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like if possible, break your farm,
your garden, your grow and just in half
[SPEAKER_01]: and do no treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the treatment on half and do the
treatment on the other half and just
[SPEAKER_01]: observe if you see a difference,
like make the results speak for
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every product should have to prove
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's often difficult with water
because you're installing something and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the source of your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you going to like, you know,
go back and forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, that's the concept I think
all growers should always be thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about is like, if you're going to invest
money, try to figure out a way to like
[SPEAKER_01]: prove it to yourself that it's going to
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we move on to the soil test now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do we need to know about the soil
test?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two different ones from Logan
Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one that's labeled as soil report,
and then there's one labeled as saturated
[SPEAKER_03]: paste report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in general, my recommendation to
growers is to get a complete soil test
[SPEAKER_01]: from Logan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Logan's my go-to lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only lab I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've calibrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen, you know, tens of thousands of
these tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't really switch labs because all
labs are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really recommend Logan Labs
partially because they do what's called a
[SPEAKER_01]: saturated paste test as part of their
complete analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a standard soil test generally uses
a strong acid and they extract all these
[SPEAKER_01]: theoretically available nutrients with an
acid with a pH of 2.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's supposed to show you what's your
bank account of nutrients looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what you see on kind of like
any normal soil report.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have different acid extractions
and different techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what Logan does is they then take your
soil and they combine it with your
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation water and they do a water
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the one hand, you see the standard
soil test that's like all the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that may be available over decades in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see the saturated paste test,
which is, okay, what are the nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that are available today that are soluble,
that are available to your roots right
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality is not one or the other,
but it's really helpful to see both of
[SPEAKER_01]: those tests to be able to sort of see
what's happening real time as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: general chemical pattern of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why I recommend getting both
of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess like the first thing just kind
of like, instead of going through it all
[SPEAKER_01]: in great detail, which I cover in my
course and it takes hours, let me just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of point out a couple of things about
your soil that I feel like are relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing on the standard test that
I see is you have a organic matter of one
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, which is is unfortunately quite
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this means is, yeah, you probably
have a gravelly, rocky, sandy soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: just doesn't hold organic matter like a
clay soil would.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just so it's partially just a
function of the soil texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also is a function of where you
live in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, generally organic matter levels
aren't super high in arid environments
[SPEAKER_01]: because there hasn't been eons of tropical
jungles and plant growth and forests and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just not a lot of vegetation
that's gone into that soil over the long
[SPEAKER_01]: term.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best solution for you, in my
opinion, for your nutrient management is
[SPEAKER_01]: is simply large amounts of biomass of
compost, manure, mulch, small amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: wood chips and biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, anything, any carbon based input
and specifically just compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, large applications of compost,
I think will work wonders in combination
[SPEAKER_01]: with just garden it, covercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whether it's your vegetables and
your trees or if it's a cover crop,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a living cover crop over time,
that will really start to raise organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter and just start pushing carbon into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long term process, but the
combination of carbon based inputs and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually like covercropping is the best
solution for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, mineralization through
organic amendments will help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, over the long
term, you just want to get more organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of your like your insurance
policy against all nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would worm castings be in that category?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm castings are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the problem with being in Nevada
or Arizona or Colorado is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: problems with the water that we're looking
at and the same problems with the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have are also going to be seen in
the compost that you buy commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be high in sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to be high in calcium
and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like, there's not a perfect
antidote from a compost standpoint
[SPEAKER_01]: generally, because it's going to have the
same sort of underlying pattern as these
[SPEAKER_01]: other things in the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, castings, if you can make them,
just carbon of all kinds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like heavy mulch, leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would personally, in an arid
environment with low organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually like tillage only because I'm
able to incorporate these carbon sources
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can like just broad fork or
double dig organic matter as deep as you
[SPEAKER_01]: can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then over time, you can back off on
the disturbance on the tillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for right now, I would just try to get
tons of organic matter in that soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's rocky out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to use a jackhammer in order to get
down low.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the other thing that soil tests
won't show you is rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, rocks are like, obviously everyone
knows rocks are not good for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so sometimes the best investment you
can make in a field or a garden is rock
[SPEAKER_01]: picking, which is extraordinarily time and
energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like these old farms around here where
the entire edge of the farm is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: giant pile of rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some old timer pioneer literally
like pick the rocks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the best long term investment
they could have made in that field because
[SPEAKER_01]: to this day, like people can grow in it
and they're not, you know, and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in a garden scale, but there's
implements on tractors that can like,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're called rock pickers that can
remove rocks from fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get the rocks out, jackhammer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go as deep as you can go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the process as you're disturbing it
and getting the rocks out, try to get
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, organic matter, mulch,
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other things I'm seeing on here is
like your phosphorus is particularly low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to look at phosphorus on the
standard test is you have 28 pounds per
[SPEAKER_01]: acre of phosphate, which is P2O5 for
really heavy feeding vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heavy applications of bone meal,
I think would serve you very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and bone meal or fish bone meal,
whatever your preference is also brings
[SPEAKER_01]: in, uh, three to 4% nitrogen, 3% on bone
meal, 4% on fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I would be thinking about like in
year one and two, like my primary nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: source in addition to the compost would
be, would be some kind of bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that'll just really push your
phosphorus levels way up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And provide quite a bit of available
nitrogen as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, fish bone meal also has nice
micronutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The downside of fish bone meal is it's
from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it also has high sodium and chloride,
which you already have an excess of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I'd go with bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so between the bone meals and the
heavy compost slash castings application,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that will probably get you the
nitrogen that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nitrogen, your available nitrogen,
which is tested on a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inorganic forms of ammonium and nitrate
are both like less than one PPM,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the production system,
you want that quite a bit higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 25 to 125 parts per million of
nitrate, depending on what you're growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: how long it's in the ground, uh,
top soil versus, you know, Pete based
[SPEAKER_01]: engineered media.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of variables,
but for your, for you perennial trees and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables, I would want that at 30 to
40%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 parts per million of nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heavy compost and bone meal should get
you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best thing to do is incorporate
those things and then retest and see
[SPEAKER_01]: where, see where things fall because
compost is highly variable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's, it's, it's hard to be
precise with compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing to do is just get it in
there and then retest and see where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in general, I mean, uh,
just to give you a rate on compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or castings, let's just say it's a 1%
nitrogen compost, which is pretty typical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like a rich compost, uh, castings,
yeah, let's just say 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would apply 20 tons per acre,
which is like 440 pounds per thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet, but quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you spread that though,
it spreads out pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's like probably only a
quarter inch or something, but you could
[SPEAKER_01]: easily go with like a half an inch deep
and then, and then work it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and people with a, with a more mellow
compost, you can go way heavier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do two inches and just really work
it in heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never recommend applying more than two
inches of compost in a single application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would want that to be like a mellow
yard waste sort of compost, not a manure
[SPEAKER_01]: based compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Castings tend to be rich depending on how
they're made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you make them yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do have a warm bin, so I do that,
but it's real small scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small bin in my garage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your case, you're just applying
everything you can make.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just make as much as you can as
fast as you can and just get it out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a local source that has worm
castings, but they also add in kelp and
[SPEAKER_03]: rock dust, which I thought was kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both great products for trace minerals,
non-essential, but highly beneficial and
[SPEAKER_01]: bio stimulating trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, I've always used rock dust and
kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've backed off recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting tested for arsenic in
your, you know, cash crop, I would not use
[SPEAKER_01]: those, but, um, or heavy metals just in
general, but I've always used them in my
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable garden because I'm trying to
sort of increase the mineralization of my
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a well made compost, just buy it
liberally as much as you can afford up to
[SPEAKER_01]: two inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if you overshoot and it's a little
too rich and your, your nutrients get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little too high, that's generally okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's a compost based nutrient,
you're using some synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot more risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but over-applying compost is in your
case, probably not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, let me just jump to a couple of
other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, your, your soil has a pH of 8.6,
which is probably shockingly high for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of listeners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it is quite high, way above
optimal and, um, yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make the point that an excessively
high pH is not nearly as much of a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: as an excessively low pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put a plant in a pH of eight
versus a plant in a pH of 4.5,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that goes into the, the soil
with a pH of 4.5 is going to be much worse
[SPEAKER_01]: off, much, much worse off.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil pH is 8.2 and you should see the
explosive growth on my peach trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in the West again, the arid West
that hasn't had, you know, thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: inches, tens of thousands, millions of
inches of rainfall over the last several
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand years, those minerals levels are
just so high that it pushes the pH up and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, we can't unfortunately adjust the pH
of our soil very easily because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: just huge amounts of free lime in the
soil, in the parent material of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would not recommend trying to reduce
your soil pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would simply, um, try to balance the,
the nutrients as well as possible and let
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant rise a sphere, acidify just that
tiny little area next to the root to make
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients available instead of trying to
acidify the bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed you mentioned the pH on the
soil report versus it also shows a pH on
[SPEAKER_03]: the saturated paste report.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, there's great, great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, the soil page is 8.6,
but then when you combine the soil with
[SPEAKER_01]: your irrigation water, which is what the
lab, you submitted some irrigation water,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously for the water test, but then the
lab used your irrigation water for the
[SPEAKER_01]: pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're trying to replicate what the
soil solution looks like after you
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though your, your water pH is
high, it actually dropped the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution pH because the soil is 8.6,
the water was 7.7 and the combination of
[SPEAKER_01]: the two is 7.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So believe it or not, your water,
your high pH water is actually slightly
[SPEAKER_01]: acidifying the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bringing that down so that the plant
roots don't actually see 8.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see 7.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I said, I wouldn't recommend
acidifying your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still wouldn't, but if you did,
it would help theoretically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were really trying to optimize,
if you were like, if you had like a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred acres of premium fruit or
medicinal plants or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you were really trying to optimize
your growth, I would say, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: acidification with a sulfur burner would
totally help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on a small scale, I don't think there
would be much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it would be a huge pain in the
butt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, your plant roots are swimming in
7.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, because they combine the
irrigation water with your soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing that's high on the pace
report is sodium, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, it's sort of reflecting
that high sodium in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your sodium on the pace report is 56
parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, your potassium is only
six parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would expect, if you didn't amend
your soil, your plants would show pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: acute potassium deficiency and potentially
magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is, actually, I think
magnesium's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 30 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I say that is because if
you jump down on the pace report to the
[SPEAKER_01]: percentages, calcium is 43% of the soil
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like 40 to 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally higher is better, but I don't
think your plants are gonna have calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: acute calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magnesium is 28%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like magnesium to be like 20% of the
soil solution, and you're at 28%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the magnesium in the soil and the
magnesium from the water, from a balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint, is sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then the next two are where the
problem lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is 1.7% on the pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 1.7% of the soil solution is potassium,
and 27% is sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medicinal plants that we've talked about
before, I generally see potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: what growers call lockout, but what I call
antagonisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, potassium nutrients and
potassium deficiency visually manifest
[SPEAKER_01]: when that percentage of sodium goes above
the percent potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, you're not even close.
[SPEAKER_01]: That sodium is so much higher than the
potassium that I would bet money that
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants would struggle, and you would
see weird symptoms that maybe look like
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium deficiency, but oftentimes just
look hard to identify visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that sodium blocking the uptake
of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your case, I think a large compost
application will really push potassium up,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot of potassium in
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also be ready to feed
potassium, and I like organically there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a product called potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not carbon-based, but it is allowed
in organic production, and that'll really
[SPEAKER_01]: push up soluble potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll move that percentage toward
potassium and away from sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not removing sodium,
you're just adding more potassium to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of balance the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I guess the takeaway here
is just apply huge amounts of compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: retest, because it's hard to be precise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think what you need to be aware
of is having an additional nitrogen source
[SPEAKER_01]: on hand if that compost doesn't provide
the nitrogen you need, and your plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: hungry or you retest and it's still low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think having any kind of nitrogen meal,
so alfalfa meal, soybean meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal, feather meal, just whatever
you want to use, whatever your preference
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could use like a liquid nitrogen,
like liquid fish hydrolysate, or any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of powdered soluble nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just have that ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an important tool in the
toolbox for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would also have a small amount of
potassium sulfate ready, because if that
[SPEAKER_01]: compost doesn't provide enough potassium
or the sodium keeps accumulating over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, you might need to keep chasing
balance by applying potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, I wouldn't necessarily,
oh, and the bone meals, that's right,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's pre-plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And otherwise, I'd say like, see what the
compost, a large compost application does
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, zinc and copper are both low,
iron's low, manganese is low, a balanced
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient blend might really benefit
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think those, again, you might get
that through the compost, so I would wait
[SPEAKER_01]: and see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, one of the things on here that we
didn't talk about is silicon, and silica
[SPEAKER_03]: is a non-essential element for medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it's essential in some plants,
I believe it's horsetails, if I remember
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly, it is an essential element.
[SPEAKER_03]: But generally for a lot of plants,
I believe it's a non-essential element.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this percent here says, well,
it says 29.3 on the report.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a high number?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a low number?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so silica is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, technically it's not essential,
but it's so beneficial that it should be
[SPEAKER_01]: thought of as an essential nutrient for
all the plants we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it increases abiotic stress
resistance, it strengthens cell walls,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just has like a weird almost
bio-stimulating effect on yield and plant
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally speaking, silica applications
are always gonna be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I don't love the silica number
on a standard soil test is I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that silica is plants available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially that acidic soil extractant
is just kind of dissolving some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, and the silica, I mean, rocks are
made out of silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that's just kind of like,
it's hard to know if it's actually plant
[SPEAKER_01]: available or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to answer your question, 29 ppm is a
quite high number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have really good silica in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether or not it's plant available,
hard to know, especially at your high pH
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the pH was a little lower, I do think a
lot more of it would be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think that in theory, biology over
time, soil microbes should be mineralizing
[SPEAKER_01]: that into availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I wouldn't apply any more
silica, because it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important for commercial
cultivators to think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the best way, I guess I'll add
one more thing, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your soil, like my soil, the numbers
are kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, extremely high pH, the total
exchange capacity is like false,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what it's doing is it's just
looking at all that free lime in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this huge amount of calcium in
the soil, tons in the water, large amounts
[SPEAKER_01]: of sodium, really low micronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is just like wonky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing you can do, in my
opinion, is that you're never going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: a balanced soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to like have the
picture perfect soil report, which is OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's not the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing you can do is tissue
test a plant, whatever your highest value
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're like, you're going to focus
on tomatoes this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would send a tissue test of the leaves
of the tomato plant to the lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order these on my website and see
what the plant is actually uptaking and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if it's getting enough calcium and
enough magnesium and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would manage your nutrients more
based on what you're seeing on tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: tests rather than soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always think it's good to do
pre-plant amendments based on the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's often helpful to just ask
the plant what it needs more of and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of guide your amendments, your top
dressing, your feeds based on tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soil tests and tissue tests are
generally pretty well correlated in,
[SPEAKER_01]: let me just say, normal soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our soils that you and I are
growing in, it gets weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, last year, my plants
didn't have enough calcium, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: like your soil tests showed enormous
amounts of calcium in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just because we're dealing with
these very strange desert soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to negate the power of
soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to discount the
usefulness of this test in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, when things get
weird, test the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one more question here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I know some people will actually
add in, when they're trying to revive
[SPEAKER_03]: their soil, add in like a peat or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people add in like aeration.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know the folks will actually also
inoculate with microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed we didn't talk about any of that
here in this particular case.
[SPEAKER_03]: So would you advise against adding in
peat, for example, or some form of
[SPEAKER_03]: aeration, whether it be perlite or any of
the other aeration points and then
[SPEAKER_03]: inoculating with microbes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed you didn't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are two other... Yeah,
so I mean, the reason we haven't talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about it is because we're looking at a
soil nutrients analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of those things will change the
nutrients or balance the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not to say that they're not
important or recommended.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about peat and aggregates
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those change the physical properties of
the soil, not that they're inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemically, they have very little
influence on the soil chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're applying on the
topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not providing nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And peat might have a light downward
pressure on the pH, but in your soil won't
[SPEAKER_01]: do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The purpose of them is to improve the
structure, the aeration capabilities of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil and the drainage capacity and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in certain instances, in your case,
this may be one, like just getting a
[SPEAKER_01]: better physical health may be very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may benefit the plants
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, peat moss, it's kind of a
double-edged sword because on the one
[SPEAKER_01]: hand, peat bogs are a big impact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we use peat moss, we just need to
be aware that that's a resource in someone
[SPEAKER_01]: else's backyard that we're mining and it
has an impact, but it performs extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to loosen the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss has this interesting
characteristic where it both kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: loosens and aerates the soil, but it also
holds water well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why peat moss works so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So incorporating things like that in a
topsoil really in a small environment can
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get larger than even a few
hundred square feet, it gets very
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive for the benefit you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't generally recommend adding
aggregate to a topsoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say carbon-based aeration sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cocoa and peat are much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I've ever heard anything
about aeration is in an engineered media,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a peat-based potting soil for indoor
production or when you're growing in pots
[SPEAKER_01]: or raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to microbes, the role of
microbes is to cycle nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_01]: already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, I have a philosophy that if
you use carbon-based inputs and you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: living roots and you irrigate really well,
it keeps consistent soil moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you feed, you have a consistent flow
of carbon through your soil system in all
[SPEAKER_01]: different forms from molasses to wood
chips and everything in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time, the microbial community can get
very healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I inoculate at planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every plant I put in the ground,
I do a dry pelleted mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inoculant and a root dip in a full
spectrum bacterial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just let the indigenous
microorganisms sort of run their course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just try to feed cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I irrigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do all the things I can to just feed the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my only inoculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But people do it different.
[SPEAKER_01]: People brew teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will create ferments, which is
really sort of you're getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial byproducts more than the
microbes themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, you can kind of be
pushing microbes through the season,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's definitely going to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: But long term, I think the best thing you
can do is just treat your soil well and
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly be feeding carbon sources into
your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you taking the time today to
go over the water test and soil test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can find me first and foremost
on my website, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: soildoctorconsulting.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I offer is on there,
testing, online courses, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on and off of Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Instagram handle is soil underscore
doctor, where I put out short nerdy videos
[SPEAKER_01]: about soil and different farming practices
and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the busy growing season,
I don't really produce much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the winter, I generally put out a
lot of my learnings for the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram, and I would just recommend,
no matter the size, if anyone's interested
[SPEAKER_01]: in getting a soil test, it's like,
get your soil tested or get a single
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue test or a water test after this
conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can order them all on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I work with growers of all sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a pretty low investment to
really understand the most important thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about your production in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just push people to my website
to check out the offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're interested, reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll definitely have a link down in
the description section below so you can
[SPEAKER_03]: easily get to his website.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you haven't tuned into that
previous episode we did together,
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely tune into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have that link down in the YouTube
description section below as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you can just search for it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just type in soil doctor and Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it should pop right up, should be the
first result or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian, thanks so much once again for
coming on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been very insightful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned so much from this and I'm
feeling a lot of my audience has learned
[SPEAKER_03]: from this as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate you taking the time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Chris, thanks for inviting me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun to look at your soil and your
water over in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.
