[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 131.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Brandon
Hudson.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an agronomist for Kiss Organics and
has been gardening for nearly 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over that span of time, Brandon has done a
countless number of gardening methods and
[SPEAKER_00]: has identified many gardening myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about a variety of things in this
episode, revealing both good information
[SPEAKER_00]: and some bro science that he has
encountered along the way.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Brandon Hudson.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great to be here, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met you at the Soil Life Summit in
Perump, Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a talk there and I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of knowledge that you have is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've been gardening medicinal
plants for 39 years now and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge that you have, I can only
imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm super excited to have you on here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a variety of different things
that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That talk you did at the Soil Life Summit
towards the end, you did like a myth
[SPEAKER_00]: busting type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just brought out so many good
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought doing something similar to
that here would be very valuable to my
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we start off, can you just tell us a
little bit about yourself and how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great to meet you at Soil Summit
and I'm very honored.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very kind of you to say all that
and very humbled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really great experience and met a
lot of really wonderful people and got to
[SPEAKER_02]: meet a lot of people like yourself who
I've been following and just never had the
[SPEAKER_02]: chance to meet in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm Brandon Hudson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the agronomist for Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the bulk of the soil and water
analysis and I'm the, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: resident grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing longer than anybody
else.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be my 39th year of this specific
plant in May.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here in a month or two, I'll hit my
39th year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've killed a lot of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've learned a lot along the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been around plants my whole life.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom's the botanist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Her little sister ran Evergreen,
which is the Carter family folds nursery
[SPEAKER_02]: in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents had a friend, Stewart,
who threw a night blooming series party
[SPEAKER_02]: every year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've always had cool plant people
around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in the Smoky Mountains,
just outside of Knoxville, Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's until I came to Washington
State, I would have said it's the most
[SPEAKER_02]: lush place on the planet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say Washington is now that I'm
here, but just growing up in a place that
[SPEAKER_02]: had ferns as big as me, stuff that made
you, you wouldn't have been surprised if a
[SPEAKER_02]: dinosaur walked out of those woods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just those plants, just, I don't know,
there's something about the plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: just captured my imagination as a kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something really special about the
custodial responsibility of caretaking for
[SPEAKER_02]: life.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this plant and regardless of
its, I've got a begonia addiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got, for the people that can't see,
I've got this, my little pet monstera,
[SPEAKER_02]: albog monstera behind me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to grow cactus and succulents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the biggest flower guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like really simple flowers, like on
begonias and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I just love plants and growing
satisfies, I have a very curious brain and
[SPEAKER_02]: I love math and I love chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm fortunate to have figured that out
as a really young person, that that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: nice, there's something that it does
really nice for my brain to work on math
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I figured out that chemistry grew
plants, I was onto something and I really
[SPEAKER_02]: fell in love with the whole process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm kind of a mathletic nerd,
my mom calls me mathletic, but I love the
[SPEAKER_02]: art side of growing as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely a science, but there's
definitely an art when we talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: watering and just observation of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's very humbling to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's exercise and patience.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite forced
meditations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I feel very fortunate to have
plants in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the act of growing is really
important just for me mentally,
[SPEAKER_02]: just to be happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we shared that same passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when did you get involved with KISS
Organics?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a facility, I had a hemp facility
in Charleston, South Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: And founded that with a couple of other
guys I'd known for a really long time,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of them for almost 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we founded this facility and we found
ourselves having to do some pivots really
[SPEAKER_02]: fast because in South Carolina,
we could produce flower, but we couldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: They changed the law after we built the
baseball field, you know, build it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they will come.
[SPEAKER_02]: We build it and then they changed the law
to where we could not sell finished
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that obviously required a pivot,
you know, as far as the business model.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we moved to a nursery space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we were working with a lot of
HBCUs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a minority owned company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was the only white person
involved with the founding of the company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we got involved with a bunch of
HBCUs, historically black colleges and
[SPEAKER_02]: universities in the southeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started doing the propagation
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they are doing, you know,
now that, you know, prohibition is kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: slipping off, you know, universities
wanted to get into the research game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of federal money and
especially like during COVID.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we started working with these
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that was no longer sustainable
and that farm shut down, a really good
[SPEAKER_02]: friend of mine and Tad's a mutual friend
of ours, Justin McGill, Mako Farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: who's been on the Kiss podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really amazing grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he has his environmental style
better than anybody I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just top shelf grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're all buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know Tad well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew Tad, I guess, professionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd reached out to Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple of times just because of my farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was always really great about
picking up the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: He always made himself accessible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Justin and I just became good friends
through other channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he told Tad that I was looking for a
job.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tad said, what's Brandon do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And Justin said he does soil reports.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I did a little tryout soil report
for Justin and Tad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad liked the cut of my jib.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here we are a couple of years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really proud to be on the Kiss
team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found Tad through the soil food web
folks, Elaine Ingham and Leon Hussey,
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad's dad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was one of Elaine's advisors on compost
in the beginning days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've got manuscripts of Jeff
Lowenfels here at the house because Tad's
[SPEAKER_02]: parents used to live in this house with
Tad's dad's notes in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's just a lot of history with
Kiss with organics and compost and compost
[SPEAKER_02]: teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I heard Tad do a webinar conversation
with a bunch of folks where he gave a talk
[SPEAKER_02]: and he said actionable data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, I got to find this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was the first person that was talking
about metrics and targets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've got 19 years of salt and 20 years
of organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I spent at least 10 years just
throwing every penny I had and every
[SPEAKER_02]: amendment I could at the wall trying to
see what would stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then really just kind of circled back
and started trying to apply what I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: about chemical fertilizers and driving
growth with organics through a more
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted method.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I found Tad, I was like,
this guy's speaking my language.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to find this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I feel really lucky to be there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm an integral part of the
Kiss team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do the soil analysis, the water
analysis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I helped Tad with hosting our book clubs
and our hangouts and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And got to travel with Kiss, Tad and Dr.
Ben Higgins to Soil Summit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, it's a wonderful group of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a small team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I can't say enough good things
about the folks I work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the really wonderful things
I've got going on in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I met Tad at the Soil Summit and
great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had him on this podcast twice now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he just came back for a second time
pretty recently here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was at the Soil Summit talking
with him, he's just so friendly,
[SPEAKER_00]: so knowledgeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I was at his I was at the Kiss
booth for a little while and I was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: his ear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I had to get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be like, dude, I got to stop talking
ear off.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's just so easy to talk to and so
friendly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I can't say enough positive
words about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really cool that he's a
colleague of yours and you guys work
[SPEAKER_00]: closely together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that Tad is so willing to say he
doesn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's so willing to be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's provided a lot of space for me to
be wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the first time I'm an older
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been working since I was 15.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a lot of different jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This cultivation is the only thing I've
done the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the first time I've ever had a
job where it's OK for me to mess up as
[SPEAKER_02]: long as I don't do it again and I learn
something from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if I can mess up and learn
something that helps other growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fully supported in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a really that's a really
amazing space to work in.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I when we were doing some some
of the work in our hemp facility in South
[SPEAKER_02]: Carolina, we were working with some really
huge companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were doing some some really interesting
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could only take it so far,
though, because, you know, there were some
[SPEAKER_02]: some targets that people were hoping you
would hit, you know, and so it wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: driven scientifically, you know,
as much as, you know, they were really
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping this was going to pan out because
there'd be a financial reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm in a situation where I don't
have to provide any kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: economic impetus to do an experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just has to help another grower down
the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that whole mindset
continuous improvement and learning from
[SPEAKER_00]: your mistakes, I think that's a fantastic
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way I go about it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's get into some of these questions
that we have here for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of these questions that we have on
the list here are controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are things that we used to kind of
think were right, but may or may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just go one by one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with clones taking clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I remember back when I first started
growing back in 2010, I think 2011 is when
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually started reading Jorge Cervantes
book, The Grower's Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Jorge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things in his book he
mentioned when you take clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be taking them from the bottom
part of the plant because it'll give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher chance of rooting due to the
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that we've learned quite a bit
since that book was released in 2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does taking clones from the bottom part of
the plant have a higher chance of rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the hormones?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing I want to say,
the disclaimer here is even diffusion is a
[SPEAKER_02]: theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a theory.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a real quick segue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was a TED talk I saw where a guy
got up and said, everybody raise your hand
[SPEAKER_02]: if you know something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody in the room raised their
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he picked on somebody in the front
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll just call him Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, OK, so what do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, I know my name's Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, OK, how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, it's on my driver's
license, my Social Security card,
[SPEAKER_02]: my birth certificate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what my parents call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what my wife calls me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, OK, well, he's got reliable
witnesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got documentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be pretty confident that he's Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, what else do you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, I know the earth
travels around the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, does everybody agree that
the earth travels around the sun and
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody did?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, but how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever done the experiment
yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you just confident?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with all these myth things that
we're going to touch on today,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want people to take the big takeaway is
use critical thinking, keep an open mind,
[SPEAKER_02]: covariance, covariance, and covariance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many other these are open
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even when we are trying to control for
one toggle switch to flip, there's other
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are getting flipped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing happens in a vacuum in those
rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so rather than people arguing,
let's move the conversations forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be productive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's help each other as you know,
I've been growing this amazing plant for
[SPEAKER_02]: 39 years and for 38.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been able to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, the fact that we can share
it, we should all just be, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we should be so excited to help each other
and share, you know, humans like to be on
[SPEAKER_02]: teams.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just part of our DNA.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but in this, this could be one big
team and it would be really awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer the question about the the
propagation, and I feel like, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was doing 20 to 40,000 cuts at a time
for those HBC use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've definitely had statistically
relevant sample size and I feel very you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's something I know, because I've
done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done the experiment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done 80,000 cuts in a year,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so taking clones from the top and the
bottom of the plant does not matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hormones don't load differently as far
as the rooting hormones in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't get better success using the top
or the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can take clones from and I have
from every part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a great example of people having
accurate data that's not good data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is this this what the
white paper that people cite for this that
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to take it from a certain part of
the plant is accurate data, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for a different plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with that plant, yes, you do get
better success, you know, taking your
[SPEAKER_02]: clones from one area of the plant versus
another because you do get a different
[SPEAKER_02]: hormone load.
[SPEAKER_02]: This plant, it's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's that's one that people can,
you know, confidently, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: do their propagation from top bottom of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more important to,
you know, the things that are important
[SPEAKER_02]: are rotating those moms every six months,
making sure those moms are healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, IPM,
you know, getting getting something in
[SPEAKER_02]: there so that you don't get a week eight
fusarium explosion, making sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're testing root stock or HPLVD with,
you know, sufficiently old enough,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, root stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: That stuff's way more important.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as propagation, you can
confidently take clones from anywhere on
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing would just be to manage the
health of that canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't want to over trim a
plant or you know, cut someplace where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not a, you know, a node for growth
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you speak about roots and I want to
actually dive into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: White fuzzy roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you had talked
about during your talk at the Soil Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: White fuzzy roots, we usually determine
that as being health, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy roots when they're white,
fuzzy, although that actually isn't the
[SPEAKER_00]: case or may not be the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this is just a kind of like a fun
little anecdotal one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't there's not really anything
to be done about it.
But.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you see, you know, everybody,
everybody who takes clones, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: something magical when you see those
bright white roots finally break out of
[SPEAKER_02]: your substrate or your cubes or whatever
it is you're you're doing your propagation
[SPEAKER_02]: in sand, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that we know from flora culture
world, is that when you've got,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a little white rootlet pop
popping out of the side of your pod and
[SPEAKER_02]: then all of a sudden you get all these
like little furry, they're just more root
[SPEAKER_02]: hairs coming off of that same root that
that's that's a good healthy root.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mean that it's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that that roots not
healthy, but what that root is doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: that root is adding, you know,
instead of having like this root.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's got this root.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's added all this surface area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what that is, is showing you that
the not that the roots not healthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the plant is seeking specifically
phosphorus and I think iron.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is that plant is is that's a
morphological response to that plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing it doesn't have enough of a
specific nutrient.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's nothing wrong with the
root.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing to be worried about there,
but it just means it's time to get those
[SPEAKER_02]: podded up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's just an interesting one
where, you know, we just apply critical
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we love this plant so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a special plant and it's
incredibly special and important to me in
[SPEAKER_02]: so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to remember that the plant,
it's got its own biological mission that
[SPEAKER_02]: has nothing to do with Chris, nothing to
do with Brandon.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wants to reproduce and have a,
you know, another generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the plant is going to do what the
plant needs to do to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of that ends up being beneficial for
us, but that's just secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so something like that, the root
putting on more surface area is just a
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice place where people can kind of
think about what the plant needs and what
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, there's nothing wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying if you walked into
somebody's clone propagation room,
[SPEAKER_02]: if they've got fuzzy roots, I'm not
knocking that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what it's telling you is it's time to
go ahead and probably get those,
[SPEAKER_02]: either get them some nutrients or get them
potted up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, covariance, you know,
it could be a combination of nutrient and
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD, but all the white papers,
all the research show that that is the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant looking to mine phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing that people deem as
being a good thing, which may actually
[SPEAKER_00]: indicate the plant needs something is
leaves praying to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is a hot topic that Tad Hussie
had actually created an Instagram video
[SPEAKER_00]: on, it just blew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get your thoughts on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the leaves praying
to the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a good thing or could there
potentially be something wrong with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: So praying leaves is one that will really,
people feel very, very strongly about
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would challenge people to challenge
their biases.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's absolutely no reason to
run off into the sunset and marry your
[SPEAKER_02]: bias.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it doesn't, you know,
there's a great interview with Muhammad
[SPEAKER_02]: Ali where a guy is kind of challenging him
on something he had said as a young person
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 years before that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And rather than, you know, dignify the
question, Ali just responded by,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think a man that hasn't grown
in 30 years, that would be a, that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be a waste of a life, wouldn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically was saying, allow me to
grow, allow me to be a different person
[SPEAKER_02]: than I was 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we should be able to evolve in our
understanding of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes, again, this is the most
important one for covariance.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many factors that affect leaf
angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about leaf angle and we're
talking about plants praying hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so water accumulation is one reason
for leaf angle, nutrient loads in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, CO2 levels, light, both the amount
of light and the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right there you have covariance just in
the same measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different things going on
with leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and like, and if you go
through and read all the white papers,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's really funny because you'll have
these really intelligent science
[SPEAKER_02]: scientists, because I'm an NPK guy,
you know, I don't study leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I go find somebody that's, you know,
devoted their life to studying leaf angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really funny because those guys
will go through all these different
[SPEAKER_02]: covariance and then they'll say,
it's so complicated that it's not really
[SPEAKER_02]: even worth studying.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so this is something they spent
their whole life studying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of it is that all these research
that we're looking at for leaf angle in
[SPEAKER_02]: this being an optimal leaf angle is
monocots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it's grasses and cereals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you and I are growing wheat,
man, it would be great to get plants with
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, a genetically predisposed
leaf angle, because that's part of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, is genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's another covariant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf's ability to capture light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, like if if you've got
too much light, it would make sense that
[SPEAKER_02]: your leaf angle would turn up and so it's
going to catch less light.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we see praying hard and we see flat
leaves with the same PPFD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is it just the light load?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it maybe the light load and the fact
that CO2 is low?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you get this rigid turgor to the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that forces the stomata to be open.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the answer to this one is
that we don't definitively know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows definitively.
[SPEAKER_02]: The researchers are all open to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if people who, you know,
who and I'm not saying that you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a doctorate to speak on something,
but if people have spent an extra six
[SPEAKER_02]: years of school just to just to go down
that rabbit hole for you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's you know, and that might be a good
segue to talk about white ash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are there is somebody out there
who spent their life studying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, if I've got a pathology
issue, I'm going to reach out to Chris
[SPEAKER_02]: Pays and Michael Brownbridge at BioWorks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Cornell Ag Department.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to beat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I've got a pest problem,
I'm reaching out to Suzanne Wainwright
[SPEAKER_02]: Evans.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's she's had her own company,
not just been an entomologist,
[SPEAKER_02]: but she's had her own company for 30
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's seen it all, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always just try to reach out to
the people who are you know, up the food
[SPEAKER_02]: chain for me in whatever particular area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't go to forums a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to traditional ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not like soybean and corn
and tobacco have it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've got hundreds of years of
research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to reinvent the wheel with
this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some peculiar things that we have
to do as far as, you know, protecting
[SPEAKER_02]: those flowers from moisture and that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as driving evapotranspiration,
driving morphology, generative or
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetative steering, we know how to do
that, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as the leaf angle thing goes,
in my opinion, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, it it's something that we
can't nobody can definitively say.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nobody that has got the research
to definitively say this is replicable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do this parameter matched with this
parameter every single time I get this
[SPEAKER_02]: praying leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until we have that, nobody can say
definitively.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem to be tied to covariance.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to be difficult to get to to
happen moving one toggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does seem to be a symptom of some sort
of stress because we don't see these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a in a monocrop field in nature,
we don't see it typically happening day in
[SPEAKER_02]: and day out in a big monocrop greenhouse
or in a grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we see these, you know,
we see these different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: environments hitting similar metrics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not replicable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it does seem to be a stress
symptom, but it doesn't seem to be
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that, you know, I would be
particularly concerned about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would be more concerned if my
harvest metrics were off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be more concerned if my terpene
expression or my trichome development
[SPEAKER_02]: wasn't where it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be more concerned if, you know,
I saw some sort of visual deficiency or
[SPEAKER_02]: morphology change.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and so it's cool to go down
these rabbit holes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, you know,
I don't I definitely don't think it's this
[SPEAKER_02]: one's worth fighting about like this white
ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might I might meet you outside about
white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as this one, I just don't see
why people would want to fight about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, white ash makes sense to me,
why people would fight about it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's a there's a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, in the end user market,
there is an economic advantage to having
[SPEAKER_02]: white ash in the same way there's economic
advantage to having like a single note,
[SPEAKER_02]: really high THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, you know, as adults, we all know
that that that there's a lot more complex
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences to be had as opposed to just a
single note THC experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I understand why people double down
any time there's a monetized message.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's easy to double down
because if you don't, it affects your
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, in that same vein,
I like to tread lightly.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those areas, I don't want to hurt
people's feelings or get people mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: But white ash has been studied for
hundreds of years, you know, by the
[SPEAKER_02]: tobacco industry, by by by wildlife
management, by your local fire department.
[SPEAKER_02]: I reached out to a pyrologist because this
is a question I get all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had I had an opinion about it,
but I'm not a pyrologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and so I reached out to
somebody who is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he explained that, yeah, the only
reason you're getting black ash is because
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon and it's not fully combusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can there's different things,
whether it's resin, primarily the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: content of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things are, you know, the puff
volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like so, you know, tobacco knows that.
[SPEAKER_02]: A the burn rate and the burn temperature
of a cigarette is very complex,
[SPEAKER_02]: just like growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an open system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different things that
affect that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, again, is it covariance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily, because I can take the
worst product you've ever seen in your
[SPEAKER_02]: life and get it bone dry and it'll burn
white.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can also give you the best product
you've ever seen in your life that's got a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of moisture left into it,
which is honestly my preference,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I feel like it's a little
smoother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll get salt and pepper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so should we be evaluating the quality
or the value of that flower based on white
[SPEAKER_02]: ash?
[SPEAKER_02]: To me is kind of like determining the
qualitative, you know, a measure of your
[SPEAKER_02]: dinner by looking in the toilet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It it's kind of irrelevant to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and we know that, you know,
from tobacco, yeah, you can spray a
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarette with potassium acetate or
magnesium acetate and it will burn white.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because there's more potassium in
that tobacco plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you've sprayed a chemical
accelerant onto the cigarette.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want chemical accelerants sprayed
onto anything that I'm using.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't want it on my clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it in my food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you also, you know, when folks say
that it's too much or too little of
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you know, plants that aren't
flushed enough, like that's not that's not
[SPEAKER_02]: the answer for sure, because all those
other minerals, they burn white when they
[SPEAKER_02]: burn fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: They burn white.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not too much of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, as far as not being
enough of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to force a plant to take
up luxury amounts of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium or manganese so that it gets
white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to that biological objective
of the plant conversation, like the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant's not trying to get white ash,
you know, so it's not going to take up
[SPEAKER_02]: extra an extra amount of some element that
you could spray on to the to the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and I will say, and here's where
it gets a little interesting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does a little curve ball because I have
noticed and I've worked with a grower in
[SPEAKER_02]: Los Angeles for about a year and a half on
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants white ash because he can drive a
better dollar for for his his work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the things that he was
having issues with, aside from that,
[SPEAKER_02]: was high chlorides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so he was getting lockouts and trace
elements at the top of his plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I immediately was like, let's look at
your chlorides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure enough, they were high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got his chlorides down and all of a
sudden he started getting white ash
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorides do not fully combust at any
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the theory that I'm working on here
is that perhaps high chlorides could could
[SPEAKER_02]: be an elemental where, you know,
where it doesn't make sense for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the other elements as to why that would
have any impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chlorides actually does make make sense
that if you're up taking a lot of chloride
[SPEAKER_02]: into your plant, you could potentially end
up with with a, you know, a factor that
[SPEAKER_02]: would make it impossible for you to have
white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so here it is something I thought I
understood from fully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understood it a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got past the whole,
you know, that first step and was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, we understand that now, but here's
another curve ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's so it's it's I
can't help a grower if I don't keep an
[SPEAKER_02]: open mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I saw that relationship and
that was a thing that he was chasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're able to repeat this over and
over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we are onto something here,
you know, so one I don't want,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, at the end of the day,
I don't think again, this is not worth
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making more money that way,
yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I it's for me, it's not how I would
judge somebody's I wouldn't judge a grower
[SPEAKER_02]: by white ash and I wouldn't judge a flower
by white ash ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think the chloride thing is
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's worth investigating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got into the white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thing because that is a hot topic and the
leaves praying to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the leaf positioning is another
interesting thing, which really makes me
[SPEAKER_00]: open up my mind because I've always been
told, hey, if the leaves are praying to
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, that means you're doing things
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means the plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have everything they need in order to
grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hearing that, hey, I actually might be
a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to take a step back and say,
OK, that's it could actually be something
[SPEAKER_00]: a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you mentioned, it's probably just
not worth the energy to try to really
[SPEAKER_00]: figure it out because there's there's so
many variables, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like trying to adjust the leaves so
they are praying or not praying.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just you got bigger things to worry
about in the grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I walk in my room and my leaves aren't
praying, no alarm bells go off at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, it could be VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be, you know, it could be so many
things and it could be the
[SPEAKER_02]: interrelationships of all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's it's it's infinitely
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the reasons I love to grow
plants is you'll never master it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm never going to understand this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If somehow I could magically understand
everything I needed to know about NPK,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd still have to know lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd still have to know water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd still have to know environmental.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd still have to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just never stops, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's infinite room.
[SPEAKER_02]: To learn and we all learn better when
we're not when we're doing this,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we're sharing instead of,
you know, if you plant a flag,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you got to be right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not interested in being
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I'm interested in that kaizen of
gradual improvement, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but consistent improvement, gradual but
consistent improvement.
[SPEAKER_00]: The continuous learning is what makes it
fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that's one reason that
really makes it fun is being able to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: new things and try new methods and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: From this and get into hollow stems next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is another thing that you had
talked about in your talk at the Soil
[SPEAKER_00]: Summit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollow stems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some stems are hollow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about hollow stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is another one kind of like the
cloning one where there's a white paper
[SPEAKER_02]: that I, you know, people it's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I answer the phones at Kiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: I answer a lot of the grower questions at
Kiss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'll get an email on Monday morning
that's essentially hey, hollow stems are
[SPEAKER_02]: this want to fight about it kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, I don't want to fight
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what I understand about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I ask for any time,
you know, I'm on one side or the other of
[SPEAKER_02]: a conversation with somebody is I ask them
for the, you know, where did they get
[SPEAKER_02]: their data?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did they, you know, what are they
basing that's on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it experiential?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not knocking experiential.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a hundred years ago,
we didn't have necessarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of scientists were hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a hobby for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They might be a mailman and they come home
and look at the stars at night and they
[SPEAKER_02]: figured something out or they're,
you know, they have a greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_02]: they, you know, work on orchids on the
weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, and so experience is how
you get to the math side where you can
[SPEAKER_02]: start to prove something, you know,
to yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how do I know this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and if you can replicate
it, hollow stems in plants that don't
[SPEAKER_02]: normally exhibit a hollow stem,
it can be a deficiency or a disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it happens in brassicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So broccoli, it's very common.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I think it's calcium and boron.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of blanking right now,
so don't quote me on that, but I think
[SPEAKER_02]: it's calcium and boron in brassicas that
creates that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the paper that people cite for this
plant is based off of brassicas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, again, it's accurate for that
plant, but not for this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this plant can exhibit either a
pithy solid stem or a hollow stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time it's pithy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so people get really worried about
hollow stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also get really worried about hollow
stems when they're doing propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: One clue when I was younger about hollow
stems was, you know, one, I always had
[SPEAKER_02]: really good propagation rates no matter
what.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought, you know, I knew a plant wasn't
a straw, but it was still, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That I was still getting this good germ
rates, but I was only seeing it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rarely saw it indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had some people,
you know, really want to get to the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with this plant, it's temperature
regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having that hollow stem enables the
plant to more efficiently, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so air changes temperature much faster
than water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I get these increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, cool days out here in the Puget
Sound, because I'm surrounded by cool
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when it's 100 in Seattle,
it's maybe 78, 80 degrees out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if there's air in that stem,
that plant can very rapidly change
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature compared to if there was
holding a bunch of water in there with all
[SPEAKER_02]: this pith and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I read that explanation,
that seemed to make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that, you know,
checked all the boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, based off,
again, I'm an NPK guy, but that's based
[SPEAKER_02]: off of, you know, research done by some
really smart people who are very
[SPEAKER_02]: qualified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, I would like to talk about yugal
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this is something that I am going to
actually utilize myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't yet, but basically what this is
in layman's terms is digging a hole or
[SPEAKER_00]: filling your raised beds with wood first,
then putting your soil over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, planting your plants
in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm about to actually assemble several
raised beds in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved into a new house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm going to do raised beds and
then also instead of just having a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent soil in order to save some money,
especially about the taller raised beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fill it with wood first, then put your
soil over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Common method.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pros, but there's also cons to
this method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break down the pros and cons to
this for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm a big fan of yugal culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in East Tennessee and,
you know, every house is on an angle like
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you, if you miss a basketball
shot in East Tennessee, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 minutes to get the ball back,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's so like, you should have
swales.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, terraces or something is a
really important physical aspect of
[SPEAKER_02]: growing with the, you know, a challenge
like that when you've got an incline like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yugal culture is great for that
because it's the natural swale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yugal culture is great because all that
wood provides, as it breaks down,
[SPEAKER_02]: will provide a nice solid structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you can basically just use,
open the top of that up and use it like a
[SPEAKER_02]: raised bed for, you know, forever without
having to build a bed, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we worry a lot especially with this
plant, with the laws around it as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: the testing is concerned for heavy metals
and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that eliminates all those questions
about, can I use this cinder block?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I use this wood that may or may not
have been treated with, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: lead arsenic or, you know, whatever,
I don't know, mercury or arsenic to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve wood or things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a bunch of advantages to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great in that you're usually,
you know, at least you're being encouraged
[SPEAKER_02]: to use materials gathered locally,
keeping that carbon footprint down,
[SPEAKER_02]: preferably, you know, off of your
property.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we do what we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Downside of yugal culture is, and really
the only downside to it, to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that a lot of people a lot of growers
don't realize that the bacteria in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, it's got its own biological mission.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things it likes in order to
complete that mission is a certain carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: to nitrogen ratio in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you think carbon, you think
wood as a source.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you've got this big bag and you
fill it up this high, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this full with wood and then you put your
your nitrates, your greens, your compost,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever on top soil even.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you've done is you've you've messed
up the carbon to nitrogen ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so instead of that preferred 18 to one
or lower, you've got this crazy high
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon to nitrogen ratio in the bacteria
in the soil insists on being 18 to one or
[SPEAKER_02]: lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not it's not a debate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not going to talk to you about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't change their mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, in the same way that like people
worry about fungal or bacterially
[SPEAKER_02]: dominated teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first got into the soil food web
stuff, I was really, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I realized, oh, you know,
again, evolving, learning more is no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter what I do to that tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could hit whatever ratio, you know,
magically somebody wants, let's say once
[SPEAKER_02]: it hits that soil, there's certain
equilibriums that the soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: biology is going to create.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you if you load up a bunch of wood,
I just did it to myself this past year,
[SPEAKER_02]: I put in a five foot by 52 foot bed and
one end of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tad's dad came out here and did it did
some digging with the tractor for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was my mess up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a bunch of wood chips in front of
the pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one in just like a little three
foot section.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing grew in it last year because the
bio the bacteria is going to use your
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrates as an energy source.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the big takeaway is going to use
the the nitrates as an energy source to
[SPEAKER_02]: break down that carbon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it will not release it to your
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so by me getting all those wood chips
into that end of the pile, I or the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: my bed, nothing grew in that little three
foot section.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's it's super easy to fix.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to add nitrates
throughout the season just consistently
[SPEAKER_02]: and constantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just, you know, you can build your
hugelkultur mounds and you can give them a
[SPEAKER_02]: year and you can let the bacteria do what
it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can grow, you know,
after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not homogenous, you know,
it's not like you've got wood,
[SPEAKER_02]: soil, wood, soil, wood, soil throughout
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not as it's not super homogenous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this top layer will act as a kind
of a separate bed to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where it meets that wood layer,
there is going to be a lot of biology
[SPEAKER_02]: going on and it is going to mine for
nitrates in your soil to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just hate to see people give up on
hugelkultur because it is such a cool
[SPEAKER_02]: thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll call me and say, hey,
I did this and it's not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: My plants are all yellow and they're
dying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just, you know, tell them to add
nitrogen or wait till next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad I learned that because if
I didn't know that and I did hugelkultur
[SPEAKER_00]: and then saw a poor result, then I would
probably get pretty upset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing this information gives me a
little bit more confidence in doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you sharing that with us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we actually had a technical
difficulty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the new day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on Instagram as Tatusadu,
T-A-T-U-S-A-D-H-U.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a weird one, but people can find me
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also, you know, Kiss, we host a book
club.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing that tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every Tuesday, you know, always
growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm easy to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll definitely have a link too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brandon's Instagram as well as Kiss
Organic's website down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can easily navigate to it and give
them a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information on his Instagram
page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, thanks so much, Brandon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
