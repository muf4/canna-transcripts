[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the ParfectWorks RA-2000 LED
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: ParfectWorks sent me over this grow light
and in this video I'm going to unbox the
[SPEAKER_00]: unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to test the PAR output and I'm
also going to do a heat test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all the features
that this grow light has in this video but
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay here is the box and the first thing
out the box is a user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This user manual includes installation
instructions, recommended hanging heights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and information about daisy chaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next sheet is going to have some more
information on the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also includes some information on
another model that they sell the RA-1000
[SPEAKER_00]: and this sheet shows PAR test readings at
different heights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing out the box is a power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that is a pair of rope ratchet
hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a wire hanging kit and lastly is
the LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ-500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers and the measurements are in
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these videos just to give you a
general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements and grow tents which
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering coverage area for this grow
light is three feet by three feet and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: taking measurements in a four foot by four
foot grow tent so I'm going to try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: my PAR meter in a three foot by three foot
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the recommended hanging heights
listed in their user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 inches, 18 inches, and 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the grow light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 1.91 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 228 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
