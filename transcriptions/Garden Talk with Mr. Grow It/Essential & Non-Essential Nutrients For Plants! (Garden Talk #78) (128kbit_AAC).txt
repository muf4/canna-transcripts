[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been well documented that there are
92, maybe more naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: elements on Earth, wherein 82 of which
have been found in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant says, okay guys,
if you just give me a tiny bit of nickel
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little bit of biology, I can turn
your trash that you're giving me into
[SPEAKER_01]: something usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we always try to say it's 20% silt and
it's 10% clay and it's all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things creates a magnetic
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have biology, we talk about
your EC increasing because your biology
[SPEAKER_01]: and your magnetic charge and your magnet
gets stronger and stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll even start to see the atherocyanin,
it's the purple, starting to appear in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're not going to see is you'll
see a huge reduction in essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast.

episode number 28, and a countless number
[SPEAKER_00]: of you have requested for him to come back
for a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, he picks up right where
he left off, talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: essential nutrients for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also touches upon what deficiencies and
toxicities look like.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Mark from Perfect
Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for letting me come back
on the channel for part two, and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: also wanted to say thank you so much to
the community for asking for part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your second time on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time was a big success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lots of people in the comments
section demanding for that part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are, part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first episode we did together,
you talked about some of the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you also touched upon what
deficiencies and toxicities look like for
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered so many of these elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, potassium,
magnesium, iron, calcium, manganese,
[SPEAKER_00]: and copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got a whole bunch done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still a lot more to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark actually created a presentation for
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you'd like to follow along,
I'll put a link to the presentation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, find this episode on YouTube in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to access the link to the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show what I can on the screen this
time, but if there are any slides that
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube might not like, I'll leave those
ones out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's continue what we left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essential elements for plants,
part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you've snuck some
non-essential elements in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to see what you got in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll let you roll along with the
presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a little bit of an
introduction in there and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will help for those that didn't
catch the first episode we did together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Chris said, if you're not following
along, the description is down below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you put your email in, you're gonna get
three things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get the presentation,
you're gonna get a free visual plant
[SPEAKER_01]: guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something you can actually,
a lot of times you don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency name, but you know what you're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we did is we created a visual
plant guide so you can actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're seeing, you can reference it,
scroll over, and then see whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency of toxicity and most likely
what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, you're gonna receive a free
audio book all about minerals for plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and for the human body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanna do a special thanks to the Army of
Growers that have helped make this
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special thanks to Dave Hanson,
Ken, Hayes, Mike, Emily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emily actually helped create the visual
plant guide, so just special thanks to him
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avsai and the rest of the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Perfect Gardens culture, you've heard
me say this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vision, Canada farmers solving the
World Act problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is we are here to help you
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our values, our integrity, putting the
shopping cart back every time,
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability, doing our due diligence,
and being present.
[SPEAKER_01]: One problem, one solution at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are an Army of Growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is Perfect Gardens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect Gardens is a online retail store
and a growing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission is to help you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those ways is by using,
testing, and teaching you about products
[SPEAKER_01]: that will help create long-term
regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that 90% of the products sold in
most garden stores are just there to have
[SPEAKER_01]: you repurchase it the following year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout this presentation, we'll be
talking about a few brands we support.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not saying that you should purchase
these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are saying that you should look at the
raw materials of what these products are
[SPEAKER_01]: created from and then start there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope that by guiding you to purchase
high quality products, it will in one part
[SPEAKER_01]: help fulfill our mission here at Perfect
Gardens, which is to help you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we're gonna talk about the Law of
Minimum real quick one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna give some examples around
the Law of Minimum because I think by
[SPEAKER_01]: giving these examples in the beginning of
this presentation, it'll make the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the minerals as we go through them a lot
more efficient and easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Law of Minimum states that growth
is dictated not by the total resources
[SPEAKER_01]: available, but by the scarcest resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we'll be talking about the five
most limiting factors that support enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: 80% of the deficiencies, toxicities,
bugs, mold, low yield, and crappy quality
[SPEAKER_01]: are because of a lack of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those five most limiting factors are one,
carbon, slash your humic layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, clean and consistent watering
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, ionic sulfated minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And five, CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you've heard me say this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most unique thing about the canning
industry is the testing of our terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is because more terps means
higher overall plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are talking about nutrient density,
not just the weight of the yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this presentation, we are gonna be
going from academics to application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowledge is not power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the application of knowledge that's
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: And through this presentation,
I'm going to be encouraging you to take
[SPEAKER_01]: more action.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brands below are supported by us
because they help fix the five most
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pit moss is a little fibrous paper,
and it's your carbon, it's your consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, it's your water conservation,
and it's the future home for your microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and minerals to complete their enzyme
production cycle, which is 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend to don't start over 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with 5% of pit moss in your total
media, and then slowly add in over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drops of Balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drops of Balance is 64 plus negative ionic
sulfated minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, it cleans over 400 separate man-made
chemicals out of your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terriganics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terriganics, specifically EM1.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 80 separate bacteria colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always recommend an endofungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of brands out there that have
endofungis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend either Recharge or Mycos from
Extreme Gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last but not least is
Organishield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organishield is a completely seed IPM
product that will take care of any of your
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to this though, when it breaks
down, it breaks down into water,
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, and sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being the fifth most limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you have seen this picture if you
have downloaded the presentation before.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this situation though, I actually added
a few more things to help give the visual
[SPEAKER_01]: representation between the relationship
between bacteria, minerals, and enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's explain this real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes are responsible for breaking apart
and re-welding DNA, RNA, amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: peptides, and protein bonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every enzyme needs enzyme cofactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria make enzyme cofactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All enzyme cofactors are dependent upon
the amount of trace minerals in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: These enzymes can perform their task
hundreds of times before degrading in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been well documented that there are
92, maybe more, naturally occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: elements on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherein 82 of which have been found in
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just, you gotta think about that for a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: If plants took up those 82 separate
minerals, then that means bacteria at some
[SPEAKER_01]: point made them water soluble so that the
plant could take them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant wouldn't take it up if there
wasn't a purpose for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide real quick also talks a
little bit around visual, around your DNA,
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA, proteins, amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're gonna explain real fast
what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your DNA is responsible for storing and
transferring genetic information.
[SPEAKER_01]: RNA directly codes the amino acids and
acts as a messenger between DNA and the
[SPEAKER_01]: ribosomes, which are large and complex
enzymes to make proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: All interactions need bacteria and
cofactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids plus enzymes bond together in
two or three to make peptides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peptides plus enzymes bond together to
become cofactors.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this happens in a 24 hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the most important thing to
understand about this is that the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: and the minerals need to stay in the same
spot with a consistent water source for
[SPEAKER_01]: that enzyme reaction to complete its job
in that 24 hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if one of these things goes out of
whack, that production cycle has to
[SPEAKER_01]: restart or is incomplete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's talk about the law of
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's give a quick definition of what this
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: A law stating that the abundance or
distribution of orgasm can be controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: by certain factors, where levels of these
exceed the maximum or minimum limit of
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance of that orgasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean exactly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, just like how we talked about
before, there are zones of intolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then there are the tolerance range,
and then there's the optimum range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so let's give some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So example is like pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a pH of 3 or a pH of 9,
there's probably in the zones of
[SPEAKER_01]: intolerance and your plants are going to
die fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have, let's say, a pH of 5.6
and 7.3, that's more the tolerance range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's still going to grow,
it's still going to do its job,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're probably not going to see the
full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are in that optimum range of
5.8 to let's say 6.6, where the majority
[SPEAKER_01]: of the minerals are available,
well, that's going to be your optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: range, and you're probably going to see a
better potential for that plant to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other examples are temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too hot or it's too cold,
you can imagine what starts to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your light intensity, your photons,
your DLI, your daily light integral is too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're giving too little of light,
what's going to happen to the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you give too much light,
what's going to happen to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant has different expressions
throughout this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the plant doesn't have a lot of
photosynthesis going, we're going to see
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's too much light, we're probably
going to see a tacoing, or the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to say, hey, listen, it's a little
too much light for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one I want to bring up is the
magnetic charge, or the parts per million,
[SPEAKER_01]: or the EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these are really important to
understand around minerals, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what pretty much the rest of the
presentation is going to be about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one that I'd like to throw in
there relates to the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually relative humidity would be
VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people chase after VPD if you
don't know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out the VPD charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different charts for seedling
stage, vegetative stage, flowering stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's basically at a certain
temperature, what is the ideal humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: that you should be at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the chart, there's a dark green
range, there's a lighter green range,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's a yellow or red range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a good example I'd
figure I'd throw out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the reason why I love that is
because you're brain headed to exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was hoping it would go,
right into VPD as being the next example
[SPEAKER_01]: of how these all play out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the presentation's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's give an example around the law
of tolerance around magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to play into right exactly
what Chris is talking about, temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is your dominant macro negative
aion magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is your dominant macronutrient
positive cation magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you balance your phosphorus,
all the other negative aions can be
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means all the other trace minerals
that have a negative charge can be
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced as phosphorus is balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: If calcium is balanced, that means all the
other minerals that have a positive charge
[SPEAKER_01]: that are smaller than calcium can be
balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when one of those is off, remember
we're talking about the law of tolerance,
[SPEAKER_01]: too much phosphorus, too much calcium,
all the rest starts to get thrown off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's go into how does the magnet
play into the relationship around
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as calcium gets warmer, it gets
heavier, and its positive charge starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: get neutralized because of additional
negative electrons it collects.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the leaf temperature is above 86
degrees Fahrenheit, plants will go from
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis to a respiratory state.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, calcium stops being taken
up by the xylem and the calcium already
[SPEAKER_01]: taken up starts to settle into the oldest
growth of the plant until calcium can gain
[SPEAKER_01]: back its full positive cation charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, it gets lighter, calcium will
get lighter in density as it cools by the
[SPEAKER_01]: losing of the electrons and new calcium is
able to flow all the way back up the
[SPEAKER_01]: xylem, attracting the negative ions back
up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, you may also see leaves
deform in new growth because your VPD is
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where I'm starting to now
relate to the language of where all of us
[SPEAKER_01]: are talking about, but I'm also connecting
it with the science right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may also see purple leaves,
purple pedials, and the fading from the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom up due to a lack of flow of calcium
and boron and its relationship to the
[SPEAKER_01]: speed of ATP production and the robbing of
phosphorus because it is a mobile
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that all mean, example,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it gets too warm, the calcium
stops flowing up the xylem and it settles
[SPEAKER_01]: back down the plant, but the plant is
still doing ATP production, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP is adenosine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does it get new phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: It robs it from the bottom of the plant
and takes it up so that if it gets too
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, you may start to see phosphorus
deficiencies for this reason, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to catalyze itself to continue to
keep doing its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and phosphorus flow together like
a positive and negative magnet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium and phosphorus flow together until
phosphorus and other micronutrients are
[SPEAKER_01]: released and taken up in the sap of the
plant called the phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the xylem is the transportation of
water and minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phloem is the sap where the chemical
reactions, the enzymes, do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in between it, and we've done a number
of videos showing on that when you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: xylem and the phloem, the bacteria are
traveling in between them constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is because they're the
intermediate between the xylem and the
[SPEAKER_01]: phloem.
[SPEAKER_01]: All magnets, minerals, need to be present
in a 24 hour period to complete their
[SPEAKER_01]: enzyme reaction and cellular construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature to optimize enzymatic activity
is between 76 and 83 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of you guys have seen this slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing to pull from here is the
question you need to ask yourself when you
[SPEAKER_01]: see a deficiency in the toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the deficiency or toxicity appearing in
the older or newer growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Immobile nutrients shows their
deficiencies or excess in the newer
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mobile deficiencies show up as a
deficiency or excess in the older leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Semi-mobile can show up in the older or
newer leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just understand that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand the question as where am
I seeing it, you are able to eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: literally half your problems almost
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so now let's get into the first
mineral or really the continuation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals from part one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is once again is because
when you understand what I explained up
[SPEAKER_01]: top, it's gonna make the language and
everything I read here, it's gonna be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to flow in like you're just reading the
best book you ever read or watch the best
[SPEAKER_01]: movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so zinc aids in enzyme production
that are responsible for driving many
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolic reactions in all crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growth and development would stop if
specific enzymes were not present in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbohydrates, proteins, and chlorophyll
formation is reduced in enzyme deficient
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The significance of zinc stems from its
property as a divalent positive cation
[SPEAKER_01]: magnet, which means that zinc ions can
form two chemical bonds with an at ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: At ions are molecules that have a negative
magnetic charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: More trace minerals being present helps
the release of other minerals at a ion
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange site.
[SPEAKER_01]: When zinc is present, it helps release and
hold two other negative minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have to think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a big mineral, it doesn't do
a really good job at holding on to the
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller to tiny minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You actually need, as you go farther and
farther down, the smaller the mineral,
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to go actually be able to hold on
to those smaller magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it's important to understand
that the bigger ones can't really hold on
[SPEAKER_01]: to the smaller ones very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also call these things key leading
agents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another word that works in this
expression of trying to understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zinc helps soil structure because it
increases the magnetic charge in the
[SPEAKER_01]: attracting and the releasing of other
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: When smaller magnets are present,
it creates a stronger magnet that is
[SPEAKER_01]: called our humic layer and is why we have
to return what we take.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your humic layer is just a composition of
all these magnets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We always try to say it's 20% silt and
it's 10% carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clay and it's all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All those things creates a magnetic
charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have biology, we talk about
your EC increasing because your biology
[SPEAKER_01]: and your magnetic charge and your magnet
gets stronger and stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zinc is an immobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look to the newer leaves first to
identify a deficiency in toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wondering, zinc is found in
drops of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're over there on dropsofbalance
.com, make sure to type in Mr. Grow It for
[SPEAKER_01]: additional discounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all of the products that we're
talking about today are available on
[SPEAKER_01]: dropsofbalance.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on Perfect Gardens as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zinc, I tried to find a picture that
really represents a zinc deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: because these deficiencies and toxicities
are going to appear in your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically during certain times because
of the enzymatic production that these
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals specifically do during vegetative
state or flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried to find a picture that you'll
actually most likely see versus providing
[SPEAKER_01]: too many pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that really is going to pop
out and you see it, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, okay, that's a zinc deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're often going to see the stem tips
fail to elongate and grow shoot tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become bunched up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just goes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really the only mineral
deficiency that does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefits of malignanum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Important in microbial nitrogen
assimilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the nitrogen fixation cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So due to the presence of nitrogenase,
the enzyme that performs the N2 fixation
[SPEAKER_01]: to the NH3 ammonia and the nitrate
reductus, the enzyme that performs the
[SPEAKER_01]: first step in the nitrate NO3 negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it turns the nitrate NO3 negative to a
nitrite NO2 negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of understand this,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just malignanum itself, it helps use
the gas that's abundant in our air to make
[SPEAKER_01]: it more available for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I find that to be incredibly,
incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were talked about,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These two enzymes, these two bacterias
create these enzymes that allow malignanum
[SPEAKER_01]: to be utilized to its full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember, we were talking about what's
that most limiting factor is enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also important to potassium
absorption because the same bacteria that
[SPEAKER_01]: does the nitrogen fixation also breaks
down the potassium mineral and makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: water soluble through the cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really understanding the point here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a couple bacteria,
these few bacterias can solubilize,
[SPEAKER_01]: make these minerals water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have one bacteria, it's capable
of producing five, 10, hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes, hundreds of endimes, if you just
have the right mineral in that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go into the next few slides,
I'll explain more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You normally will see a zinc deficiency
with Mo because of the role they both play
[SPEAKER_01]: in photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should you care about Mo?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Australia went from a wheat importer
to a wheat exporter in winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year just by adding malignanum,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're wondering, malignanum,
yes, is in drops balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta understand this, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Malignanum is used in very, very,
very tiny amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use too much, your plants won't do
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will become very toxic for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just by adding this very small amount,
an entire country that had to import wheat
[SPEAKER_01]: the very next year went to being able to
sell wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're wondering whether this trace
mineral can increase your return on
[SPEAKER_01]: investment, yes, it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can boost your return on investment
because it can help boost your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malignanum is a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look to the older leaves first for your
deficiencies and toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so remember, malignanum, it's a mobile
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the picture, once again, I tried to
find is, it represents, the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you see a malignanum deficiency,
it'll look like the plant is aging.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is, when you see
the plant, you're gonna see, like our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you'll see the pistils coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna think that the plant's
maturing, like it's getting ready to be
[SPEAKER_01]: harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll even start to see the atherocyanin,
it's the purple, starting to appear in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you're not gonna see is,
you'll see a huge reduction in essential
[SPEAKER_01]: oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I mean, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's maturing, or the plant's
aging, but it's not maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I mean by the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very distinguishable.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see the malignanum deficiency,
you'll know exactly what I mean when you
[SPEAKER_01]: see this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And YouTube isn't gonna allow me to post
this picture, so this is gonna be one that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna wanna download the
presentation for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just click on the link to access the
presentation for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see, it's a very interesting
picture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the rarer ones is this type of
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you see it, you might have come
across it in the past, but it's very rare,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there's a good chance that you didn't
come across this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Chris is 100% right.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our group, we have clients now
worldwide, all in our membership group,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we must have seen a malignanum
deficiency maybe twice out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, four or 500 grows throughout
the whole year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about that, that was like,
they probably grew two or three times in
[SPEAKER_01]: the same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of 1200 separate grows,
we must have seen a malignanum deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: two times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just, you're not going to,
you might not see it, but just understand
[SPEAKER_01]: that that trace mineral, if it's applied
appropriately with the right bacterias,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can increase your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's gonna happen with a lot
of the rest of these minerals that we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about on this presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to appear in your plant
whether it makes it green or makes it tall
[SPEAKER_01]: or produces the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They appear in the plants differently
through the taste, the overall quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see them, they represent themselves in
a different level, in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just in the yield, they represent
themselves in another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So benefits of manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium aids in more than 300 enzymes
that regulates the human body and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we remember what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a bacteria and you have
manganese, it can produce 300 enzymes for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just these two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those enzymes go on to do their
function hundreds of times before the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant degrades it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be incredibly fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without manganese, chlorophyll cannot
capture sun energy for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered this in presentation one,
but I wanted to bring it back up because
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most limiting factor in most gardens
is enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is this so significant for me,
and I always love to re-say this,
[SPEAKER_01]: is capturing light.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Light is harmonic frequencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium is the receiver, so plants
are listening to music all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is proof, in my opinion, that plants
do like music.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants interpret the music they are
listening to by the trace minerals and the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes that are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have bacteria and manganese,
they are capable of creating, once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: over 300 enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese is an immobile nutrient,
so look to the newer leaves first to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify deficiencies and toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trace amounts, that's all we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, trace amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So manganese, we've seen this deficiency
probably no more than 10 times this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is not something you're
going to see a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are going to see this,
and they might think it's a calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And calcium and manganese are actually
both immobile nutrients, so they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be being used as the plant's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will actually appear at the same
time if it's deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big difference, though,
is calcium deficiencies, you could see
[SPEAKER_01]: holes in your leaves, or you could see a,
like, crosis in the leaves, like spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this one, you're going to see more,
like, brown spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you download the presentation,
you're going to be able to see exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm describing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see it, you'll be able to
distinguish it 100% from calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually come across this a handful
of times, and I can't even count the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of times somebody has commented on
my forum, for example, posted a picture
[SPEAKER_00]: like this and thought it was calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just upped the CalMag,
and they're doing more harm than good,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, because they're not actually fixing
the problem there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this gets mixed up with calcium
deficiency so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you already said that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the yellowing that kind of goes along
in with, like, the spotting, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a major indicator that it's
actually manganese and not calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually a great observation,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not until someone points it out that
you begin to notice it yourself,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've fixated on that brown for so long
that I think if I would have presented it
[SPEAKER_01]: the way you just described exactly,
the yellowing that falls along with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: manganese, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a random yellowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not your typical yellowing that you'd
see off of magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's like the interveinal corrosus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like just scattered and random on the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go back to the slide right
before it, what does manganese do,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're describing what the mineral is doing
if it's deficient within the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're seeing it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's beautiful, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for pointing that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so benefits of boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, I love boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is the throttle to sugar
transportation and is responsible for
[SPEAKER_01]: moving the energy into growing parts of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plays the key role in integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron also plays a key role in cell wall
formation and the functional integrity of
[SPEAKER_01]: biological membranes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically helps move the energy in the
last three weeks of the plant's life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it moves that sugar into the fruiting
and pollination and seed setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, again, if you want really strong,
long-lasting, flavorful food, nutritional
[SPEAKER_01]: dense food, where the flavor actually
lingers in your mouth and your mouth kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of waters, that's because there's boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's shifting the sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It plays a role in membrane metabolism and
function, thereby being involved in enzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction, as well as the transportation
for ions, metabolites, and hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boron is required in very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is an immobile nutrient, so look to the
new release to identify deficiencies and
[SPEAKER_01]: toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this picture I presented,
and Chris, just this, obviously this
[SPEAKER_01]: picture isn't going to be available as
well because we're showing a cannon
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure to download the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just to kind of highlight what we were
talking about a little bit before,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you see this picture, you're seeing
the rust and the brown happening in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at the flower,
the flower is like almost near maturity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could tell, like you'll see the
deficiency happen almost when it's at the
[SPEAKER_01]: near end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's because boron is responsible
for transferring those sugars,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in those last three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to see the expression of a
deficiency more often than a toxicity with
[SPEAKER_01]: boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to show up when the
majority of the enzymatic production is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening for that plant for boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually never come across this
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so rare and great picture,
by the way, really good picture there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it like once personally in my
whole life, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see it very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because these other minerals,
a lot of these minerals, like we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about before, there is the
essential minerals and beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these beneficial minerals and I'll
explain a little bit more on the next
[SPEAKER_01]: slide as well, but beneficial minerals,
they can be replaced by other minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't think they're absolutely
essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have like enough of the right
chemistry, these minerals can be
[SPEAKER_01]: interchangeable with other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why they don't really appear
as they don't really appear much just
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's enough chemistry to do the
function.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not the same thing, but it does
what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so cobalt cobalt is a beneficial
nutrient for single cell organisms,
[SPEAKER_01]: human beings and other mammals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it has not been considered as the
essential micronutrient for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make any sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, this element, along with other
elements like aluminum, selenium,
[SPEAKER_01]: silicon, titanium, has been considered as
a beneficial element for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A beneficial element can improve plant
health and status at low concentrations
[SPEAKER_01]: for the element to be considered an
essential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be required by plants to complete
its life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Must not be replaceable by other elements
and must directly participate in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at that definition,
that does make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about it like that,
it's like, do I need this to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and stem and the seed or the fruit
I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Although, when you explain what they do,
you begin to wonder why isn't it
[SPEAKER_01]: considered a beneficial mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cobalt inhibits the formation of
ethylene and delays senescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Senescence, it basically slows aging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cobalt is an anti-aging mineral,
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aging and maturing are different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still mature without aging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aging is being brittle, slow,
and weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maturing is reaching your highest
potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us have seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have this amazing grow,
at the very end, even when the
[SPEAKER_01]: atherocytosin is happening, the purple in
the leaves are happening, the plant still
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like it can keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because it's matured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't really aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cobalt and rhizosphere bacteria are
responsible in growing root tips and
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesizing cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay a lot of money for insect frass,
mushroom compost, and kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of cytokinins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cytokinins are plant hormones that
regulate plant growth and so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rhizobia and other nitrogen fixation
bacteria require cobalt for fixing
[SPEAKER_01]: atmospheric denitrification into ammonia,
providing plants with essential
[SPEAKER_01]: macronutrient nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but this is starting to sound like a
[SPEAKER_01]: conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now listen to what I just said a second
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cobalt is required.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of the required elements to turn
the gas in the atmosphere into usable
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't say it's an essential
mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the chemists know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really think about that,
if you could add a trace mineral in so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you wouldn't have to use something
you have to purchase to keep more money in
[SPEAKER_01]: your pocket, but they call this a
beneficial mineral versus an essential
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral, this is where I begin to think
about things differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cobalt plays a vital role in the
integration with iron, nickel,
[SPEAKER_01]: and zinc in maintaining cellular
homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to other micronutrients,
plants respond to cobalt concentrations in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil at low concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: It promotes plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it causes photos toxicity at higher
concentrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about nickel, another
beneficial nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickel is used 10 times less than
malignum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickel is a component for some plant
enzymes, most notably ureus, which
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolizes urea nitrogen into usable
ammonia within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without nickel, toxic levels of urea can
accumulate within the tissue, forming
[SPEAKER_01]: necrotic lesions in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, think about that for a second,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell farmers urea perfectly knowing
that the plant can't take it up,
[SPEAKER_01]: can't utilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant says, okay guys,
if you just give me a tiny bit of nickel
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little bit of biology, I can turn
your trash that you're giving me into
[SPEAKER_01]: something usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be incredibly interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realize that at that point, bacteria is
capable of evolving in its current
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though urea is a synthetic
fertilizer, it's still capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: processing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recent studies have shown that nickel
degrades a potent cytotoxin compound
[SPEAKER_01]: naturally produced by cellular metabolism,
which is produced during stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You give it a urea, what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the nickel helps dethrone and detox
that as the plant's going through rapid
[SPEAKER_01]: cellular metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are using urea, I would highly
recommend to use some type of foliar spray
[SPEAKER_01]: or implement it in nickel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're wondering if nickel's a drop
of balance, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Examining this role of nickel in the
relationship to stress suggests that
[SPEAKER_01]: nickel may have a key participation in
plant antioxidant metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nickel basically helps detox a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the picture I found here really just
shows it very well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are giving too much nitrogen,
what happens with the leaves?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dark green.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all these free radicals flowing in
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nickel helps detox that into a
healthier green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickel is important for seed germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Chris, you do your own genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickel would be so important for you if
you do seed germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickel is also important for bacteria and
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nickel behaves largely like zinc in the
soil plant system, but it forms strong
[SPEAKER_01]: chelates with soil organic matter,
thereby showing closeness to copper,
[SPEAKER_01]: all because it has a divalent and a
trivalent property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember what we were talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: A divalent can hold onto two other smaller
minerals, or two other minerals that have
[SPEAKER_01]: the opposite charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nickel doesn't just have a divalent
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a trivalent property,
so it can hold onto three other minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's used 10 times less than
malignant, yet it can hold onto three
[SPEAKER_01]: other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be, once again,
absolutely fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excess nickel also affects nutrient
absorption by roots, impairs plant
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism, inhibits photosynthesis and
transportation, and may also show signs of
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrosis and or necrosis, but that's not
always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowers are often deformed under these
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for nickel deficiency, seeds that
don't have nickel normally won't pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just inviable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they do pop, the more than likely
you're not going to be able to bring in a
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is just by a nickel
deficiency that's not a beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: element.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not an essential element.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beneficial element.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I think it was 20 years ago or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was enacted as an essential element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the newest one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's 17 essential elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nickel is the most recent one,
which around 20 years ago I believe it was
[SPEAKER_00]: added as an essential element.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for correcting me on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it when people point things out and
I love learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silicon, it's a beneficial element,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not essential?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got me going.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just beneficial, non-essential.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I say silicone, I mean silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like 20 years of construction
behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I say it's silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or silicone, I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so silicon is a beneficial
non-mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microorganisms like birch holia or botilus
and other bacterias solidifies different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of silicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon benefits plants when under stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It improves drought tolerance and delays
wilting in crops, enhances the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: resist micronutrients and other metal
toxicities like aluminum, copper,
[SPEAKER_01]: iron, manganese and zinc and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of point this out,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a mineral within all the other
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because how do you regulate the trace
minerals that they're so small,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, silicon, if it's in an environment,
will hold on to the excess trace minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: so they don't become toxic to your
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, find that to be absolutely
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How perfect the world we live in if we
don't mess with it too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon enhances growth and yield of all
annual vegetable crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Promotes upright growth, stronger and
thicker stems and shorter internodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Provides resistance to bacterial and
fungal diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Decreases some antibiotic stresses as
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica, which is different than silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica is processed silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is often alkaline by nature because of
what it does to make it soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, naturally, it's gonna increase
the pH and so what you're gonna wanna do
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're using a liquid silica,
you're gonna wanna add that first,
[SPEAKER_01]: pH your water and then add in your trace
minerals like drops of balance and then
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wondering if silicon is in drops
of balance, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in an acidic form, not an
alkaline form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon promotes light exposure of leaves
and makes an enormous difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichomes are mostly silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichomes play a role as a light wave
guide for the far infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silicon particles helps far infrared light
efficiently propagate inside the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: and leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: These properties are useful for
efficiently warming the plant since
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption of far infrared lights is
converted to heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is due to the photonic band edge at
which the velocity of light slows.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, silicon gives structure to
light as it enters and enhances the
[SPEAKER_01]: reflection and absorption of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, plants form trichomes in order
to efficiently capture far infrared light,
[SPEAKER_01]: which would be useful for the enhancement
of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't explain that well enough,
just to kind of recap on this,
[SPEAKER_01]: light is fast and it's coming through your
plant really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have silicon, it will actually
slow the light down, capture it better,
[SPEAKER_01]: and efficiently guide it to where it needs
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what silicon does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I don't understand how you
could ever be efficient with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights that you're using and repaying that
recurring bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wouldn't it be cooler if you
captured more of that light in your plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I think, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do that with silicon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think silicon is one of the most
undervalued nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you covered so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main ones is trichome
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at, I believe it's an electron
microscope, and you look at a trichome on
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant that wasn't fed silica versus what
was fed silica, you see a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in just the structure of the
trichome alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are going to supplement silica,
a couple things to know, you want
[SPEAKER_00]: salicylic acid or orthosalicylic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the bioavailable forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silicon dioxide is not a bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just forget to add those few things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that you brought that up,
Chris, because if you want long-term bag
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal with a great nose, you're going to
use silicon, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what we talked about, those trichomes
are made mostly of silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they had more of that structure when
they're finished off, do you think they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to retain those terpenes and those
oils a little better versus breaking off
[SPEAKER_01]: or floating away?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like, we all know this,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you look at your buddy's herb
and you're like, how old is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, last year was a crop,
and you're like, damn, it looks amazing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because they're using the right
essential minerals so that the plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: do with the bacteria so that they can
produce the enzymes needed to do its full
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like what I was saying, right,
they call these essential minerals versus
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial, but we're not, because we eat
our food quickly and because things get
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown away quickly in a lot of herbs,
a lot of people don't see the preservation
[SPEAKER_01]: of herbs long-term, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were taking care of a crop from
one year versus the, let's say you have
[SPEAKER_01]: two different crops and you use one with
bacteria and it has the right enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the other one that doesn't,
the one that, where you see the difference
[SPEAKER_01]: is a year later, where you're still able
to sell your crop versus the other one
[SPEAKER_01]: that's already started to degrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't acknowledge it, because it's
not now, but if we are capable of seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: it long-term, we do see the benefit,
and these are because of different enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: being produced at different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selenium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selenium is considered a beneficial
element for higher plants, enhancing
[SPEAKER_01]: antioxidant metabolism, photosynthesis,
secondary metabolites, and carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_01]: in plant leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: At low concentration, selenium enhances
photosynthesis in plants due to increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: protection of light-harvesting proteins
and photosensitive pigments called
[SPEAKER_01]: antennae complex, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about enzymes and
proteins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria and selenium are closely
interlinked as the element serves both
[SPEAKER_01]: essential nutrient requirements and energy
generation functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, selenium at high levels can be
toxic for bacterial homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Selenium and nickel help detox plant
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we were talking about
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free radicals, dark green, it's gonna
bring it back to being a healthy green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titanium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titanium is a semi-mobile beneficial
element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titanium applied via roots or leaves at
low concentrations have been documented to
[SPEAKER_01]: improve crop performance through
stimulating the activity of certain
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes, enhancing chlorophyll content and
photosynthesis, promoting nutrient uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthening stress tolerance,
and improving crop yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is considered a bio stimulant for
improving crop production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titanium's role in plants lies in its
interaction with other trace nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: elements, primarily iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron and titanium have a synergistic and
antagonistic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants experience iron deficiencies,
titanium helps induce the expression of
[SPEAKER_01]: genes related to iron, thereby enhancing
iron's uptake and utilization in improving
[SPEAKER_01]: plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me explain this a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we have a tank of gas and it
holds 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use up nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one left.
[SPEAKER_01]: And imagine you were capable of pushing a
button to make your engine more sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: so that one gallon actually acted like 10
gallons of gasoline.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what titanium does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes everything more hypersensitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a deficiency or there's not
enough in that environment, it will make
[SPEAKER_01]: it enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be, once again,
for soil that's incredibly depleted,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find titanium should be an essential
mineral versus a beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Titanium, if you're wondering,
is also in drops balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big question, how do I start applying
this knowledge today?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to go from academics to
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just shared all this knowledge,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to remember that knowledge is not
power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the application of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go back to the five most lending
factors that support enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, your carbon and your humic layer in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your carbon and your humic layer is
pit moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was telling you, it's these fibrous
little paper that acts as a net that keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: things in places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're using cocoa or sphagnum
peat moss, all these things, the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they're processed, kind of hold
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you put in your nutrients,
a lot of these nutrients, whereas if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using dry minerals, will actually
fall to the bottom because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: being captured very well in the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, pit moss is your carbon and
it's your future home for your microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: and minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because the microbes and the minerals
need a full 24 hours for those minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: and those bacterias staying undisturbed in
that environment for 24 hours to create
[SPEAKER_01]: those enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, you need clean and consistent
watering practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clean is what drops balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drops balance cleans over 400 separate
man-made chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your consistent watering practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because of the pit moss,
remember, no more than 5% in your media to
[SPEAKER_01]: start, it's paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it acts as a wicking system throughout
your entire media, helping to rebuild your
[SPEAKER_01]: humic layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you get your compost going and
re-amending your soil, it just helps start
[SPEAKER_01]: that process and keeps things together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three, ionic sulfated trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That drops the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 plus ionic sulfated trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, your biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pteranganics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 80 separate bacteria colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indo-fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend and support recharge or
extreme gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last but not least is your CO2,
which is Organishield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if you have a bug problem,
you need something that's gonna kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organishield does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it breaks down, into having no
residual, it breaks down to water,
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, and sugar, which is your fifth most
limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's wrap this up and understand
why is this significant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you actually need for
photosynthesis to do its job?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need CO2, water, magnesium,
iron, manganese, nitrogen, zinc,
[SPEAKER_01]: titanium, silicon, nickel, cobalt,
malignanum, sulfur, and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that, your photosynthesis is
gonna do its job and it's gonna do it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the best of its ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're missing one of these things,
I promise you, you're not gonna see the
[SPEAKER_01]: full potential of the plants and how you
measure that is in the terpium profiles at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go to the next one that you should
really pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one was capturing the light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The next one is your IPM, your Integrated
Pest Management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because bugs can really do damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wouldn't it be nice if you had the
ability to add in the right things,
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs wouldn't be attracted to your plants
because the leading reason why they think
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs are actually attracted to plants is
because of excess enzymes on those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's because bugs actually don't
have the ability to produce enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have their own digestive
enzymes, so they actually have to go rob
[SPEAKER_01]: them from another place to do their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature is trying to create a situation to
clean up its own mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how do you fix this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you fix this by giving the plant
what it needs so it can complete its 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hour cycle of the enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you actually need so your
plants are less attractive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you need magnesium, you need sulfur,
you need malignanum, you need boron,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need sugar, selenium, and nickel,
and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: All staying in the same spot for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you did that, there's a very good
chance you're probably never going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a bug breakout.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably still have some bugs,
but for the most part, they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be attracted to your crop, they'll be
attracted to your buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scientists are trying to replace bacteria
and say they are creating the same amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm confused.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these essential elements,
some non-essential elements, but are
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely did a great job with this
presentation and I'm super thankful that
[SPEAKER_00]: you came on here and spilled this
knowledge for us for a second time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, where can people find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me over at Perfect Gardens
TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I work with Perfect Gardens and
also I highly ask to subscribe to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect Gardens YouTube channel,
it always helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys ever want a part three,
just let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this subject about gardening and I
could definitely make a part three about
[SPEAKER_01]: something new and interesting if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just leave a comment down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think between part one and part
two, we covered all of the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: elements except for chlorine, carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might have to drag you back for a
part three so we could finish up the
[SPEAKER_00]: essential elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot more non-essential
elements that we could potentially cover
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want a part three, comment down
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Write part three and maybe we can get Mark
back for a part three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, thank you so much for coming out to
the podcast once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one that I'm going to look back at
and continue to learn more and more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more every time I watch it because it's a
lot of information, really tough to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: it all in one run, basically impossible to
absorb it all in one run unless you're one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those people who have a sponge for a
brain and can't absorb it all in one run.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is something that is definitely
going to be on the rerun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an incredibly confusing and
complex topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I really tried to break it
down to say, hey, listen, guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: the most limiting law of minimum,
your most limiting factor in your garden
[SPEAKER_01]: for especially a biologically alive garden
is enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead of trying to get complex in
the knowledge, I tried to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, listen, these are the products out
there that are going to solve 80% of your
[SPEAKER_01]: problems immediately and help you get to
this goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, thank you so much for
allowing me to come to this channel and
[SPEAKER_01]: share a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit that thumbs up if you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already.
