[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and soak it in dechlorinated
water that's been pHed at 5.5 to 5.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to aim rate at 5.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the sweet spot for cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm in a seedling stage looking for
the 200 ppm, I might make the compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: For indoor grows, I don't suggest anything
bigger than a 7 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get some monstrous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally try to tell people 1 gallons,
3 gallons, and 5 gallons are like really
[SPEAKER_01]: the best size pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get disheartened and you're
not gonna want to grow and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna want to cultivate because you're
gonna feel like you wasted a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less, less, less, less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them really become accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's a night and day difference
when you feed compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within two days your plants will look
completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my favorite thing about
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 71.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Derek,
also known as Chronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 13 years and
grows a variety of plants such as
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, lettuce, herbs, medicinal
varieties, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: He makes his own super soil and that's
what he's gonna talk about in today's
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also touches upon compost teas,
pH, ppm, container size, and water
[SPEAKER_00]: sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Spider Farmer for being a

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Derek from
Homegrown World.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited about today's topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk all about super soils
and how to create them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people listening in on
this, and a lot of people with garden in
[SPEAKER_00]: general, wants to make things more
efficient, wants to be more hands off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to mix up a soil and then use
that one batch throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just basically watering in the
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a lot of people's goals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But today we're going to talk all about
that and how you do that and so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an educator for medicinal plant
medicine, as well as various mycology
[SPEAKER_01]: forums that I help write guides for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just in general, I educate for various
plant and cultivation purposes for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it on YouTube, Instagram,
and as well as my own podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been a wonderful experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown up growing my own plants from
lettuce, tomatoes to medicinal mushrooms
[SPEAKER_01]: like shiitake or culinary mushrooms like
pink oysters to just so many more plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm a huge animal and herb lover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely got to get my own,
you know, mints and peppermints out of my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: For use in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely been a passion of mine
for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's your style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors, outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What medium are you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you grow synthetic inputs and so on
and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've touched on a little bit of all of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mainly do organic cultivation with soils
now, but I've done pretty much every type
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivation, but I prefer organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the first question here,
which is what is a super soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So super soil is essentially, well,
that phrase was coined by actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: for many people who don't know,
there was a grower named Subcool that
[SPEAKER_01]: crafted a very legendary, it's called a
legacy mix actually now because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: created a legacy for himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: He unfortunately has passed away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, the Dane company has kept
this recipe, which is basically a specific
[SPEAKER_01]: blended soil that has the proper aeration,
nutrient mixture, acidity level,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're seeking as a individual
cultivator to be able to grow your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: from start to finish, whether it be tomato
plants, lettuce, anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to add nutrients or if you
have to add anything, bare minimum of
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a topping of earthworm casting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's meant to pretty much be completely
sufficient with microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, they include microbial life,
whether it's some different mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterias and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the good stuff that you want in your
garden, but it's a mixture that's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: good nutrient blend for your plant start
to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard about the Subcool's super
soil mix and there's a few other popular
[SPEAKER_00]: ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you used any of those mixes or do you
have kind of your own?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually do my own blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used Coots before once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've used it once back on a farm
years ago in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't guarantee that, but I have used it
since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like their blend quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build the soil, Subcool's soil recipes and
a few others are ones that I really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I just build my own and they're
very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just with what I have at my local
gardening centers that just make it
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you make this super soil,
talking about medicinal plants in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a balance of nutrition that has to
happen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally speaking, a lot of people
notice that in the vegetation stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant typically updates more nitrogen
and the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got their uptaking more of the
phosphorus and potassium, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're making this super soil,
is there a specific balance that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to achieve that will last you
throughout the entire grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how does that work since the plant has
different nutritional needs throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a wonderful question and that's
something that pretty much every super
[SPEAKER_01]: soil creator really has to struggle with,
you know, dialing in their recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go for the one, three, two, ratio just
right off the gate for NPK, which is one
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio of nitrogen to three ratios of
potassium and two ratios of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got that backwards, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to go for that mixture and I try
to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I'm going to play around and do
like maybe two, four, eight, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, I'm going to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to see how that runs with the
tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like how I'm going to see it,
it runs with a medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the types of things you have
to look for when I tell people to make
[SPEAKER_01]: their own recipes at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm looking for my ratio,
just simple one, three, two is the
[SPEAKER_01]: simplistic way to make sure that you're
not going to burn your plants and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have quality enough food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, also what comes into play is EC and
PPM when you're talking about that as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a little more variables into
it, but one, three, two is about the ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: that I like to keep within.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get deeper into the fertilizer and
the amendments that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit here, I know there's a
lot of new folks that are just mixing up
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the easier ways for the
purposes of podcast of organization and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to simplify the information that
you're about to say is, is breaking it
[SPEAKER_00]: down into your base, whether it be like a
Pete or a cocoa or something else aeration
[SPEAKER_00]: after that, and then kind of talking about
like compost and worm castings and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the additional fertilizers and amendments
that you put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of really makes up an entire
super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the Pete and cocoa are
using either one of those or is there
[SPEAKER_00]: something else that you're using as a base
to begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's actually cocoa is the big one
that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get cocoa blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like, there's a few companies I get
them from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll just actually snag the
cocoa that's made for reptiles cause it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a little more cleaner sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's actually a little cheaper too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but if they don't have that,
my reptile store in the blocks,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause they're, they're out or something,
I'll go with like a Rio cocoa or a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, a, uh, uh, just to your in general,
uh, pro mix cocoa, just go ahead and break
[SPEAKER_01]: it down or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but just a coconut husk or coconut
fibers really does good aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do prefer, sometimes I do prefer
Pete Moss in my mixes, depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and add to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's going to be a more earthworm
heavy mix, I'm going to go ahead and add a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more Pete Moss to my mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I find that it, it holds a little more
moisture for the longterm versus a cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coco can really let it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, earthworm castings really like to,
uh, not dry out as far as a microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: life, you know, going after them and
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more, uh, better when it's
humid and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So promotes better bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the basis I like to
stick to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really stray away from too many of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to stick to my cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately not all cocoa is
created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can get them in several different
ways, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The brick, for example, is very common to
where it's dried up in a brick and you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to actually hydrate it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, uh, you know, some people do the
rinsing and buffering or you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: bag stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do to like prepare the cocoa
to begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a, that's a wonderful question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of people skip this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when they tell me it's like pre
ready or, you know, it's been pHed or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, I still do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do this with all my cocoa just to make
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, first thing is, is I go ahead and
soak it in dechlorinated water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been pHed at a 5.5 to 5.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to aim rate at 5.7.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the sweet spot for cocoa
when you're prepping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to add a kelp extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use germ genie from the company I
work with, but you can really use,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you have a little bit of kelp
meal or any sort of kelp extract,
[SPEAKER_01]: extract, you can put it in there like a T
and basically just allow that to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: soak up the nutrients from the kelp and
use a bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about maybe a hundred PPM,
200 PPM max.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really want much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just want to soak it and allow some
nutrients to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're going to leave that in there
for 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally after 48 hours, I go ahead
and wring it as long as I'm getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's squeezable out to where it's
just a few drops wringing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the proper moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want puddles and puddles of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking just maybe, you know,
just a little puddle in your palm,
[SPEAKER_01]: four or five drops out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You squeeze it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you make sure you drain the excess
water thoroughly and you basically allow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually do as a base, um, about five
cups if I'm mixing, uh, let's say a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon, uh, bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do like five to six cups of cocoa at
the base and then I'll start adding
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments and I'll usually do a cup of
cocoa every so, so often just to really
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that it's layered through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for aeration, let's talk about
that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using any type of aeration at all,
such as perlite, pumice, uh, or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumice is something I really like to get
my hands on when, um, the local garden
[SPEAKER_01]: center here has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they don't have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll usually use perlite cause it's a
little cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's the amount you put in
there with that five cups of cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm doing five cups of cocoa,
I usually try to do one to two cups of
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite, and then I'll stack about a cup
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So roughly about three cups to three and a
half cups total.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five cups of cocoa, three cups of
perlite, nice aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll do about two and a half cups of
earthworm castings to three cups of
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworm castings throughout,
make a really heavy mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically, since I don't have a
composter where I live, I'm in an
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want a composter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be all stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I go ahead and add roots organic 707
blend, which is kind of like a nice,
[SPEAKER_01]: even blend that I like to add,
has a little bit of everything in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: has some, uh, uh, mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just for myself, I'll go ahead
and hit it with a shot of great white
[SPEAKER_01]: myco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like the blends I like
to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now what I'm making more for is,
uh, for strains that, um, I don't plant my
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings directly in this mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally I use a happy frog,
just a very, very bare, bare minimum,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or a Rockwell cube or, or just a cocoa
pod or something like that, or a peat moss
[SPEAKER_01]: pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get them started, uh,
whatever it is, tomato plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: lettuce plants, um, or lettuce,
you know, broccoli, cabbage, anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets started elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's been adjusted and it can really
start up taking nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to stick them into my mixes because
they're a little more hotter or just a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more, more nutrient heavy for the
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned use worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use any type of compost at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually people either use the worm
castings or the compost, or some people
[SPEAKER_00]: will use both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have access to compost
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much all I do is just a
organic, um, uh, earthworm castings I get
[SPEAKER_01]: from my local garden center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have a composter here in my garage,
but it doesn't get hot enough for it to
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, if I was using compost,
I would back down on probably how much
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworm castings I'm using.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably increase, uh, just a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of adding more perlite,
I'd probably add some play sand to my
[SPEAKER_01]: mixture and just kind of give it a little
bit of a, a sand through the mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of, I've noticed that that's getting
very popular and I like seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that, that's also where I might think
about swapping the perlite for pumice.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm doing a more compost heavy mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so those are, those are things you
would want to think, think about if you do
[SPEAKER_01]: have compost to access what you're using
for the specific, uh, aeration tools,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, play sand is a very great
granular, uh, tool to aerate some,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, more heavier or denser types of
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how about fertilizer to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you kind of touched upon this,
but are you adding like a blend of a
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer or are you doing individual
amendments into the soil mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really just depends on how,
what kind of gardening I want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I want a headache free hassle,
free gardening, and I want to do mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: just having to water, just pH my water,
dechlorinate it, um, not worry about too
[SPEAKER_01]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and make compost
teas once bi-weekly and I'm going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: them, um, relatively.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm in a seedling stage looking for
the 200 PPM, I might make the compost tea
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I do that is because there's going to
be about 150 to 200 active PPMs of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of activated, uh, nutrients accessible
after brewing the tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's still going to be some of
the leftover nutrients that haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: completely digested by the microbial life
that we added to that tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're still going to have like a
leaching factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll feed my plants with a little bit
of higher PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then through the week, while I water
them, I kind of rid out that excess 100
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM that they're digesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you, you see that
your plants might show some greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: burn, which is for those who don't know
greenhouse burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically when people take,
uh, plants at your local garden centers
[SPEAKER_01]: and feed them immensely so that they can
ship them out to Walmart or various places
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're full of nutrients,
but they're just burned on the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not overly burned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like where I get my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, it's just smooth
sailing for two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the compost tea,
you know, two, three weeks, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: every two or three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just smooth sailing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I'm adding amendments, it's going
to be a regiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be where, um,
I'm going to go based off my PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm starting at seedling stage,
I'm going to look for maybe just simple
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp extracts or simple types of,
uh, feeds that are a hundred PPM to 200
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just feed it with every feeding or
feed it with every, every other watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that'll be that, um, all my early
feeds get pH to 5.7 to 5.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's generally the range I like to
go with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.9 is kind of my target range for the
vegetative, um, you know, what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: uptaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, it's those, uh,
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really like the calcium, calcium,
the magnesium, the boron, the manganese,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just really depends on what your
nutrient line is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's why if you're doing a super
soil mix, it's really good to kind of mix
[SPEAKER_01]: it a little bit heavier that a,
not a seedling, but a juvenile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a two week old plant,
three week old plant can go ahead and
[SPEAKER_01]: prosper in, because then you find yourself
not having to buy nutrients, not having to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy a nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just go to your local garden
center and grab some earthworm castings
[SPEAKER_01]: and throw, you know, a cup on top,
mix it in, and then just water if you need
[SPEAKER_01]: more, um, food for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to be just simple compost teas
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not adding in any like bone
meal, rock phosphate, any epsom salts,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just doing the, the cocoa with the
perlite, with the worm castings,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 707, little bit of 707 soil you
mentioned, and then just doing teas
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they get, the teas get all the bone
meal, the blood meal and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go ahead and enrich the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause I, I like to make sure it's not
too hot from, hot from the get go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I found when I was adding my bone
meals, my blood meals, my ratios were
[SPEAKER_01]: always changing because I was finding
that, okay, this one type of plant likes
[SPEAKER_01]: this mix, but the next type doesn't early
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did find better was just to make
a very, not, um, neutral super soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but kind of a neutral super soil mix that
was happy with all my plants that I could,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, if this strains of, of lettuce,
like, um, you know, the purple head
[SPEAKER_01]: cabbage or, or this strain of,
you know, lemongrass or compared to my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my, um, my peppermints or my spearmints,
if they're eating heavy, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can feed them more, you know,
but if the, the back, the back basils not
[SPEAKER_01]: eating heavy or the back, um, tomatoes
aren't even eating heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can back off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to feed them this compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of where I found my even
mix is just adding the things to adding my
[SPEAKER_01]: excess nutrients or excess additives to
the compost tea, let them brew,
[SPEAKER_01]: let them really become accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll see, I mean, it's a night
and day difference when you feed compost
[SPEAKER_01]: teas within two days, your plants will
look completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my favorite thing about,
um, organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know some people have a recipe for
the vegetation stage and some people have
[SPEAKER_00]: a recipe for the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do that as well, or are you just
one recipe or one tea type of tea
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the whole grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I definitely change it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, uh, I'm a believer of changing up
your PPM range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a believer of changing up your pH
ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, shifting pH ranges are
what's healthy for plants because that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so for my vegetative compost tea,
it's going to be around the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're talking about a, a nice veggie
plant, five weeks old, four weeks old,
[SPEAKER_01]: something nice and hearty, it's going to
be around the 500 to 650 PPM range,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 700 max.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's going to give them a nice
boost whether what that's going to be is
[SPEAKER_01]: what that's going to look like is usually,
uh, it's going to be one cup of bat guano,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, one and a half cups of earthworm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I go ahead and add one cup of
blood meal and then half a cup of,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, a quarter cup of bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that bone meal is in there just to
introduce some of that PK, the earthworm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, the bat guano, all of it has NPK
throughout of it really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's just the bat guano and the,
uh, the, uh, earthworm casting is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be much higher in nitrogen and the calcium
and magnesium and boron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to let that steep for 24
to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally hit it with some great white
Myco or if I, um, my local garden center
[SPEAKER_01]: has a brand called Mike's M Y K E S it's a
really great brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys have it in your garden
centers, it is actually a very nice brand
[SPEAKER_01]: of mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you always let it blend for about
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, generally that's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My flower feed is going to be,
uh, one cup of bat guano, uh, one cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworm castings, two cups of bone meal,
and then I'm going to do a quarter cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically going to be a PK heavy,
uh, compost tea versus the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen heavy, um, vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ratios, is that for your
standard five gallon bucket with about
[SPEAKER_00]: four gallons of water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, roughly I feel that thing to about 4.5
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel it to the brim and then are you
diluting that tea down with water or are
[SPEAKER_00]: you just giving it directly to the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll actually take that tea and I have
a one gallon of jug that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have, we go through milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every so often I'll clean my milk jugs
and I'll have a free jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'll use a one gallon jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fill it up about halfway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll take another free jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have for my normal water, get
dechlorinated water, pH it proper,
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and pour it in kind of dilute it
half and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 50% of a mix that way it goes
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I make more, most of my compost tea
and I'm able to off five gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to feed for, you know,
almost a month and, and I can keep that
[SPEAKER_01]: key, that tea brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have a lid for ours that keeps it
sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I go and check the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I check the, uh, the healthy, uh,
bacteria on top and make sure nothing's
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in and make sure it's all clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to keep tea prolonged times,
you don't want to keep it prolonged.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have good aeration and proper
temperature, because you can grow bad
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, generally that our teas go with
how many plants, um, we usually run and
[SPEAKER_01]: just vegetables and herbs and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our teas are gone in like a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but we'll feed, you know, I have 30
plus plants going plus maybe 20
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll feed all that in a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every week will be a new tea for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, sometimes it'll be every second
week because if it is a heavier tea,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll last a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: On your initial mix that you mix up,
are you aiming for a specific EC to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: or PPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: EC is a little tough for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's still things I'm getting
used to, uh, as far as like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never, I've had organic farmers
telling me about the electrical,
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical conductivity with organic
farming and saying like, yo, if you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: reading currents, if your plants aren't
putting out electrical currents,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not doing it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's, that's been the goal of
mine to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more so getting there by measuring my
PPM and making sure my PPMs are more
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate and on par.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the big thing that I wasn't doing
when I was first making my teas is I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just go ahead and dumping like two cups of
this, three cups of that, four cups,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like just so much crap and just
doing overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I checked my PPMs and they'd be
like, my runoff of my plant would be like
[SPEAKER_01]: 4,000 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be wondering why they were out of
range and all messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I started recently going,
okay, you know what I'm going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make my teas a lot less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I check my PPM, my team,
okay, my PPM might be a thousand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let me go check it diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now diluted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at five 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH pH is 6.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked my runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My runoffs are now, you know, if it's I'm
feeding 600 and I have a super soil mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we talked about generally the runoff
would be about seven 50, 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's generally where I want to be
for a veging plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really healthy amount of food for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right as they get into flowering,
you're going to want to switch them over
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to want that a thousand
range, 1100 range, 1200 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had plants that love 1500 range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it just completely depends
on what you have, what's fruiting on your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes sometimes can take a lot of
nutrients, but yeah, I find measuring my
[SPEAKER_01]: PPMs have dialed me in much more than,
than when I used to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you touched a little bit about
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your base soil is cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of people don't aim for a
different pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cocoa, then they would in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for when it
comes to pH and your super soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my pH and my super soil, I try to keep
that at 6.0, 6.1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good just running throughout
the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something you have to remember if you're
going to use cocoa in any mix whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to use plain cocoa,
growing cocoa, whatever you're doing in
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa, cocoa holds PK and will leach it
later on in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always have to remember,
okay, my cocoa is holding this PK.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that my cocoa is holding onto a
pH range of around 6.3 to 6.7,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's roughly where those
nutrients lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why our plants absorb them best
at the 6.0 to 6.5 range is because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that flowering fruiting stage for the
acidic and alkaline nutrients that flow in
[SPEAKER_01]: that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I generally think like, okay,
at 6.0 when I, when flower hits,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start raging it to 6.1,
but I'm going to back off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start watering those first
few weeks because I know my cocoa has
[SPEAKER_01]: leached PK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally the first two weeks of every
time I switched to flower, I noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting happening on my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead and just feed a very,
very minimal water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually won't compost feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just be like water and molasses or
water and kelp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll notice that my PPMs when I'm off
the runoff will continue to rise,
[SPEAKER_01]: will keep rising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll just drop after about a
week or so, because that leaching has
[SPEAKER_01]: finally come out because there it's
something with, I don't know the science,
[SPEAKER_01]: the true science behind cocoa,
but I do know it's something with those
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of cocoa, the fibrous breaks down
of the plant, something to do with coconut
[SPEAKER_01]: husk and finally releasing the potassium
and phosphorus after so many weeks or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's based on how much you feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally the rule of thumb is your
cocoa generally can hold it on for six to
[SPEAKER_01]: eight weeks after you fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's rule of thumb for most,
most cocoa growers that have taught me
[SPEAKER_01]: anything about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have your initial supervision.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a clear plan of the teas you're
going to be doing in the vegetation stage
[SPEAKER_00]: and the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have people that are growing
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What container size would you recommend
for those folks?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also have folks that are
growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a specific container size that
you have that you recommend for those
[SPEAKER_00]: folks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoors, you can get away with pretty
much plastic pot, fabric pots,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, wood pots, PVC pots,
whatever you want to get grow in and get
[SPEAKER_01]: makeshift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for indoor growers, you always have to
take your grow tent or space or height
[SPEAKER_01]: into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing people always think,
you know, oh, I have a two or six foot 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have six foot of grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you really don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to take in your height of your
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to take in the distance from
the ceiling to your light and then the
[SPEAKER_01]: distance from the light to your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So light to your canopy has to always be
at minimum 12 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally you want it at about 14 so you
don't burn your plants or bleach your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and you get a really nice par
displacement and you can maximize your
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 inches is like when you're really
dialed in and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always have to calculate that
distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever that distance in between,
so let's say you have five feet of grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space or four feet of grow space in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you know that at two feet,
you need to flip your plants to flower or
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting so that those plants double and
potentially don't outgrow your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, I even like to do it a little
shorter than two feet because some plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will go 300% stretch on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that height, you got to take into
consideration what size grow tent or what
[SPEAKER_01]: size pot you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: For indoor grows, I don't suggest anything
bigger than a seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get some monstrous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I generally try to tell people one
gallons, three gallons, and five gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: are like really the best size pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a smaller size tents,
your one gallons and three gallons can
[SPEAKER_01]: really do great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your one gallons can be perfect for
vegetating and then you can transplant to
[SPEAKER_01]: your three gallons for your flowering or
fruiting stages and they can work wonders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your five gallons, you're going to get
into the much, much, much larger plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you're talking about four by four
grow spaces, five by five grow spaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a four by eight grow space,
something that's larger, even a three by
[SPEAKER_01]: three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just really don't want to surpass your
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not going to throw a five
gallon into two by two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just know your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't suggest anything past the five
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want ease indoors,
I always suggest more of a wider pot than
[SPEAKER_01]: a taller pot so that you have more grow
room and more height to train your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for outdoors, it really makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want black plants or black pots
for your plants outdoors because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: heat and you can burn your roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you generally want tan white or some
sort of reflective barrier for your pots
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a lot of aeration, but you want a
lot of moisture control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what a lot of growers do that I see is
build grow boxes where there are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have individual pots inside these grow
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be like rings of sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be like a pot of sand and then
the plant inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like a big grow box and the roots
can go out from underneath and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: grow within the grow box.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a ring of sand around it that
the growers can go, okay, it's a high pot
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go pour cold water onto the
sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure the roots are cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always have to think about outdoors
for temperature and for size outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go 50 gallon grow pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get 150 gallon grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do a whole, you know,
plant it in the ground and then it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: a thousand gallon grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really just depends on what your
space is for your general average
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not trying to grow 20 foot trees
or 10 foot monsters, you would probably
[SPEAKER_01]: want something around the 35 to 45 or 50
gallon marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smart pots are really, really handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, tan makes a great color for
reflecting sun while also keeping in heat
[SPEAKER_01]: for the nighttime temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's some things to consider when
you're choosing your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe you touched upon this in the
beginning of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you don't actually
start out in this super soil mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said you like to use Fox Farm
Happy Frog, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: To start your seedlings in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that like just in a small solo cup
and you're planting it in Happy Frog,
[SPEAKER_00]: letting his plants grow to a certain point
and then transplanting into your final
[SPEAKER_00]: container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you going from like a solo cup to a
one gallon then up to like a five gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: So generally I'll go solo cup,
one gallon, five gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's like an auto flower that I
just want to go ahead and get them in
[SPEAKER_01]: their pot, get them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's like a tomato plant,
where it's something where you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a smaller, viney, more grown,
straightforward and get those little
[SPEAKER_01]: cherry tomatoes going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a strawberry plant and you want
your mini strawberries to grow more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: bush in a box or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what I'm kind of doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want something that's more quicker,
more off going, I want to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the medicinal qualities now or
whatever, I'll keep them in small pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll be my one gallons and three
gallons and I'll just keep them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them get root bound and then I'll
go ahead and turn them over to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cycle or whatever requires of
them to go ahead and fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way their roots stay locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hormones, so for those listening
wondering how plants even flower fruit or
[SPEAKER_01]: produce fruiting bodies, it's ethylene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a female flowering hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whenever the plants are root locked
in most species of plants, a self
[SPEAKER_01]: preservation kind of signal goes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're genetically a little easier to
produce ethylene with.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why hermaphrodition kind of
happens in various species of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why plants will seed out
themselves sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for most medicinal plants, if I want a
very fast response, whether it's a photo
[SPEAKER_01]: period cycle or not, I'll go ahead and
keep them in a one gallon, root lock them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I really, maybe I want some a
little bigger size to them, those first
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks of flower, I'll put them into a
three gallon and then they'll get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll get a little bulkier, but they'll
stay relatively smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can keep them in a little two by two
herb garden that I have going with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little Mars Hydro or something,
something small, nothing crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I want monsters, if I want some
really nice trees, really nice quality
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, really nice herbs, whatever I'm
doing, it's gonna go from the one gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: to a three gallon, proper feeding,
proper compost teas, training the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: nine yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's gonna go straight to a five
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: One week before I go ahead and flip under
flowers so the roots can actually adjust,
[SPEAKER_01]: handle the shock and then properly stretch
out root bound and really get a nice root
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I usually dust those roots with
mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go the full nine yards and really try to
make sure that when they're going into
[SPEAKER_01]: those bigger homes, I'm doing them justice
because just because you put a plant in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger pot doesn't mean it's gonna get
bigger successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of microbiology,
root science that has to go into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're eating and if they're taking
in all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it just depends on what I'm
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally I like to stick at that
three gallon to five gallon marker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three gallons are my quick medicine
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and I probably should ask this
early, but are you letting that soil cook
[SPEAKER_00]: for a period of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people let it sit for a while,
let the microbes get to work, start
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking down some of those organic
amendments and then they'll plant into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that be a week later, two weeks
later, a month later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard upwards of two months later,
people after they mix, two months later,
[SPEAKER_00]: them actually planting into that super
soil mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your mix that you mentioned in this
podcast episode, are you letting it cook
[SPEAKER_00]: at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how long?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not two months, I'm not that
patient crazy about it, but yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do let it sit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll usually feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can picture a little four by
four tent for those listening and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: just a few rows of grow pots filled with
soil, imagine the back row, four pots
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with plants, the rest of them
completely empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll water all of them with compost,
give them all food and I'll let those
[SPEAKER_01]: soils cook just under the light and the
humidity and the temperatures and I'll let
[SPEAKER_01]: them cook for about one to two weeks and
then I get to planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I know the microbial life is
active.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some activated nutrients ready for
the plants and it's healthy and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to dig into water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water can certainly be a variable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start with Auro water,
which has little to no PPM, distilled
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got rainwater, tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my tap water comes in at 485 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, what are you using for a water
source?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have a recommended,
like a different soil mix recommended for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's using hard water with high
PPM versus somebody using Auro water?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest questions I
think I get all the time is about water
[SPEAKER_01]: because water can seriously mess up a
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily I'm in a place in Colorado where
we have well water that comes out roughly
[SPEAKER_01]: less than 50 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little high in pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to dechlorinate it, you know,
just make sure I pH right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in Florida, I never used tap
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very harsh unless I had a water
softener or some sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: rain softener system or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never using tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my best recommendations for those
people who are using any sort of or living
[SPEAKER_01]: in areas where it's harsh water and you
don't want to spend money on an Auro
[SPEAKER_01]: system because Auro is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reverse osmosis is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if I could have an Auro system to
pump all my water, I totally would,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always affordable for most
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest if you have to have to
use tap water, get aquatic dechlorinators
[SPEAKER_01]: to at least take the harsh chemicals and
chlorine out of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally just a little couple of
drops in your water and it goes a long
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of it, you're going to want to
use a mixture that is generally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking maybe 150 PPM hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're looking at like getting a very
heavy base of happy frog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix with like if not three quarters of
cocoa and just doing that as a mix with a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of earthworm castings because
your minerals and all your stuff from your
[SPEAKER_01]: water is going to add salts and various
things that your plants are actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed or try to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not going to use distilled
water, if you're not going to use anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to rid those salts or clean those salts or
minerals or nutrients or whatever's inside
[SPEAKER_01]: your water, because sometimes it's
limestone in people's water and it's super
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy limestone, you can't limestone build
up in your soil and that's an extremely,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it can become limestone toxic
for your plants depending on what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with water problems, if you have a
severe enough problem and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate your own garden, medicine,
whatever you're trying to do to be
[SPEAKER_01]: self-sufficient, I always tell people it
is an investment to try to get a rain
[SPEAKER_01]: softener system, a water softener system,
an RO system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really at the end of the day,
the amount of headaches and jumps and
[SPEAKER_01]: hoops you're going to have to go through
to try to just get a successful harvest or
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or fruit or flower or whatever
you're trying to get with tap water,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a very hard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your pH is usually all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with salts and minerals and
water is the leaching effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cocoa leaches and holds nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you put salts and things and
you have salt build up, eventually that
[SPEAKER_01]: salt does break down and that salt will
leach and cause toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll shoot your plants out of range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll cause your PPMs to go from you're
sitting at 500 next thing you know you're
[SPEAKER_01]: at 2000 because all these salts just
leached into the soil and they became bio
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now your plants are eating them and
now your plants are absorbing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now your plants are also dropping them
all up back into the soil because it can't
[SPEAKER_01]: take anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now your plants are just stuck in this
cocoon drowning of nutrients because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what's happening with the salts
underneath the soil essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's much more into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a scientist or a biologist,
but yeah, I think spending the money in an
[SPEAKER_01]: RO system or bottle gallons of distilled
water, man, it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use tap water if it's too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my best suggestion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is everything for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collecting rainwater and filtering it with
a YouTube how to filter little gravel salt
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I wouldn't suggest tap water if
it's a hard water like Florida,
[SPEAKER_01]: Georgia, Alabama, or even Pennsylvania,
New York, those I wouldn't suggest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to use my tap water for grow and
it did not turn out good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I mentioned, 485 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the EPA approval is like no higher
than 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like dancing the line on not being
approved by the EPA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was at Flint's level right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did not come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invested in RO system and I haven't
looked back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there's a lot of people out
there that say RO systems are a waste
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're wasting water for every
gallon of RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two or three times that amount is
coming out of the drain line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can actually take that water
from the drain line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can not hook it up to your drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually put it into a bucket and
use it for your outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, that's what a lot of people
commonly do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take that water and they use it for
something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing just to keep in mind
for anyone who is considering using RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water, but maybe not going to go towards
it because of the fact they don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: waste the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for someone like me, I had to go to RO
just because my water that's accessible to
[SPEAKER_00]: me is just not usable really for the
plants that I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kills them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't do anything good for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I love your suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to RO guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a step back and thinking about
everything that has to do with mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: soils, you know, creating a super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for someone who's
new to mixing soils?
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just less is so much more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really going down to your local
growth center, this is all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've talked to a bunch of different
cultivators, Kyle Cushman, Eric Branstad,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Dank Duchess, Spoking with Pod,
all sorts of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mr. Grow is now getting to talk to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely been really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think every one of you guys will
always agree that less is more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just go ahead and do bare
minimum grab if you're not sure if you
[SPEAKER_01]: want peat moss or cocoa, okay,
go grab a nice blend of soil, go grab a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of peat moss, toss it in,
go grab a little bone meal, blood meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: toss a little in and leave it that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking do like half recipe of
everything I decided to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test the waters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do do less is more because when you
go extravagant and go buying everything
[SPEAKER_01]: and go spend your money on all this and
then your plants fail, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: disheartened and you're not going to want
to grow and you're not going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate because you're going to feel
like you wasted a whole bunch of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less, less, less, less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you have upcoming in the
future?
