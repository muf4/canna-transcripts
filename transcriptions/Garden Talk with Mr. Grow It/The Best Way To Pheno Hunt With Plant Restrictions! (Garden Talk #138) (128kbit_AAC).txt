[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 138.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview CE420.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a fellow YouTuber with nearly 3,000
subscribers, and he's big into phenol
[SPEAKER_00]: hunting plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a plant count restriction,
and phenol hunting in that case can be a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about it in this episode and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These podcast episodes are broken down
into short clips and put on a dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: channel called Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link both of those channels down in
the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their humidifiers, which can
help increase the humidity in your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their humidifiers have 10 different levels
and spark control features, such as VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: and humidity programming, so you can get
precise humidity control.

[SPEAKER_00]: Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stash Blend is a 2-1-5 plant additive that
can be used with synthetic bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or in living soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply mix half a teaspoon of Stash Blend
into a gallon of water, then water your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingredients include corn steep liquor,
seaweed extract, humic acid, beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria, silica, and mycorrhizal fungi.

UV, IR, and Deep Red supplemental lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: These supplemental lights can easily be
added to the Mars Hydro FC and FCE series
[SPEAKER_00]: of LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's commonly said that UV light will
increase the production of secondary
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolites, and that it also enhances
plant's resistance to pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: IR light is said to stimulate stem growth
and flowering, as well as induce plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: enter their sleep stage quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discount code MRGROWIT works on their
website, mars-hydro.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll place the link in the description of
this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got into growing pretty early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was super interested in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to watch my dad grow, and I got to
get my claws in an early understanding of
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant and its medicinal benefits that
are still being researched on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even wrote a research paper in
middle school, one of the few A's I got in
[SPEAKER_01]: school, thank you very much, of why it
should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a persuasive essay that I feel
like I did really well on, and the teacher
[SPEAKER_01]: must have concurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all that snowballed through my
teenage years through an interest and a
[SPEAKER_01]: passion and a fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of my stubborn personality and
just my grasp on this plant, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: look like I'm going to let it go anytime
soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just expanding into an ever
wondrous kind of passion and interest and
[SPEAKER_01]: drive to do better, not only in this
aspect, but also branching into gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: other things and in different ways,
being able to feed my family and the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just been a beautiful journey all
along, and I'm trying to spread the
[SPEAKER_01]: message as much as I can that anyone can
do these things, no matter what you have
[SPEAKER_01]: going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is going to be something
very important to tackle when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with something that's super
limited and you can't grow as much as you
[SPEAKER_01]: might want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to find what you might need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know now you're at the point where
you will actually been doing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: several years, which is YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you have some other social media
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of got you into YouTube in this
community?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so I've been into YouTube for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been into content creation for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A YouTuber that I took very early
inspiration on actually is Joe Sanagato,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he is a YouTuber from New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: He made super entertaining content that I
found really appealing as a teenager.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got into the content creation route
very early on in my late teen years and
[SPEAKER_01]: made a bunch of videos on a channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have since deleted everything on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went from content creation and then
I got the passion for gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, if I just did content
creation, if I did documentation around
[SPEAKER_01]: this plan, I think I might have something
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sense like listen to a lot of guys
like Pigeons 420, a guy, Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: who you guys know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got into a lot of these guys and
even Mr. Canucks Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of them were a little bit deeper
into the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to back off a little bit,
learn the nomenclature, get the layman's
[SPEAKER_01]: terms down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was like, all right,
this seems like something that isn't the
[SPEAKER_01]: most complicated thing in the world,
because getting early on in the growing I
[SPEAKER_01]: thought it was going to be like this super
specific scientific process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, watching my dad do synthetic
nutrients, I was like, he's putting these
[SPEAKER_01]: potions together, mixing everything into
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: He knows everything to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was very early on in that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically since I popped my first
beans, it's been history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just been realizing it's a
process that I was going to be dialing in
[SPEAKER_01]: over decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not a easy thing to do by any
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got to say your channel is
probably one of the most underrated
[SPEAKER_00]: channels in this community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know how much of a struggle it can
be on YouTube in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much suppression going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely have links to his
channel down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually do a pinned comment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click on his channel, check out his
content and sub up to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've really appreciated the shout
out on the From the Satch podcast and that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been calling my channel underrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been very flattering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how hard it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the least I can do is kind of mention
some smaller channels and center of
[SPEAKER_00]: traffic your way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into your growth style first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll get into phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say your growth style
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoor grower, outdoors,
are you in soil, cocoa, hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic, organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've grown in many styles, but I'll
just go over my primary style.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's indoor synthetic growing in peat
moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the way I normally like to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I know the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what I've gotten great results
repeatedly over time with, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I'm really looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I plan on experimenting with every
single grow style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to get it under my belt,
seeing if I can do it, seeing if I like it
[SPEAKER_01]: more than what I'm doing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the girl I have right at this
moment, I have happy frog soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been completely depleted of its
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I then have reused from the outdoor
season, put into indoor pots, and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: currently in five gallon pots flowering
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have them in week six.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the stash blend
technically makes my grow synganic,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know the from the stash blend
can be used with living soil and organic
[SPEAKER_01]: mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I'm using base flower
nutrients from Remo nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am using the stash blend for all the
additives and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, stash blend, whether or not it's
organic is a common question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided not to go the OMRI
certified route.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just and a lot of companies these
days aren't going that route because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to register in each state and all
that goes above my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from what I was told by higher ups and
people know what's going on, they said
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just simply not worth it to go for
that OMRI certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the formulation chemist says in his
eyes, it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just going to go by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really respect certifications
personally as much as I respect the
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can get down there and find the
scientist's word on it, I'll just take
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So phenol hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a lot of new growers that don't
even know what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is phenol hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for anyone who has no idea,
there's actually two steps you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be taking to actually get to get to phenol
hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're going to want to do is
you're going to want to find a genome that
[SPEAKER_01]: fits what you are looking for in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a genome is basically just the
specific cultivar you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get down to phenol
hunting, you're going to get a few seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to pop them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to find the
different expressions from that specific
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to be your phenol
hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're popping five seeds,
twelve seeds or a hundred seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which we'll get into later.
[SPEAKER_01]: It technically is phenol hunting if you
are actively and consciously looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: the different characteristics within a
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a very important distinction
when you're looking for terpene ratios,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid, looking for that ratio and
then looking for if you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: colors, sense, taste, growth structure to
fit your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all things that are going to fit
into the phenol hunting category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you phenol hunt male plants,
female plants or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: So up to this point, I have been only
phenol hunting female plants and looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for the best characteristics I can find
from the packs of seeds I buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, I'll buy packs of seeds from
three to ten seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I normally can get a pretty good
diversity of phenols within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But coming up in the future, I'm actually
going to be making my own strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is going to be exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also think I'm going to be
phenol hunting chill out OG, which comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to me from Mr. Groat again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for your generosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I don't know if this is going to
be a side note or edited out, but I did
[SPEAKER_01]: want to ask you if it's OK if I breed with
that seed, either to make more chill out
[SPEAKER_01]: OG as long as I don't take credit or try
to sell it or anything like that or make
[SPEAKER_01]: crosses of it potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like anything that's kind of
released to the public is open source,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, at that point, right,
where anybody can really do anything with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's kind of the way I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that people are kind of more
protective over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, go ahead and do what you want
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I wanted your perspective because
I've been doing a little bit of homework
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently some people are really
picking on what genetics or if you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also ask P about permission of reacting
to a video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has pretty much the same
perspective on that kind of stuff that you
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like it supports the community
a lot, especially if you're in a position
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can't spend 50 to 100 dollars on
seeds every single time you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a bit much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you mentioned what your
plant max count is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing recreationally in Michigan,
my plant count is 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have quite a bit of a blessing when
it comes to the flexibility of being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can get really complicated when you
get lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I were to go the caregiver route,
which I feel I think I would technically
[SPEAKER_01]: be qualified to go into that route,
I would be able to have I believe it's up
[SPEAKER_01]: to six or seven patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the total plant count I could get up
to is like 75, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can go pretty high because you can
get 12 plants per patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But simply working under the plant count
of 12, there are ways I can work around
[SPEAKER_01]: that and easily, easily get more than
enough herb to last me a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so yeah, so that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot better than many of the
states out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely consider yourself lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a blessing every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting back into pheno hunting,
you kind of touch upon characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many different
characteristics that you can look for when
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What characteristics do you look for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I look for a very pungent
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to look for the smells,
the flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also want to look for a medicinal
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I do have really high anxiety,
I've been teething off the depression a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my chronic pain is where I feel like I
get the most grief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those things are specifically what I'm
going to be targeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: To grow outdoors, I would have to pheno
hunt for something that could deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: high heat and humidity during the summer
months and then be able to chill out
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard during the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is becoming less and less true
within recent years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually been super warm for the
fall, but that's kind of getting off to a
[SPEAKER_01]: different direction a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically finding something to either
fit my grow style indoors if I have an
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that's already set up,
which I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just finding something that's going to
be able to help me, whether it's with my
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain or being able to sleep at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I look for basically something
that tastes good to me and is effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't look for anything super specific
when it comes to the grow structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: because personally I can grow around
anything and I can adjust what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well, I feel like, to fit the
plant's needs and then find out if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something I want later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are a long list of things that
you can look for when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a short list here that
I'll mention just for FYI, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: audience here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growth structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant height, weight, build, density and
root structure, hardiness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look to see the plant's reaction
to temperatures, dependence on water,
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to mold and pests, overall
strength, terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the aroma coming from each
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Appearance, the bud's color and structure,
trichomes, either lanky with small heads
[SPEAKER_00]: or short stock with fat heads,
and peak maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How early the plant is ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a list of characteristics
that you can potentially look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually one of my least favorite
questions, just because I find it so
[SPEAKER_01]: threatening that there are so many things
that you can go into that it's hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: give a comprehensive talk on the different
characteristics you can look for,
[SPEAKER_01]: but basically find something that's
tolerable for your grow style,
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow well with your other plants if
you have them going, or something you can
[SPEAKER_01]: work around or is predictable,
stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are really going to help you out here in
that aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally personal preference,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You as the grower are the one actually
determining what you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of people these days
really focus on bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see what the plant looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care about the flavor
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they be in the black or the gray
market, the free market, whatever you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, plants that I've grown have
really great terpene profiles and really
[SPEAKER_01]: great flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flavor and smell, but in my opinion,
also have really great bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what it is these people are
doing where they have a really beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and it's super trichomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a holographic image,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up using it and it's not
super great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hunch it's dry and storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's normally what it comes down
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aren't really going after
those lower temps when it comes to drying
[SPEAKER_00]: and storing, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of people are now going in
wine fridges or even their regular
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerator just above freezing
temperature in order to preserve it for
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other people, they're just letting it
go in their room temperature or even
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, terpenes are just
volatizing off at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a hunch a lot of this stuff
where people are like, oh, this doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any flavor on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, how was it stored?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you actually had it for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because all the flavor could be gone by
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't really help my
perspective that when I harvest a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll go through like a two week curing
stage by the end of all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll be gone within five months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it won't even get to the optimal curing
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could have some bias there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you see these things
with a dispose where they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it got chopped like a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, then why is it in a
package right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did it get through all this testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that's completely different,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just crazy processes that I don't
know the ins and outs of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're planting seeds,
how many do you plant for a phenol hunt?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm going to go for a phenol hunt
and I'm looking to specifically get a
[SPEAKER_01]: keeper from the hunt, I'm normally going
to go five to 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I do that is because I want
at least three to five different
[SPEAKER_01]: expressions that the plant is going to go
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've grown cultivars where I plant
three seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of them are drastically
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've grown cultivars throughout the
years where I popped like seven seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but all of them are very close to the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to want to when it comes
to your own number, you're going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at the stability of the genetics
and also the reputability of the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: and find out what you're really getting
and do as much homework as you possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, yeah, I'll go normally the five to 10
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that gives you a pretty good
web.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like when I go into breeding,
I'm definitely going to have to pop like
[SPEAKER_01]: seven at the minimum, because then there's
that 50-50 chance that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: male to female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to want to almost guarantee
that I'm going to have something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to breed with and if not cancel those
ones out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still have to look into how to
phenol hunt for an optimal male plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: how I'm going to integrate those and which
way I'm going to go with the crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to take a whole lot of
homework on its own, but that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be later down the road too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, popping a 10 pack I feel like is
pretty common for home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just start with the 10
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they get from the breeder and
then just plant them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, if you've got the
regular ones, I actually planted a 10 pack
[SPEAKER_00]: before and seven were male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, well, there goes that
phenol hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could breed around that and be
like, well, I'm going to breed these seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll just have infinite things I can
phenol hunt from these genetics and find
[SPEAKER_01]: out what it can really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then that plant limit comes back into
play and you're like, well, I can't plant
[SPEAKER_01]: all these 150 seeds I got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you play Elden Ring or
not, but I feel like popping a hundred to
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basically playing phenol hunting on
easy mode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can just pick out something
and then be like, yeah, this is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I was a phenol hunt with hundreds
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be incredible, but
unfortunately that's not legal for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've planted your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using for a medium typically
and then container size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'll go right from planting in a
solo cup, letting that plant sprout,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then once its roots get too big for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do that to avoid overwatering
primarily, but also not to waste too much
[SPEAKER_01]: space on a individual plant or too much
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll go from the solo cup right into a
one gallon fabric pot and I'll use fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: pots throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for the medium, it'll normalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll normally be peat moss unless I go
with an organic mix, but if I go with an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic mix, it normally was amended with
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So peat moss primarily, and that's just
how I've been doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it has good drainage,
good aeration, and it's just a solid grow
[SPEAKER_01]: medium overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I actually get into the
flower, I'll normally increase my pot
[SPEAKER_01]: size, whatever it is, by at least three to
five gallons because I want to give those
[SPEAKER_01]: roots time to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm really worried about their
growth rate, it will be more, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: phenospecific, that is cultivar specific,
and you just kind of got to know your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and how often you're transplanting
at that point, because once you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, you're going to have to stop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the larger container, the easier it
can be, generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I learned a little tip from a breeder
way back Well, actually not too far back,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Canadian Leaf Genetics, shout out to
him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the podcast before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had mentioned that he does it in two
gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two gallons, that's kind of small,
but he's keeping the plant small because
[SPEAKER_00]: he's really just pheno hunting and he's
not really growing these plants massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's basically putting them in two
gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I tried it, it actually worked
out pretty good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had them all hooked up to auto
watering systems because it becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult because the medium can dry out
so quickly in two gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding an auto watering system like
Blue Mats, for example, it makes things so
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a lot of success doing a two
gallon, you know, and then I can fit more
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in that grow space, whatever grow
space I'm using, whether it be a four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four, four by eight or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've done pheno hunts in three
gallons, five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, just makes it a little
bit easier when it comes to like watering
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I did a low key content creator
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was actually looking through all
these different channels and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: find smaller ones that maybe don't have
the appreciation or ones that are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this guy who only grew like
super small plants and he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember if he had them in like a
solo cup or like different small
[SPEAKER_01]: containers, but they were all basically
like directly in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, this is enough flower for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only need four plants that yield
like a half ounce to an ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's really cool for you,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another YouTuber that grows
exclusively in Pringle cans from what I
[SPEAKER_01]: can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you've seen that or
heard of him, but then there's also the
[SPEAKER_01]: solo cup challenge that's going on right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some crazy stuff you can do
with smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just not something I do a lot and I
wouldn't necessarily be comfortable unless
[SPEAKER_01]: I dialed in a auto watering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely do stuff with smaller
containers really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Mr. Boothman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he grows in one gal and I'm trying
to get him on the podcast here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he does some, he gets some amazing
results with those small containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's got these real tall plants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to get him on the podcast
eventually and talk about that because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do so much in small containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's generally frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, Oh, what is this guy doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was real small scale and stuff,
but it's like different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that gentleman said that you had went
to his channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's only growing for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he only needs a half ounce per
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let him do his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If he's able to do it and that works for
him now hats off to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's so many different styles
to grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many different size containers you can
use and ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's what makes it so fun in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more thing too that actually goes
along with that is that there's actual
[SPEAKER_01]: limits to how much you can have within
your household.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in some states they limit it at 10
ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, if I can only have
10 ounces, I can't grow a plant that's
[SPEAKER_01]: one, two, three pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm literally not allowed to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something else that people need
to take into consideration too,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when they're frowning upon
different growers, grow styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, not only are you wrong,
but you're, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically use for a
fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So going into nutrients, I've basically
grown from beginning to end with Remo
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done garden, like kitchen scraps,
organic material, just kind of amended
[SPEAKER_01]: into our peat moss mix into a giant pile
in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would serve for outdoor soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are the two routes that I've
gone down so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've only been doing this for four
years, working on my fifth year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't had a lot of time to
experiment or experiment well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to branching off
again, but it's been synthetic indoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: organic outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just kind of how it's been up
to this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for when it
comes to like temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you into that at all or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this time this, this grow cycle in my
six by two closet, I've actually been
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting with a exhale CO2 bag,
which I picked up and I actually noticed a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher growth rate since putting it in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been good, but I haven't
actually been able to measure the levels
[SPEAKER_01]: on that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for temperature, humidity, I'm going
lower on the temperature since we're
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the late flower, but it's still so
hot in that room right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to have to take a seal
off, keep it dark in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's getting like into the mid
seventies when I want it to be in the high
[SPEAKER_01]: to mid sixties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then humidity, I kind of go middle of
the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it at 75, 70 to 75 in the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't actually been able to
measure it because my, my, my meter broke
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually measures that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if the battery died or
something like that, but I haven't noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: anything unhealthy going on with the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kind of go middle of the road,
vanilla, see how the plants actually react
[SPEAKER_01]: to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's textbook for these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually dealing with a little bit
of toxicity when it comes to the nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to have to flush those plants
out a little bit and see how they recover
[SPEAKER_01]: from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This latent flower, it might be a little
complex, but environment, not
[SPEAKER_01]: experimenting too crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two spider farmer SF 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which that style, I don't know if they
make anymore, but that's a very solid
[SPEAKER_01]: light for a small bro space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got two of them dimmed all the
way to a hundred percent really cranking
[SPEAKER_01]: that light down on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they seem to be responding really
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going to be my next question is,
are there certain lighting levels that you
[SPEAKER_00]: aim for when phenol hunting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will kind of adjust the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll play with the light, whether they
give increased amount of par, the normal
[SPEAKER_00]: or less than normal, just to kind of see
how the plant reacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you messing with the light levels at
all, or just kind of keeping consistent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I've been keeping it pretty
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to just stay in the middle of
the road between stretching for light and
[SPEAKER_01]: then also burning from too much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have a par meter, but that's
something I do want to experiment with in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I have the budget to get something
like that, because it can be kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: pricey, especially when you go for the
higher end ones that are going to give you
[SPEAKER_01]: like the exact number really quickly and
just be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't been experimenting too much
with light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been doing anything super crazy
to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to find an expression that
these plants are going to give me in a
[SPEAKER_01]: decent environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, if I want to do a run
where I'm like, well, it could get maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more of this if I just change
this about my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those things I want to
experiment with in the future is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: integrating extra ultraviolet light to
give the plants the incentive to put on
[SPEAKER_01]: the extra protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the form of trichomes and see if I can
make a little bit more trichome density
[SPEAKER_01]: out of a genetic and get more terpenes and
more cannabinoids and more just more of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and then go through an air cure
and see what it comes out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now how about plant training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is one thing that when you're
phenol hunting, you got some people who
[SPEAKER_00]: just want to let the plant grow naturally
and see how the plant reacts naturally and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kind of make their selections from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people train the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see how the plant reacts when
you're training it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What way do you go about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have two answers for this
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will train a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm looking to get like a lot of clones
off of it and I want to maximize the tops,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking to get the best candidates I
can possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a normal like looking for a pheno
doing the pop-in, I just want this
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar, this pheno right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will go through the training because I
want to see how it's going to react to my
[SPEAKER_01]: growth style and put up with the stresses
that I want to put forth because if it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't put up with that and it's not
going to put out what I need it to when
[SPEAKER_01]: push comes to shove, I'm not going to
stress myself out with dealing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic that's not going to deal with me
because I feel like you need a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship in every single aspect of the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I'm going into breeding and
making my own genetic, I'm actually going
[SPEAKER_01]: to take the opposite step in seeing how
the plant interacts with the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it grows naturally to get a
general idea of what I could do with that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's going to give me a
deeper layer of understanding once I get
[SPEAKER_01]: to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as stress, there are so
many different ways you can stress the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Precision stress is kind of what I'm
referring to, whether it be the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, humidity, drought stress,
nutrient stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any type of stresses for the
plant while you're pheno hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really doing anything special.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did put a second light in there,
doubling up the light, giving it something
[SPEAKER_01]: that is not necessarily used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to precision stress,
I might experiment with drought stress or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I do a lot of low stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I like my plants to be
able to deal with at the very least,
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to get your stems weak and bent
over so we can maximize your tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: As for high stress training, I try to
avoid it as much as I possibly can,
[SPEAKER_01]: but stems break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes it does get integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's on accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't do anything super special when
it comes to the stresses of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: other than it's going to have light
stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have wind stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these things just help the plant
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're already things that you have
going on in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as anything super special,
no.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are those precision stresses I
feel like everyone kind of participates in
[SPEAKER_01]: that do help the plant, whether we notice
it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reminds me of the stem rub technique
where people basically take the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: rub it, and then smell their fingers and
try to get the hint of the aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: see whether they like it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to kind of continue with
that plant or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do the stem rub technique at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you typically go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When are you doing it and such?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do do the stem rub technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will normally be most effective
before the flower stage, after your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: have sexually matured.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're showing those preflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the hairs on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting ready to put out what
they're going to put out genetically with
[SPEAKER_01]: their finishing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you're going to get the best
picture from the stem rub, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't take that to heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is something you like, obviously
push it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're just getting a little bit of
hint of something, plus that
[SPEAKER_01]: stereotypical, you know, a veg plant
smell, that blanket smell, that you get
[SPEAKER_01]: from the plants, you walk in and you're
like, oh, well, someone's growing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's mostly what you're going
to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't take that to heart too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get a general idea of what you
might be dealing with, I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just keep in mind that the intensity
is going to change for every single
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's like, oh, it's nutty and
there's like a little bit of vanilla
[SPEAKER_01]: there, the vanilla might come out just in
the flowers way more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, your plant
plants produce trichomes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning all the way to the end of their
growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are terpenes and flavonoids in
those trichomes, no matter the density.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will get something and it will
represent your plant's genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't take that to heart because it
can change or it could be not as good as
[SPEAKER_01]: you think, or it could be way better than
you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just use it as a general guide as to
what you're going to be looking for when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree with you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the stem row technique for as
long as I've been growing actually for 14
[SPEAKER_00]: years, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've learned about it right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had plants where I did the stem row
technique, smell my fingers, got one set
[SPEAKER_00]: of aromas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flipped over a flower and then things have
changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wouldn't suggest wiping out plants
because of a stem rub and then seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: like, hey, I'm not really giving it what
I'm looking for off the stem rub while the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant's in veg, so I'm going to kill it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potentially, it might be better to let
that plant get into flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: really start to develop and then kind of
getting the smells directly from the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, if you really feel like you
need to know exactly what that plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be, I would say take clones in
super early veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just chop off a portion of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a couple of clones, put them through
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if you have the slots to do so,
and then you will actually get a real
[SPEAKER_01]: picture of what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then by that point, you'll be able to
just eliminate plants if you really want
[SPEAKER_01]: to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's one route to go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you have the slots for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're talking about plant limits,
so you can't ignore that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's another tool you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than the stem rub technique,
you can flower out a clone and that'll
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you exactly what's going on with that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of mentioned killing off plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know when do you start to kill
off plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you the type of person that kind of
kills off plants throughout the veg stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people will see a stunted
seedling and they'll get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people will let that plant continue
to grow and they'll let it grow all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way till the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about it when you start to
kill off plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so basically my process for killing
off plants is I will get all the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: the end to give you the end picture and
then we'll go into the little nitty
[SPEAKER_01]: gritty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get all the way to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take my first hit from cured herb,
I know exactly what plants I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from the veg stage, I take clones of
every single plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that I have enough room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take clones of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they're vegging well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from the point where I know
they're done, they will be about week four
[SPEAKER_01]: or five flower or a veg, excuse me,
and then I will be able to eliminate the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones I don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need to narrow down your plant
count to be able to fit your phenohunt,
[SPEAKER_01]: then just take the best and healthiest
plants, clone them, kill off the weak ones
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I would suggest, and then let them
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a very stubborn grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I see a plant struggling and it's
not doing as well as the others in the veg
[SPEAKER_01]: stage, I assume that if I take care of it,
give it a little bit of love and care
[SPEAKER_01]: through my experience, those plants are
normally the ones that have put out the
[SPEAKER_01]: best herb and whether that's from
evolution, saying that the weaker plants
[SPEAKER_01]: need to have the better characteristics
towards the end for whatever reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe to protect them from pests or
dealing with light stress to protect them
[SPEAKER_01]: from one variability that they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something that I have noticed but
yeah, a lot of people don't have time for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest just, if you need to
kill off the weak ones, I personally don't
[SPEAKER_01]: as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to refrain from doing that in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy that goes that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is from Massachusetts and I think his
plant count is six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's six per person and then 12
per household.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have more than one adult in
there, you can do 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think he's just running six and he's
got to kill off the weak and then clone
[SPEAKER_00]: the good ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he continues on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have another buddy who will max out his
plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he'll grow 12 and then he'll hunt
through that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what he'll do is he'll let all the
plants grow all the way until the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: then towards the very end of flowering and
he'll basically cut as many clones as he
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's right before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the clones haven't rooted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's still within that plant count if
things haven't rooted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's monster cropping it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's bringing it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's cloning the plant while it's in
flower right at harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's taken one of those lower branches and
he leaves the lower branches actually for
[SPEAKER_00]: this particular reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will cut those off right
before flipping a flower or the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cut off those lower branches,
not going to reach the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: He leaves it because he wants to monster
crop at the end of his cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was kind of an interesting
way to go about it when you have a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: count, when you have that restriction,
be able to grow plants all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: end and then just monster crop at the very
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest the plants and then you've got
your clones that you've monster cropped
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can continue on with those
genetics if you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can definitely see that argument,
especially when you are someone who does
[SPEAKER_01]: their due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of research in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eugenio hunted really well and you can
look at the fragrance that your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: putting off and say, oh, it has this,
this, that and the other terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to help me with these
problems or this is going to do that for
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is definitely something you can
narrow down for sure at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do like to see how the plants make
me feel before I make my final decision
[SPEAKER_01]: firsthand because I don't want to throw
away something like I have in the past
[SPEAKER_01]: that I didn't think I was going to like,
but was actually really good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just try to avoid that mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you kind of touched upon this next
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask it more direct,
which is at what point do you select the
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper pheno?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you select just one or do you have
multiple keepers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm talking about the very,
very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're ready to select and then get rid of
the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep this one and continue on with it
in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What point do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's a complicated question,
but the short answer is the very end of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to two weeks to a month in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see how it is treating me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see how some other people like that I
consume with and decide at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to selecting keepers,
I normally will end up with more than one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's normally not more than two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, if you're dealing with a
plant limit, you can't just have this
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivar be like your whole thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get a variation variety is
king when it comes to that and being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow a large amount of herb that varies
in different ways and excels in different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's going to help a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can fill up your slots with 12
different phenos that are fantastic in 12
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways or six or four,
that's going to be the best scenario for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then getting into the breeding again,
which I want to get into, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a matter of finding which characteristics
I want to see in my own genetic and then
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing those two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be a lot more of a
picky process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be taking a lot more
notes than just being like, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll deal with everything that comes
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there was a G13 that I grew and it
was just the most lanky thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was throwing random branches every
which way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was super stout and short,
but not because it lacked veg growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of where it was going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once you got into flower,
it grew such big, dense buds that were
[SPEAKER_01]: frosty, full of flavor, loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just a lot to bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see why someone would throw
that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, it was one of the top 10
plants I ever grew when it came to final
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's getting rid of something like
that is something I'm trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of reminds me of my Chillout OG,
which is naturally a slower grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, you know, I don't even know if I
want to say a slower grower, but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: shorter structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really, it's within his genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mother is a Pakistan Valley,
which is a hundred percent Indica shorter
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, real tight inter nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically it's the plant that is
smaller than all the rest, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the planted at the same time, I should
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when flipping the flower, you get that
stretch and you get from really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, dense frosty buds under the
right grow conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, which was just explaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, I could see people who,
there have been people have reached out to
[SPEAKER_00]: me like, what's wrong with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it growing so slow and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's in genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wait until flower and see how it
develops from there, because I think you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just a quick note.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two white widows in there and one I
had, and it's in the middle, which I tried
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep my shorter ones in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one was really short.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going into flower, it was about the
same size as my second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of weeks in this plant just shot
right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bent its arm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's its main branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just kept on going up and up and
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually had to come in at like,
I think it was week four and just tuck it
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the side and really try not to
break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one didn't even touch
the second net, didn't, did not touch the
[SPEAKER_01]: second trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to depend greatly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What your genetics are, how it's going to
interact in flower is way different than
[SPEAKER_01]: how it acts in veg a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a huge unpredictability
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you have stable genetics,
it might not be something you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: worry about if you can take the breeder's
word on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was really crazy to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great points.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to throw a hypothetical at
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had a plant count of four instead
of 12, I feel like a 12, we got a little,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a luxury having a plank
out of 12, but as you know, Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, four there, they're stuck
with a four as a plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you go about phenol hunting with
a plant count max of four?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, again, this is a nightmare of mine
and it keeps me up at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to theory craft around how I'm
going to work around that issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially with the laws changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's something everyone needs to
be worried about is if the wrong people
[SPEAKER_01]: get the wrong idea of what we're doing,
a lot more people could be facing this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem and we could be back to none.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as for tackling four, what I would do
personally, going through the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: stage, I would pick out what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is throwing out characteristics that
I want to keep out of these four plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I'm having an issue with one or two
of them, that is an absolute deal breaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm automatically going to get rid of
those two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to deal with those problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have four plants and then I'm down
to two again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can do from that point is
that you can either super crop and take a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of small clones and revege them,
throw out the clones that aren't doing as
[SPEAKER_01]: well and keep the two that have rooted and
are doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could cut them at the end of their
flower cycle and then go through the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: drying process and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the side, you actually kept some
bud sites on those plants to then go
[SPEAKER_01]: through a revege cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you could either revege those two
plants and grow them out as their own
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can take clones, finish off your
garden and basically start from the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of that grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep those two phenos, maybe finish those
ones off, get a good yield that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: last you a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can either move on to a
different genotype or you can just keep on
[SPEAKER_01]: growing those two phenos, whether they're
the same cultivar or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the most straightforward
way you can go about it because there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: many different factors that come into
growing and how the plant acts and what
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways you can tackle this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get towards the end of the
episode here, was there any other tips
[SPEAKER_00]: that we didn't talk about in this episode
for how to conduct a successful and
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient phenohunt?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the plant count restriction,
or do you have any advice for beginners,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe those folks that are just getting
started phenohunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to that question,
actually, the key word is efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to work as efficiently as
possible, branch yourself out as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing we can actually take
advantage of as growers, especially if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a healthy growing community or
growing friends around you, is send your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends either clones or seeds of what
you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And have them grow them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you guys can actually work
together, multiplying your plant count
[SPEAKER_01]: from four to eight, or 12 to 24,
and getting a bigger map of what you can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually look for in these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then switching and crossing
accordingly to who likes what and who
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to keep who.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, you can multiply it
even more.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got eight grower buddies,
you can multiply that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be this big project that a lot
of people are involved in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of trust and
communication in that, but it can also
[SPEAKER_01]: make really healthy bonds if you do it the
right way and you have quality people
[SPEAKER_01]: around you who aren't just out for
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then basically just knowing what you
like and knowing what you're going for
[SPEAKER_01]: going in so then you can make a decisive
decision on what you want to keep is
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately going to help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're super indecisive,
like I am, and you're looking for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different possible roadmaps, it can be
very hard to dial in a pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically just know what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully you have good, decent
friends who can help you out with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, these plant counts,
they're, they're a B for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So full name, C word, express 420 on all
other social media, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: Twitter, X, I post on there regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come to CE 420 on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: The link will be in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he said, I stream pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go over like seed shopping streams,
low key content creator streams,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into different topics and doing a
lot of research when it comes to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have polls that you can
vote on for certain content you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, which I think is pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also, I'm playing a game,
which some people are into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called weed shop three, which is
pretty fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's fun to gather around and talk in
the community within that also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's pretty much it that I got
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a couple of projects I'm looking
forward to are this full seed to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: video, um, breeding project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plan on making my own strain soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, just putting out as much
content as I can, uh, with as high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: as I can possibly muster is my mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to CE 420
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also as a pinned comment, so you can
easily get to it, sub up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got some good content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly appreciate it for the second time,
technically, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like it to be a different episode,
but man, I enjoy talking to you a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a definitely fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, I've been having a lot of
fun interacting with you guys as a
[SPEAKER_01]: community lately too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great time seeing what you
guys got going on on your highly
[SPEAKER_01]: uncensored videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, your live chats and the tea with
P is really fun too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just interacting with you guys has been
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always cool seeing you on the chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will let you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took enough of your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time and, uh,
yeah, hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you do too, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next video.
Bye.
