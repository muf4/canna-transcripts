[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main difference is control.
[SPEAKER_01]: In organic growing, I think the control
lies within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas synthetic growing, the control
lies within the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, plastic, plastic's the thing
of the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the plastic away.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I switch over to organic and it's
like, wait, dude, get the plastic back out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five to 10% for watering organic living
soil, whether it be every day or every two
[SPEAKER_01]: to three days, that's what you want to
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm growing in a one gallon pot at a
time, I'm watering probably 400
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliters.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a big, vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those plants were as tall as me and
probably as wide as my tent right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, they were healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were huge and they were healthy and
they were green and all they got was six
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons of terrible tap water every single
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 94.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Lockbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: He grows both indoors as well as outdoors
and recently made the switch from growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with salt based fertilizers, often
referred to as synthetic, to using organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about how he used to grow at
synthetic nutrients and how he now does it
[SPEAKER_00]: fully organic.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Lockbox.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk all about going
from synthetic to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done it, and there are tons of
people out there that are making the
[SPEAKER_00]: switch as well for a variety of reasons,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to get into
your experience making that switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about your grow setup,
environment conditions, feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I even want to get into problems that
you've come across and what you've done to
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigate those problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can we do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go by Lockbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is actually Travis, but I've
always had Lockbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a play on hotbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't get too much into that,
but I'm sure most of the audience will
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of know what that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually didn't get into gardening
at all until I was around 19.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 25 now, so it's still six years later,
until I got serious about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the very first intro to gardening I
ever had was probably the first or second
[SPEAKER_01]: grade elementary school science.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were germinating lima beans,
actually, and we used the paper towel
[SPEAKER_01]: method, which I think is really cool,
actually, that my science teacher taught
[SPEAKER_01]: me that a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so my science teacher, she taught us
about the paper towel method.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put your beans, and it's funny,
these are actually lima beans,
[SPEAKER_01]: actual beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: People call them additional plants beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But had the beans in the paper towel,
soaked them with water, put that paper
[SPEAKER_01]: towel inside of a paper plate on top of
it, gave it plenty of darkness,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in the cabinet for a few days,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few days go by, and behold, you have a
root sticking out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a little kid, it didn't really
fascinate me much at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, science, cool, recess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But fast forward all these years,
and I'm getting into it now, and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference to it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a root stick through on any type of
seed, and it blows my mind, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually only grow additional
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting into sage and other types of
herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get too much into that
right now, but just getting into gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: as medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started as just growing medicinal
plants for one reason, but it's turning
[SPEAKER_01]: into a whole other passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I love gardening at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love looking at trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love looking at flowers and just seeing
things grow in the structure of different
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: A year ago, two years ago, three years
ago, I'd have been like, who is this guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, talking about plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's just how it's happened for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I can't wait for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't plan to ever stop gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, dude, that's kind of how it
happened for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the same way as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Started out with just growing medicinal
varieties and then started growing my own
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never thought 10 years ago,
15 years ago that I would be growing
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, kale, bok choy, herbs,
all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sparked your interest to learn even
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool that you were the
same way as me on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So synthetic versus organic, what is the
difference between synthetic and organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, man, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like my answer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people may not like my answer for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, the main difference is control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic growing, I think the control
lies within the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas synthetic growing, the control
lies within the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that, a lot of people
reference organic as like a battery you
[SPEAKER_01]: build a soil battery, you charge it up for
the plant, the plant takes what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I like Chinese food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love buffets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes it easier for me to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a Chinese buffet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stalking this buffet with food and the
plant comes in and it sits down and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wants some food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that plant do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It hollers at the waiter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, waiter, excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like some orange chicken, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you bring it to me, I'll give you a
$2 tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that sound?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the waiter is like, dude, that's
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm here for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it brings that plant the orange
chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: It eats it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in return, it gives you the $2 tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is like the root giving the extra
date to the microbe who is in return
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing the orange chicken or the
nutrient back to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, I am sitting on my couch
watching television as in the plant is in
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm doing a synthetic system,
that's not happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm walking to my tent every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at my bottles of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking, OK, this is what you're
going to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mixing it at this strength quarter,
half, 3 eighths, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of have no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant's just kind of taking it and
responding, however it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can't choose and it can't say,
I want this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't choose the ratios like it does in
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of being force fed,
so to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Waterboarded, I've kind of come to look at
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may or may not be a good term for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, man, the main difference to me
is control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with talking about you using
synthetics first.
[SPEAKER_00]: All about synthetics, your experience with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll switch over to the organic side
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with the synthetics,
when you used them, what was your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about like, were you in a grow
tent?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was your lighting, container size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you in soil or cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was running the synthetics,
I was growing in a 2 by 4 tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5 foot high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light I had running the tent,
it was a HLG 260 V2 R-Spec, 240 watt
[SPEAKER_01]: dimmable full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a 4 inch ventilation inline fan kit
set on the inside, blowing the air out,
[SPEAKER_01]: negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light, I never actually got it above
70% in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it was at 70%, that was maybe for
like a nine day maximum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I referenced that because that was one
of my problems, like we'll get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was never actually able to push the
plants, whether it be to my maybe lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience and knowing how to push the
plants properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found the higher I turned the light,
I just ran into more problems,
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies, or just burns, toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I always kept that lighter on
70%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kept two fans in that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say keep, I'm still currently running
the exact same setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it right now across the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have two fans blowing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is on the ceiling blowing above the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that that HLG light puts off a lot
of heat, actually converted to a spider
[SPEAKER_01]: former I've got behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's beside the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's blowing the heat around in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another is on the floor of the tent,
blowing the air around there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's as far as I can think for
setup wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I missed anything in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to describe it by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment conditions that you usually
aim for, for like temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually, it's kind of different than a
lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people put a lot of effort and
money into controlling that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day I hope to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not really in the cards for me
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But both of my tents are in my living
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always comfortable for my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always roughly 69, 70 degrees in here
Fahrenheit in the living room and the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity in the living rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always between maybe 40 and 70 in the
tents without controlling or doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything for it, except for the
ventilation and the fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperature maximum on a hot summer
day is about 86 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the minimum would be about maybe 69
degrees lights off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting colder winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like 26 degrees outside a few weeks
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how cold it got in one of the
tents, but the plants, they didn't look
[SPEAKER_01]: too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it was pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have actually one thermostat
between my two tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super budget growing over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine CO2 is something that you
don't supplement as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yes, but no, not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a propane heater right to my
leftover here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might've been Bruce Bugby or Dr.
Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe Jeff Lohempel is one of the two,
but they said just a pilot light from a
[SPEAKER_01]: heater like that just boosts the ambient
CO2 levels in a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to think without doing anything,
I'm kind of supplementing, but actually
[SPEAKER_01]: no, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I like to tell people is I
live in the house that I grow in and me
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaling, like we exhale CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three cats actually that exhale
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, that actually
contributes to the CO2 level, especially
[SPEAKER_00]: when for me, I'm taking the air from the
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exhausting that air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: New air is passively coming in from my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that CO2 that I'm producing is going
into my grow tent and that is sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually funny to me that you say
that you have the three cats in yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my wife and my son who's a year old
and man, I love him to death, but that
[SPEAKER_01]: little dude likes to scream and he likes
to do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm imagining that in itself,
it's probably ample CO2 supplementation
[SPEAKER_01]: right there from my son.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shout out to the baby grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for helping me on that one right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutrient lineup, what were you using
for your synthetic lineup and how did you
[SPEAKER_00]: go about the feedings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well for veg, I was using Botanic Air
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was a CNS 17 grow, I think was the
micros and a kind base was the macros or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe backwards on that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I actually hardly even use these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought these bottles and I could
probably sell them to someone and tell
[SPEAKER_01]: them they're full and outside of the caps
being unsealed, they wouldn't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, um, even when I was growing
synthetic, I've always grown in at least
[SPEAKER_01]: happy frog or ocean forest soil and just
the nutrients that's in the soil already
[SPEAKER_01]: was enough to get me through vegetation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did start introducing veg newts,
usually the last week of veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I would always start at quarter
strength, you know, if it called for four
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliters a gallon, I'm doing one
milliliter a gallon and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: busting it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm only making a liter quarter
milliliter, which actually gets really
[SPEAKER_01]: finicky and annoying on a milliliter drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or with some of these strange numbers,
but, um, I would start there and just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of watch the plant and read the plant to
tell me if it needed more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, in the veg only feeding
late in the veg and I would flip the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and I would actually keep feeding
the veg newts through stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've read a lot of people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it just for the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm liking to think that the veg is kind
of like earth, the stretch, I'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: is like an accelerated veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's probably incorrect because
the hormones with the flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm seeing a lot of STEM growth,
so I'm feeding it nitrogen, veg news.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's about week two and a half,
maybe three, uh, switching up 12,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12, you know, flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually flip over to my blue notes,
which, um, they are advanced nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, sensei bloom, a and B totally
different brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was actually worried about that when
I bought my veg news, I had my blue notes
[SPEAKER_01]: first from my previous run and I went to
buy veg news and I wanted to buy sensei
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a and B same company, same brand,
keep it all the same, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid any kind of interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you hear all kinds of horror stories
online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I put two different brands in my plant
and now my plants falling apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why chemical interactions and
I'm sure it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, I just wanted to avoid that,
but I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got botanic care, advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw any issues with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or maybe I did and I just couldn't
pinpoint that issue to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, as far as I knew, I couldn't
tell, but I would switch that over and
[SPEAKER_01]: again, I'm going back to quarter strength
on the fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I found that I actually was able to
use a lot more flower nutrients than veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, cause they're eating a lot more,
feeding a lot more between maybe weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: three and six, three through six a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've come to know as the heaviest
feeding weeks, but I never actually fed a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant over three quarter strength
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think, um, I always started to
experience problems though, at that point,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, tips burning or just toxicity
is, or just strange issues, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: funky looking leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just imagine pH issues, lockout,
just without actually looking inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: that soil, I feel like that's creating a
mess at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of a scrambled mess on how
I did my feedings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, did you monitor the pH at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do that when they're
growing with the synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you doing any sort of monitoring the
pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yes, I'm proud to say that is the one
thing I actually have been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got myself a $45 think like hydro
mass, master pH man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I felt like a chemist, like a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was finally a grower getting in the
grow, you know, my thoughts have changed
[SPEAKER_01]: on that sense, but, uh, I was always
aiming to get between pH 6.0 and 7.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if it was inside of those numbers,
I was happy with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.1, 6.9.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm growing in the happy frog
soil or ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if it being synthetic,
I'm imagining that soil had enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, pH buffering capabilities to correct
that at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So between six and seven, I was happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there was a few times I tried to
pinpoint it at 6.5, you know, 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the nutrients perfect in the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You eat them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But dude, every time I tried to do that,
I'd be 6.4 pH up, 6.7 pH down,
[SPEAKER_01]: up, down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just get paranoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fixing to feed my plant a chemical
concoction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe add two drops to some,
just still water, get it right between six
[SPEAKER_01]: and seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measuring the pH and balancing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's time consuming, you know,
I mean, mixing up the nutrients and then
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you water in that mixture,
a lot of people check the runoff or
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll do some sort of slurry test to
make sure that they're in that range that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to be in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six to seven pH is the range that a lot of
people go after.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would say that you can go
down to 5.5, 5.5 to 7.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some people that are saying
you can even go lower than that or higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's certainly an optimal range and
then a tolerance range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant may still grow, but it just
might not be optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about PPM or EC?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another measurement that a lot of
people track when they're growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have a TDS tester?
[SPEAKER_00]: Were you measuring PPM or EC at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, I sure wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would have liked to again,
but going back to wife and son and first
[SPEAKER_01]: time or at the time, just budget,
uh, wasn't able to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said, I was eyeballing
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I tried to learn to read the plant
versus read the PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so again, I was looking for signs of
stress, you know, just for, if I added too
[SPEAKER_01]: much, uh, tips burning or just dark,
waxy, just nitrogen toxicity or just leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: curling or just dry, crusty soil or just
anything nasty semen or on the flip side
[SPEAKER_01]: of that, you know, if I was feeding too
light, I'm looking for yellowing or just,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, the plants lost its vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It don't look happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves aren't praying and they're kind
of sagging at this point and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: so, uh, long story short, no, I didn't
monitor PPM with a number and a pen,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I tried to, but, uh, I did water
distilled actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I knew I was starting at zero no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one thing I kind of did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stayed away from tap water at this point
in time because I have no idea what's in
[SPEAKER_01]: it PPM wise or just, uh, I live out in the
country out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my water, man, sometimes it's like
brown when it comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there really is no talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's 180 or shoot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be 600 PPM rather than,
I don't know if that's a reasonable
[SPEAKER_01]: number, but so distilled starting at zero
and then just watching the plant instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of actually checking PPM and same,
same for AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a similar situation where my tap
water is just so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it comes into like 485 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have to use Auro or some sort of
filtered water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I elected to get an Auro system,
you know, make the investment on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 190 bucks or 200 bucks, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, it's beneficial for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people will complain that
you're wasting water with that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I have my drain line hooked up to a
bucket and I'm using on my outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not wasting it, but yeah,
water can certainly be one of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: where if you don't have a good water
source, your plants won't be happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what problems did you come across when
growing with synthetic nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for problems, mainly, um,
inducing toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I ever used the synthetic
nutrients, I read the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I called for 16 milliliters a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I read online, Oh, don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought, well, shoot, man,
I'll try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'll get lucky with this whole
strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, uh, automatically I could tell
something was wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm just beating a dead horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep saying burnt leaf tips,
but I just noticed they started getting
[SPEAKER_01]: red and just start growing and just,
um, the clone too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely experienced a lot of leaf
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I never did really check the soil,
uh, PPM or I'm sorry, pH runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really know what was going on
in that spectrum, but I imagine it was
[SPEAKER_01]: totally out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't pHing at this point in time when
I was using this whole strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was relying on advanced nutrients,
uh, pH perfect, um, little slogan to,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my pH is going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I probably had PPM issues, pH issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my rise of few was probably like a
crazy mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my plants were just unhappy to the
point where I can't even tell you what
[SPEAKER_01]: problems they were at some points in my
synthetic career.
[SPEAKER_01]: You laugh like you might know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come across a wide variety of
problems when growing with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so common and it's so easy to make
mistakes when growing with synthetics in
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it can be, uh, you can
definitely, if you're doing it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can certainly come across with some
really healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people these days still grow with
synthetics and have a lot of good results
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and don't come across any
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, don't get me wrong there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had a lot of issues with my
synthetics, but I also did have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: great results too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not to like toot my horn or anything,
but I don't want to make it sound like it
[SPEAKER_01]: was just all negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I actually loved the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved the results I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the buds I got were just,
man, the frostiest buds I've seen in a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, uh, versus going to medicinal
stores around here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just blown away at like,
I can grow this and it beats the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: of this at this crazy price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, so it was really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my only main reason from straying away
from it, you kind of mentioned it earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: was you just said the time on the mix and
the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of opens the door on my
reasons for switching.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like you said, you can get
great results and I have, but I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to knock synthetics by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like organic all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them both.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have equal places and,
um, I'm all for either one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I switched just for ease,
you know, but yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's some great yourself synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask why you switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it just a time factor yeast?
[SPEAKER_00]: So was there other reasons to make in the
switch from synthetic to organic as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say it was like 95% time factor and
ease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I work in a factory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, right now we've actually cut hours
back to five, six days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the time I was growing synthetics,
we were doing seven days a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 hours a day, 3 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: to 3 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live an hour away from my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was home like eight, nine hours a
day, seven days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was in my tent, you know,
mixing up the nutrients, checking the PPM
[SPEAKER_01]: and my son's in the background crying and
my wife's getting mad at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, it was all this,
I didn't have the time for it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I wanted to keep on growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that wasn't an issue, but the time
spent just having to do all these things
[SPEAKER_01]: was, so I started reading about,
uh, organics and just amending and top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressing and just dry amendments and don't
pH just water and walk in and walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was a huge thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm very fascinated though by soil
food web, soil science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've always been very fascinated by
science and math.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I talk, you probably wouldn't
guess it, but I'd like to consider myself
[SPEAKER_01]: an intelligent person, but I'm very
fascinated by microbes and just the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: food web, who eats who and just the way
that everything interacts down there and
[SPEAKER_01]: just the way the plants will secrete acids
and sugars and extra dates and just
[SPEAKER_01]: wrangle up these microbes and just how
these microbes will go out and work with
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients and bring them to the plant
and that just, they'll change their pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just, man, it just fascinates me
so much how we just, it's like an own
[SPEAKER_01]: little world down there and just
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to get down in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I said earlier, plants,
you're just watching them grow above the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, just the different leaf structure
and also just below the surface,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, just every day I'm listening to
podcasts to and from where you,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm listening to Jeff Lohanfels,
just all these different people talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about the soil food web and just,
man, it's so fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I have so much knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all just, I don't have a lot of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said that wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I listened to all this knowledge and it's
just such a mess inside of my head.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just comes out so fast and
sputters, but man, it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big reason also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating to me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a good segue into
talking about the organic side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: when you made that switch and your
experience and what you've done on the
[SPEAKER_00]: organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you first, did your growth
setup change at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to organic or using the same grow
tent lighting, container size,
[SPEAKER_00]: did that change?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's for the most part the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: One biggest thing that changed,
in my opinion, was the lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light itself didn't change in one
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still the same HLG 260 V2,
but I was actually able to increase the
[SPEAKER_01]: power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I was never able to get 70%
with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't change the height of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't change how the plants,
I didn't change anything I did other than
[SPEAKER_01]: just what I was feeding the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never had to reduce the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw leaves turning upside down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw bleaching tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never saw heat or light stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it seemed like I was able to
put more into the plants with a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was one way the setup changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got another tent behind me since the
time I switched to organics and that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: spider former light SF 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's 200 Watts, not 240 like the
HLG.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it has IR though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the HLG just has far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has far red and IR, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a slight change.
[SPEAKER_01]: One fan in this tent outside of two,
but nothing major.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just small things just here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry, my pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forgot that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing at Fabric Pots running
synthetics, five gal fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was the greatest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, plastics thing of the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw the plastic away.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I switch over to organic and it's
like, wait, dude, get the plastic back out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil is drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on now?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm running plastic pots now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same five gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to go much larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The five gallon is, I feel like it's hands
around the throat of my organic grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did a run in one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried organics in one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two plants did really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: One plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, it was my favorite plant of the three
too, but it was the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stems were so purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves just yellow and crumbly and
brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just was crying for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's out of the question for me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a five gal plastic from our organic
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot of people mention that the
larger the pot, the better when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I actually myself, I just went from
my, I started out doing organics with the
[SPEAKER_00]: three gallons, the five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I moved to the seven
gallons, it was even easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you just got 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm slowly working my way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some people are like 15 gallons
at the minimum, or some people might say
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 gallons at the minimum, but I'm working
my way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got some grassroots fabric pots,
the ones with the, their fabric,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they have the liner on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't dry out from the sides like
normal fabric pots do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to start using those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I hope to see, see some better
growth with the 10 gallons and make things
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit easier when it comes to
adding the inputs in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and watering is a big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of being in a larger pot,
less water I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many variables, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the size of the plant depends on it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously you're going to give less
water to a smaller plant in veg versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger plant in flower, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to, to speak about
water and say that I water less,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I kind of water less with these larger
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a benefit in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm actually really glad you brought
that up though, because I totally forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow over this summer, I did my first
one only ever outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started, it was going to be water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did these in 20 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were fabric actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought 20 gallon fabric pots for
whatever reason, but I actually went
[SPEAKER_01]: organic on this grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was happy frog, organic fruit and
flower, acid loving plants, fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, it was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first it was like every three days,
but then it got hot a summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was having a water six gallons a day
every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even at that point, the plants were
still looking dead every day at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I did an organic run in the 20
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was probably the easiest run I've
ever done because those plants were as
[SPEAKER_01]: tall as me and probably as wide as my tent
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I might be exaggerating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably am.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on my Instagram if anyone wants to
check them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, they were healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were huge and they were healthy and
they were green and all they got was six
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of terrible tap water every single day,
but that's all they needed with that
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and that 20 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so glad you helped me remember
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think generally speaking for those folks
that are going from synthetic to organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you hear a majority of people say to start
in larger containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's one of the beginner
101 from switching from synthetic to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sir, you can do organics in three
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do them in two gallons or one
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done them in, but it's just,
it's a little bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, that the plant will,
plant is more prone to show deficiencies
[SPEAKER_00]: because it dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you have a large plant,
a small pot dries out quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with organics, you need that medium to
be moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the organic matter will break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that process is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: When things dry out, microbes go dormant
and then that process stops and the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: will start to get deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being in a larger pot has been
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, was there anything different with
your environment conditions when you went
[SPEAKER_00]: to organic, you know, temperature,
humidity, CO2, or is it all the same as
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is the synthetics,
they were kind of in the summer or the
[SPEAKER_01]: hotter months of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my organic experience is kind of in
the winter and the colder months of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, like I said, both my tents are
in the living room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the temperature really doesn't affect
that too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humidity, however, though,
I think it's been getting kind of drier
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the cold brings dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know my knuckles are dang sure been
starting to crack here lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside of that, everything is the
same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of what Mother Nature throws at
me is kind of what goes on my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a outdoor version of my indoor
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about organic fertilizer and
amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using and how do you go about
adding them into the system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had mentioned earlier that happy frog
fruit and flower acid loving plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought one bag of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it hadn't really touched the sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm using now is the Gaia Green
Organic Dry Amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I love this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get me talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like a promotion guy for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot, I'd ask them for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd probably say no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, Gaia Green is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the All Purpose 444.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use their Power Bloom 284 and their
Glacial Rock Dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crazy awesome trio in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it online.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, it's awesome how I go about using
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start all my plants in solo cups in a
happy frog or ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't add anything at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just straight soil at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them go about two weeks probably
until the leaves are all going outside the
[SPEAKER_01]: cup pretty well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the roots can hold that soil well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll transplant them into one gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I do that, I'll mix the soil with
three tablespoons of All Purpose 444.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one tablespoon of Rock Dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them grow out in that for a few
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on how long I'm going to bed
them in that pot, if I'm planning to
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant them in two weeks, I'll go
ahead and transplant them another two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks from that point into their five
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll mix that with three tablespoons
per gallon of a two to one ratio of Power
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloom to All Purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a five gallon, that'd be like 10
tablespoons Power Bloom to five
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoons All Purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's to account for I'm fixing to
flip the lights to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to flip my lights to flower
about a week after I transplant,
[SPEAKER_01]: give the roots some strength, space to
grow and time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that nutrient ratio, I think,
gives them kind of the All Purpose to get
[SPEAKER_01]: through that stretch in the veg and then
just that Power Bloom to really take off
[SPEAKER_01]: into flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I'm going to veg for four weeks,
I'll top dress them maybe after two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: and then do the same thing, transplant
after four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing in the five gallon and then
just top dress them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every two to four weeks, depending on how
that plant's doing, what I'm seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll top dress just raw dust or
maybe Power Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really not do this, that at a specific
time or a soil scientist or maybe I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to be, I don't really know what I'm doing
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kind of adding stuff when I see
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that's not how you do organics
when you're seeing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're like eight or nine days
behind from the actual problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to not actually see problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to always stay above that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I follow that two to four week
regimen I found.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that keeps them healthy for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do occasionally see calcium issues or
magnesium issues, the rust or the red and
[SPEAKER_01]: the browning.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that, I'm actually using Epsom salt,
just Dr. Teal's, got it from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pure Epsom salt, none of that other crazy
stuff, cocoa butter, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's for the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe one to two tablespoons every week or
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium, I would like to get some gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't actually gotten around to it,
but that's what everyone always talks
[SPEAKER_01]: about for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's about how I go for my feedings,
top dressing or transplanting every two to
[SPEAKER_01]: four weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with organics, you're not actually
adding in that to water like you are with
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just your top dressing and then
you're adding water on top of that top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you do waterings?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about doing your waterings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should ask you this on the synthetic
side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How were you doing it when you were using
synthetic nutrients versus organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a totally different philosophy and
practice in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was doing synthetics, I was
following the forsaken dryback method.
[SPEAKER_01]: You water the pot, you lift it,
it's so heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wait till it's 40, 30, 20% of that
weight, bone dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you add water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually gone so far as letting the
plant go till it looked like it was dead
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not coming back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I gave it water and just,
I don't plan on ever doing that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But watching that plant come back and
bounce back in an hour was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of helped me learn to not
overwater when I was learning to do
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics just to see how much better
underwatering would be in that regard than
[SPEAKER_01]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, synthetics, I was watering,
letting it dry back completely,
[SPEAKER_01]: adding more water, switching to organics,
totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned earlier, you don't want
that dryness.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want micro dormancy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want the land to go dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to experience a drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want there to be life and moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for that, I'm watering a lot more
frequent than I would have ever been in
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If synthetic me saw organic me watering,
I'd be like, dude, overwatering,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're about to cause so many issues for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there will be times I'm watering
every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And synthetics, that was like,
I'd slap myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually, Build A Soil, man,
I love Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of his YouTube videos I learned from
him, he said, 5% to 10% for watering
[SPEAKER_01]: organic living soil, whether it be every
day or every two to three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want to water for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm growing in a one gallon pot at a
time, I'm watering probably 400
[SPEAKER_01]: milliliters if it's a big, vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on how long it's in that
pot, how big it is, that might be every
[SPEAKER_01]: single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you want to stop that dry
back or, I'm sorry, just stop it from
[SPEAKER_01]: going dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But watering organic, I'm probably
watering every day, whether it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit or a lot, just depending on that
plant, the soil, where I think it's at,
[SPEAKER_01]: but always trying to keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to do the same, well,
I still do, the same dry back method.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually some benefits to doing
the dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically with synthetics, you can
certainly get away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I still do that method to this date.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the watering, it would be water till
runoff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll slowly water in, and then it
will go through the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get that runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people will do testing of
that, the pH, PPM, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with organics, it's often said,
you shouldn't have that runoff because in
[SPEAKER_00]: that runoff is usable nutrients for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do get any sort of type of
runoff, a lot of people, what they'll do
[SPEAKER_00]: is they'll keep it in that plant saucer
and they'll let it soak upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do that same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 5% rule with organics,
I think it's pretty cool that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that I heard from him as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I practice, yeah, I mean, having those
small amounts and watering more frequently
[SPEAKER_00]: helps to ensure that you don't overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're seeing that you're doing a
5% of water, according to your container
[SPEAKER_00]: size, and the plant needs more water,
well then 24 hours later, next time you
[SPEAKER_00]: check in on your plants, for example,
you can give them another 5%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on to PPM or EC, I think you
said you don't have a meter, you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor it with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with organics, so you just
completely kind of hands off when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to EC or PPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah, same thing, just hands off
approach, just kind of putting the water
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just hoping for the best, not knowing
what's inside of it, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: no meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do know though, I've heard a
lot of people talking about, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier, checking the PPM or the pH of
runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've read about a lot of people checking
the PPM of organic runoff, which I know is
[SPEAKER_01]: a very controversial topic because I know
when there is runoff in organics,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all kinds of stuff in that water,
all kinds of organic material that'll play
[SPEAKER_01]: a part of that PPM that's not actually a
nutrition or nutritional matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of that water content, so I don't,
but for people out there, if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something you're hearing about online,
just some bad information, me personally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think you really need to worry
about organic PPM unless you're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: watering into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's still some play to look
there, but no, I don't actually check into
[SPEAKER_01]: that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a vast majority of the people just
ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also ignore it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just top dress and water in,
and the plants turn out to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beauty of organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use any of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at it into the future,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very interested in oregano or just
other kinds of herbs like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll have a pest deterrence property.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you use a clover blend,
if I'm not mistaken, like a four clover
[SPEAKER_01]: blend, or you have in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've seen in your videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of interested by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always just been fascinated with just
the look of that kind of living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the look of a bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a four by four living soil bed with
the moss and just the cover crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it looks like just some soil floors,
like forest floor inside of a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, I plan to use cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'm not, but it is in the
future for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for several reasons, nitrogen
fixation, chop and drop, just look,
[SPEAKER_01]: all sorts of reasons, but it is in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I use the white Dutch clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually came across some negative
impacts that white Dutch clover can have,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the main things is thrips
actually feed off of white Dutch clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm just going to use up the rest
of what I have and then just stop using it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't want thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, definitely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about mulch layers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use those at all when growing
organically?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried a bit of a mulch layer using
mushroom compost, just like a two inch
[SPEAKER_01]: layer, mainly to help try to keep that
soil moist and just kind of give darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a lot of knowledge and mulch
laying or mulch layers, but I've done it a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, but I don't really have a lot
to speak on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just about a two inch layer of
mushroom compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had good results doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say for sure though that it
negatively or positively impacted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do feel I had to water a bit less
though, which was definitely a plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use those at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like everything is just a no,
no, no for me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, I plan to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely want to get into worm compost
and get my own worm compost bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason I'm not right now for worm
compost is just my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very old house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have pest issues, but there very
easily could be pest issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kind of staying away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's an easy way to invite
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my house is naturally loaded with
mites, the kind that'll eat rotting wood
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as living plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think broad mites, maybe little orange
ones that look just like spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I try to stay away from
anything too bug related at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a bad run in my very first grow ever
with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a clone I got, so I don't know if
they came from the clone or from my house,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that just left a very bad taste in my
mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a bug, I try to stay away from it,
but getting into organic, it's not the way
[SPEAKER_01]: of thinking at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic is life and diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, in the future I plan to,
but at this point in time, I can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: say anything on that, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually kind of glad you're saying
no, no, no to cover crops, mulch layers
[SPEAKER_00]: and worms, because that just goes to show
that you can do organics without that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of new folks are
intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, I don't want to deal with
the worms or cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know about that,
so I'm just not going to do organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's a requirement,
but really it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's kind of the next level
where you start off maybe top-dressing
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs, then maybe you're planting
in some cover crops, then maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a mulch layer, then maybe you're
adding in worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different stages, I guess you could say,
but it's certainly not a requirement to do
[SPEAKER_00]: those things when growing organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's actually super awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy to hear you say that,
because I actually have the same thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I've been getting pretty good
results with not a lot of experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: not a big budget, not a lot of going into
it, and a lot of new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I'm on THC Farmer a lot, the forum,
and I saw some guy post a thread,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, this is how you do your first grow,
and it was like a freaking novel,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 paragraphs of go out, buy this,
that, and this, do this, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dude, I don't plan to ever buy
half of that in my entire life,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I don't want that to discourage a lot
of new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want someone like me to kind of not get
seen, but just kind of spread that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get results.
[SPEAKER_01]: With nothing, not nothing, but I mean,
it doesn't take all of this extra inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're saying, to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely helps, and I definitely am
doing better with it, but I'm getting by
[SPEAKER_01]: just fine, and a lot of people can be too,
so for sure, man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use microbial inoculants,
whether it be like mammoth pee,
[SPEAKER_00]: or recharge, or there's so many micro
products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use those at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Favorite word, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes, I wish I could, dude,
I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually at my grow store yesterday
asking about recharge, and they looked it
[SPEAKER_01]: up, real growers recharge, 80 bucks,
and I was like, see you later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish I could, but so I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I am doing, though, is I'm making
some compost teas to try to inoculate with
[SPEAKER_01]: some microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, my compost teas are maybe poison,
because I don't have a pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have air stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally a 24-hour process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of annoyance for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stirring that thing every 30 minutes,
except for when I fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might go two, three, four hours,
but I'm doing like a whirlpool method I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned, where you just stir the crap out
of it, and you get like a vortex going to
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom, which in theory is sucking
oxygen into that water, into that mixture,
[SPEAKER_01]: and hopefully, I've been creating some
microbial inoculants in that form,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe I've just been killing my plants
slowly, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been purchasing any inoculant
products, but I've been trying my best at
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the compost tea, as you mentioned,
can certainly be beneficial as a microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant, and some can argue that it's
more beneficial than using a microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant, because microbial inoculants
are so limited to the amount of diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: that's included in those bottles,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that it's bad and that you
shouldn't use them, but you can certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: get more diverse set of microbes coming
from compost, or even going into your
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard and doing the IMO process,
talking about natural farming,
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to get those indigenous
microorganisms and then bring them into
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get a lot more diversity that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's cool to hear that you're
experimenting with the teas and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: boost up your diversity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody comes across problems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What problems have you come across when
switching over to organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, watering gave me a run for my
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between under watering and just letting it
dry out too much and seeing issues there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then on the flip side, over watering,
just kind of keeping it muddy,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I actually haven't had nearly as
much issue as I thought I would with over
[SPEAKER_01]: watering, but I think I probably still
have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned I've done a one gallon
organic, and that was just a run of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole grow was a problem for three
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One did okay, smallest of the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two was like, eh, and one was like,
I don't even want to say it was my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a walking problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the one gallon, the biggest
problem was just lack of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: lack of battery, I guess, going back to
that battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very easy to eat through nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big thing I've learned lately is the law
of return.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're constantly taking from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants taking from the soil were
taking from the plant, and in this little
[SPEAKER_01]: one gallon, there's not a lot being put
back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been top dressing into it and feeding
into it, but just the amount that that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant's taking just threw it off,
and just lack of nutrients is a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that regard, when you're growing in an
actual pot that's capable of handling this
[SPEAKER_01]: battery, and it's capable of charging up
this plant, really not a lot of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: Springtails had a big old springtail
thing, but I didn't actually see it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, it alarmed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh my God, the soil was
crawling, but I've heard about them
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd known about them, so I wasn't really
worried.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they'll break down organic
matter and actually turn into nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could actually be beneficial,
but still that's just bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still kind of went on my problem list,
but it's really all I can think so far for
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you had any underfeeding issues,
seen any deficiencies or anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: or seen lower yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say once you switch over
organics, you'll initially see a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: yield compared to synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as deficiencies and underfeeding,
yes, but that was usually with the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: pots and transplant thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just towards the end of a two or
four-week cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to stay, like I was saying,
with these cycles above that, so I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: see that, but I did run into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still trying to get it down with the dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it takes several weeks to actually
be broken down, so I'm trying to get that
[SPEAKER_01]: timing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, if I am seeing deficiencies,
it's like a magnesium or a calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing rough spots or just yellowing
with the intervanual chlorosis and just
[SPEAKER_01]: the crumbling dry edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as yield goes ... Technical
difficulties, once again, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a sign that we need to wrap
things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been almost an hour anyways,
and we've gotten through just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone wants to find me, I'm on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lockboxgrows, all one word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty easy to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profile picture is me holding two plants,
just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't miss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on THCfarmers, find me as
lockbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't guess a lot of people probably
are, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the future, man ... Actually,
I turned 25 tomorrow in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be 25 to get a commercial
grower license.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that's what I'm going to
do, but that door is opening up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole lot of growing, whole lot of plants,
and just loving doing it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I got coming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to your
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that

[SPEAKER_00]: Also, subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend, I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode, and I'd love
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'd love to know your methods of
growing, whether you grow synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it different than what Travis has said
here, and organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: With what inputs do you grow with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do watering the same, or do you do
different?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear that down in the comments
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travis, lockbox, thanks so much for coming
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the technical difficulties we had,
I still think it was a valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to learn more about you, how you do
things, and yeah, appreciate you coming on
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye-bye.
