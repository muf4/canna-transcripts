[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and I'm back with
[SPEAKER_00]: another topic video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a vegetable garden update for you this
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right YouTube, vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're growing vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a couple people reach out
and ask to see a vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just cut some peppers, lettuce,
spinach growing right now and figured I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: show it along in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am by no means an expert when it comes
to growing vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only been doing it for about three
years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly outdoors, a little bit indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'm going to show you is indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's definitely a continuous
learning process when it comes to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: just about any plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feedback is welcome down in the comment
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be friendly with it, of course,
you know, abide by YouTube's guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let me know if you want to see
more of these vegetable garden updates in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into the episode,
I want to give a quick shout out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor of today's episode, Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro has a Black Friday sale going
on right now and some of the products you
[SPEAKER_00]: can save up to 18% off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they have several grow lights on
sale, some from their TS series,
[SPEAKER_00]: their FC series, their FCE series and
their SP series.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a few grow 10 kits and I believe
they may add in some grow tents and inline
[SPEAKER_00]: fans as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Mars Hydro website
down in the description section below and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use coupon code Mr. Grow It for an
additional discount on top of their Black
[SPEAKER_00]: Friday sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so here is my vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too impressive, but hey,
I got something going.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a two foot by four foot grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow tent is by AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see I've got a couple
different plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got on the left there, I've got
peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those four containers right there in
the one gallons are bullnose peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right, I've got cut and come again
method I'm doing there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got lettuce on half of the pot and
then I have spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other half of the pot, you can see
my sensor push temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor is hanging down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also the probe from my AC
Infinity inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's there as well, regulating the
temperature and I'm getting alerts to my
[SPEAKER_00]: smartphone when needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, sorry if I sound a little bit
congested here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting over a sickness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sick earlier in the month,
then it started to get better and now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: back to being sick again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of came back, which is super
bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's going away again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thankful.
[SPEAKER_00]: On that avenue, I just a little bit
congested right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all from Baker Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got the Bloomsdale long standing
spinach, butter crunch lettuce,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then bullnose peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the varieties that I'm
growing this round in this two foot by
[SPEAKER_00]: four foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown up the lettuce and the spinach
in the past to my outdoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not grown out the peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to sprout the peppers a while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't actually sprout, but now I'm
lucky I have four here that have sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into the peppers first,
they're looking pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them look healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all in one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medium is a little bit dry right here,
but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also pretty much due for a feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be doing organic nutrients in
these containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be doing earth dust
nutrients by the Green Sunshine Company
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll just top dress in the nutrients
and water them in and it should be good to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see a lot of people growing peppers in
one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure I'd try out this container
size this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size container do you grow peppers
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also any tips for growing peppers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not top these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people for peppers,
they'll do one topping so they'll get a
[SPEAKER_00]: split coming out and many claim that that
will achieve a higher yield, but I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: do any topping this time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just decided to kind of let them grow
naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, love to know any feedback in the
comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also would love to know about the lighting
requirements for these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think these are high lighting
requirements on peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anybody have any details on what the
PP FD should be at the canopy level?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to dial in the light
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right now I'm doing like 200,
300, maybe upwards of 400 PP FD for these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and they're on an 18 six light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't calculated what the DLI is on
that, but these plants seem to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: fine right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if anybody has any details on what the
light level should be, let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: These being grown under the ES 180 V3 LED
grid light overkill for these plants in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is more for medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this light dimmed all the way down
as low as it could possibly go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pulling about 32 watts right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very, very low energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like much more is needed
for these particular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to be growing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So figure to keep them at the low light
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think future stay would be for
me to swap out this light for something a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this light is a $400 light and
this just isn't needed for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using them on my medicinal plants
and had a line around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the lettuce and spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them in a seven gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox farm ocean forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be amending these with organic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe I'm going to be going with the
earth dust nutrients for this as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spinach is not coming in as nicely as I
would like it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if it's just the container
size it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of cluttered, not getting good
leaf growth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if I'm going to continue
to have spinach in this container or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lettuce looks fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually already harvested the
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to continue to harvest this
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned before, I'm doing the
cut and come again methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just kind of cutting off the tops,
working my way around container harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: as I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I want a salad tonight, I will cut
up just enough that I would need for my
[SPEAKER_00]: salad and leave the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy with how the lettuce is
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so happy with how the spinach is
looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably going to kill that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have grown both of these plants outdoors
and the past and I got some great results
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spinach was growing fine outdoors,
but here indoors, maybe it's just in too
[SPEAKER_00]: close of a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's so cluttered in this
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably a gut feeling on why
that's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a little bit there to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely eat that up and I'll
probably fill up the rest of the container
[SPEAKER_00]: with just lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do the whole thing as being lettuce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll get another variety of lettuce
and have it on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for light levels, 200, 300 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's what it's getting right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those folks monitoring light levels,
what PPFD do you usually give for lettuce
[SPEAKER_00]: and or spinach?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you guys like this quick update on my
indoor vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing too crazy, but hey, I got
something going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Able to feed myself and then any that I
don't eat, I can actually put into my worm
[SPEAKER_00]: bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a worm bin now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a video on my worm bin upcoming in
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I got some worms going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermicomposting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully have some good vermicompost here
in the upcoming months and then I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take the vermicompost and feed it
into my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for tuning into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting more congested just by sitting
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still going to leave at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go get some rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all so much for tuning in and
until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Thanks for tuning in and until next time,
peace.
