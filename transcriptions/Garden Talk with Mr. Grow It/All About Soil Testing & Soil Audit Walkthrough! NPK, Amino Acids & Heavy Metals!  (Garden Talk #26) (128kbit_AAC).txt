[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of this mindset that we're
trying to replicate what the roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually see like what's actually
happening in the soil and that's sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible because the system is so
complex and there's so many physical and
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical and biological variables that are
interplaying together that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually see what's happening and the
biggest issue I see here is there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: elevated magnesium at 149 and that's
really gonna prevent the uptake of calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather have that around like 35%
per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants are uptaking those amino
acids it's saving a bunch of energy that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can put toward shoot growth or flower
development or root growth or any number
[SPEAKER_01]: of metabolic activities but ultimately if
I had a magic wand I would reduce your
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen magnesium I might push up your
soluble phosphorus a little bit and your
[SPEAKER_01]: iron and from there things would really
just fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 26.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may know him as the soil
doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a certified crop advisor and has
been in the business of soil and crop
[SPEAKER_00]: health for over eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode we talk all about soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes a look at a soil test that I got
and gives advice on optimal levels and
[SPEAKER_00]: balancing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also talks a little bit about nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, amino acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: and heavy metals.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am here today with Bryant Mason,
aka The Soil Doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually seen you on a couple
different shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw you on one with Brandon Russ talking
about sequestering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was super, super
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also listened to you on Ted Hussey's
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a great episode with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get real deep into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I heard those two, I really
wanted to get you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super thankful to have you on here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode today, what we're going to
go over is we're going to talk all about
[SPEAKER_00]: soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my audience is say mostly beginners
slash intermediate home growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to say a large majority are home
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there are some people out there
that do outdoors and they are commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say indoors mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll talk all about soil tests
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: An introduction to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have a soil test that I got from
Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a soil report and also a saturated
paste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll go over some of the results in
this podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if we have time, we can get into
some of the nutrients and what you know
[SPEAKER_00]: about them, particularly like
macronutrients, maybe like the NPK type
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when we start out the podcast,
we talk about introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you give us a little introduction
about you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I live in Colorado and I am a soil and
crop advisor through the American
[SPEAKER_01]: Association of Agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that means is I help farmers
in various aspects of their operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But unlike other crop consultants,
I specifically focus on nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: management in organic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do help answer questions for growers
about cover cropping and different farm
[SPEAKER_01]: practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really, really focus on nutrient
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do that through extensive soil
testing, tissue testing, plant sap
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all kinds of different laboratory
techniques to really hone in on the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient bottlenecks that are preventing
greater yield or photosynthesis or quality
[SPEAKER_01]: in crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a garden level, I actually before I was
a consultant, I started a business in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado called the Urban Farm Company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we installed raised bed organic
vegetable gardens for homeowners and
[SPEAKER_01]: taught people how to grow their own food
in their backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I built that business for about five
years before selling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we installed probably two or three
thousand vegetable gardens across the
[SPEAKER_01]: front range of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that enabled me to see really sort of
a hyper data set of gardens in different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments and different backyards.
[SPEAKER_01]: With different crops and crop types and
soil types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a sense, we were able to observe
very quickly what was working and what
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned a tremendous amount about
gardening specifically in the high desert
[SPEAKER_01]: in the arid west.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been able to translate that into
more technical and data driven soil
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry and fertility recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work with all kinds of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been working more and more in
soilless media and potting soils in indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also work with small organic veggie
producers, tree fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually currently starting a
peach orchard in western Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my hands in a lot of different
agricultural enterprises and I get to see
[SPEAKER_01]: things from a lot of different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's just in a nutshell kind
of my background.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into talking about soil
testing and the soil audits that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, what is soil testing and why
should growers get them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a soil test is essentially when you
take a sample, an aggregate sample from
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you choose multiple locations around
your garden and you mix it all together
[SPEAKER_01]: into an aggregate sample and you send it
to a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's there's university
laboratories, there's third party private
[SPEAKER_01]: labs and the labs use different data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm sorry, extraction techniques and
they extract the nutrients from the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and give you a chemical nutrient analysis
of what is in your soil because all soils
[SPEAKER_01]: are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see this map behind me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a map of the United States that
shows all the different soil orders and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can just see there's just tremendous
variability and diversity in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really important to to test your
soil to understand what you're starting
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some soils have really, really high
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have really low magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go nutrient by nutrient and
there's infinite iterations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason a soil test is important is
because there are somewhat of gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: prescriptions that exist on the internet,
like feed your tomatoes Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that only works in one specific soil
type or one specific context.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's enough magnesium and you
don't need Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best way to to apply nutrients is
to first figure out what's actually in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil and that's the purpose of a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go a little deeper, what the lab
does is there's a number of different
[SPEAKER_01]: kinds of soil tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's and usually they're specific to
different parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they use different acids and they mix
the soil with an acidic solution that
[SPEAKER_01]: extracts the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I like a soil test called a
malic three and they use an acid with a pH
[SPEAKER_01]: of two point five to extract all the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also like what's called a saturated
paste test, which just uses water to
[SPEAKER_01]: extract the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can go into that more if you'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is there's a lot of
different kinds of soil tests and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of nuance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's important is to choose a lab and
choose a specific soil test and not change
[SPEAKER_01]: because all labs and all protocols and
soil tests are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to stick with one over
time and really calibrate to one specific
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the most popular testing
facilities is Logan Labs and that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: one I went through from my soil report
that I have in the saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can either go through a lab or
like on Amazon, you can buy the home test
[SPEAKER_00]: kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some video where this guy did a
test on the home test kits and he compared
[SPEAKER_00]: it to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he had a couple of different home
test kits and one was like extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: inaccurate and one of them was like pretty
pretty on point to what he saw got from
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in your opinion, are home soil tests
worth it or is it really kind of a waste
[SPEAKER_00]: of money?
[SPEAKER_01]: I fall in the latter camp where I think
it's a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me explain why.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's essentially two reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first is that they're not very
accurate compared to what a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use equipment like an inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big name for a piece of equipment
that costs about $200,000 and is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate in identifying each and every
macro and micronutrient down to the part
[SPEAKER_01]: per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the garden kits are not accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's a color metric type of thing
where you're matching the color to a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain chart that tells you the level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's not my biggest issue with it
actually because precision, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: super, super accurate data isn't
necessarily the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal of a soil test is just to give
you direction in terms of what you should
[SPEAKER_01]: be applying and what you shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the accuracy thing while it is surely a
problem isn't the reason I think these
[SPEAKER_01]: tests are a waste of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real reason is that if you use one of
these kits, usually there's not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: standard or target level that you'd be
familiar with using these kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may say high, low or medium,
but the reality is you really need to see
[SPEAKER_01]: data over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've probably seen five or ten
thousand tests from Logan Labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm hyper calibrated to Logan Labs test
reports.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to change labs, whether it's a
home test kit or another commercial lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: the data would essentially be unhelpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the biggest issue for me around
these home test kits is that they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really give you a good quality baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think high, low and medium is
actually a very good approach to managing
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's better to either have a
consultant or an agronomist, even if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: with the commercial lab, doing the
interpretation because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: nuance in interpreting a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of my two cents on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also mention that I've used home test
kits where I've taken the same soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tested it twice and the results were
different between the two tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that didn't really give me much
confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, there's a difference
between getting a soil test and seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: results and then knowing what actions to
take after the fact or getting consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where soil audit comes into
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us about soil audit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me add one thing to the last
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pH, a home pH test I think is pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to figure out if your pH
is five or eight, I think it's totally
[SPEAKER_01]: worth it to do a simple pH test with a
litmus paper or whatever the test is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those tend to be accurate enough to
actually get a sense of if you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing your pH or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just want to add that when it comes
to soil testing, there's kind of this
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset that we're trying to replicate
what the roots are actually, like what's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually happening in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of impossible because the
system is so complex and there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: physical and chemical and biological
variables that are interplaying together
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can't actually see what's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these soil tests are just a proxy to
give us sort of a sense of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, the purpose of me saying that
is there isn't, I'm not here to promote
[SPEAKER_01]: one specific soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's key is to get comfortable
with one as a proxy and be able to relate
[SPEAKER_01]: that to plant health and stick with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get into the soil audit,
what I do, I probably do 20 to 30 of these
[SPEAKER_01]: a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: My primary role as a consultant is growers
send their soil to Logan Labs and they get
[SPEAKER_01]: two separate soil tests on the same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is the Malik three, which I already
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called a standard test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other is a saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Malik three is a strong acid
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks at what's theoretically available
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the nutrients kind of like the bank
account of nutrients and the paste test is
[SPEAKER_01]: on the other end of the spectrum and it's
showing what's immediately available
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all the theoretically available
nutrients, just what's soluble in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the soil solution is a term for the
water in the pore space of the soil that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants roots have access to right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water that's actually uptaken by the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pace test is a really, really good
test to see what's what the plant roots
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually swimming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I look at both of these tests from
Logan Labs and I do a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomic math and write recommendations
for growers on how to amend their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be, and most of the time this is
a pre-plant recommendation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before the season or before they put in
their new round of indoor plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: they send me the soil tests and I write a
recommendation of how many pounds per
[SPEAKER_01]: cubic yard of soil they should apply of
let's say alfalfa meal or gypsum or a
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrient like manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go nutrient by nutrient and I write
customized recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal that I, the approach that I
take is the first thing I'm trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is achieve sufficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to make sure there's enough
of every nutrient in the soil for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants to be healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this varies by species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a recommendation for lettuce is going
to look different than for tomatoes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second thing I'm aiming for
is balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very important to have balance
between the different nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there needs to be enough calcium and
there needs to be enough magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there also needs to be a good balance
between those two nutrients to optimize
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient uptake by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the recommendations or the audit
that I do is giving people more
[SPEAKER_01]: information about what their soil looks
like and the chemistry of their soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's also a very actionable
recommendation of how to amend their soil
[SPEAKER_01]: to move it closer to sufficiency and
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really a soil audit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're $40 per test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually I can turn them around within
24 hours of receiving the soil test
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then growers can actually take it and
implement it immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the beauty of my business is I get to
see over time how the nutrient levels in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've really calibrated very,
very accurately to hit specific PPMs in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil using organic amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've optimized it for a number of
different crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a model at this point that gets
pretty, pretty close in pre-plant
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to touch back on the pricing,
you had mentioned $40 for, is that just
[SPEAKER_00]: for the audit or does that also include
the testing through Logan Labs?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the audit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the $40 goes to me and that's for the
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil test through Logan Labs cost $55
for both the standard and the saturated
[SPEAKER_01]: paste test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the growers can either purchase that
directly through Logan Labs, or they can
[SPEAKER_01]: go through my website and purchase it as a
package with the soil test and the audit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter to me,
but that's kind of how the pricing works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like for home growers, if you're
reusing your soil and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once a year maybe get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your soil tested or in between grows or
what is the general recommendation for
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it really depends on the economic
value of the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So commercial growers I work with who are
growing really high value medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are testing every two weeks because any
increase in yield pays for itself a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred fold because the tests,
you know, a hundred bucks every two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: for nutrient management is nothing
compared to the yield that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a home gardener and it depends
on how serious you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an enthusiast, if you're kind of
a hobbyist, once a year is the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say every time you plant,
every time you're, you're replanting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should, you should test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my garden, in my vegetable garden,
I test once a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put down the amendments and I let things
rip.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm really trying to optimize
specific plants, my medicinal garden
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, I'm testing usually once before
planting and then once in badge
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately before flower to really give
myself the opportunity to top dress or
[SPEAKER_01]: just see where things are to adjust my
feed, my liquid feeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the minimum amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I'd mentioned is I
recommend that if you're going to test mid
[SPEAKER_01]: season, you also do a tissue test and a
tissue test is where you take,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, leaves off of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You send it in again, Logan lab says
tissue tests for $40 a pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you can actually see the nutrient
concentration in that the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what I like to say is the plant
doesn't lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just because you can have a,
you can have a perfectly, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficient and balanced soil, but at the
end of the day, the plant is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide, um, what it uptakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to have a soil test alongside a
tissue test is really the best thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a home grower, I think what I would
recommend if you're really an enthusiast
[SPEAKER_01]: is to do one soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before planting and then one soil test
right around that time when the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioning from a vegetative state to a
reproductive state with a tissue test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into the soil tests that I
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I sent it over to you prior to
filming today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is just the regular test and then
also the saturated pace test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't go over every single line item
there, but maybe just take a look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of what stands out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of general recommendations,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me walk through how I would,
how I would look at a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I'm looking at is the
standard soil test, which is in blue and
[SPEAKER_01]: gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you, when it's received from
Logan labs, the saturated pace test is
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of in a pink orange color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first thing I look at on the standard
test is about the sixth line down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says organic matter percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives me an indication of if it's
top soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil that has sand, silt and clay,
or if it's soilless media or potting mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's primarily composed of peat moss,
coco core, aggregate and compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I see here is that the
organic matter is 57%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that indicates to me that it's a
soilless media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of a, of a, um, engineered
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is typically used for high value
crops in indoors or in, in raised beds or
[SPEAKER_01]: in pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, you really only want to use
soilless media in pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to use a top soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I first determined if it's top soil or
soilless media and that, that totally
[SPEAKER_01]: changes how I analyze things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it completely changes the analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll walk through how I do soilless
media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next thing I look at is the pH pH of 6.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think anywhere from like 6.0 to 7.2
is a great range for soilless media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, plants tend to do just fine in the
high fives, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you start to see issues with calcium
uptake below six and micronutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, issues that really appear visually
below about 5.5, but it kind of depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so 6.6 is perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 6.4 to 6.6 is really optimal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually I'd say 6.4 to like 6.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: And okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next thing I look at, I skipped
sulfur and I looked at the, it says malic
[SPEAKER_01]: three phosphorus and it's reported in,
in pounds per acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: P two Oh five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like that around about 1500,
but it really depends too on how well that
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus is, is, um, becoming available
in the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pop over to the pace test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to be jumping between the
pace test and the standard test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that the phosphorus on the
saturated paste report is 2.88 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a great level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think you necessarily need to
have more phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might apply maybe five cups of bone meal
or soft rock phosphate just to keep moving
[SPEAKER_01]: that phosphorus number up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately biology is going to cycle
that phosphorus into availability and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and create good availability right around
three PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I keep working down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I skip on the standard test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I skip the exchangeable cations,
calcium mag and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would not skip those on a top soil,
but for soilless media, I, I much prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: to look at the saturated paste report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the reason for that is because
soilless media doesn't actually have any
[SPEAKER_01]: clay in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And clay is what, when you're looking at,
um, the cation balance in these,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Malik three is developed for top soil
where clay is holding different cations
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clay has a, a slight negative charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it holds these positively charged
cations, um, but because soilless media,
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have that, I'd rather just see
what's immediately available, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pop over to the pace test and I look
at calcium mag, potassium and sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is at 170 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's very sufficient, pretty good
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, magnesium is 149, potassium is 230
parts per million and sodium is 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I look at that great calcium
levels, great, pretty, pretty high
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Levels really low sodium, which is great
because sodium is not actually a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to minimize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to absolutely minimize sodium in
your soil because it's going to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those four cations are going to
compete with one another for plant uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those are sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next thing I mentioned is balance and
it's really important that these are
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest issue I see here is
there's this elevated magnesium at 149 and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really going to prevent the uptake
of calcium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would rather have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Around like 35 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it's, it's much higher than I
would want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's reflected in that percent
magnesium on the, on the pace report.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a little bit lower, um, in white it's
magnesium is 44% of the cations on the
[SPEAKER_01]: pace report.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have it at about 15 to 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing, one little trick is I
actually like to have Epsom salt,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is magnesium sulfate on hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to run magnesium levels low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I need, if a certain cultivar
needs more magnesium, I like to apply a
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar spray of Epsom salt to just kind of
help it along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really maximizes the calcium and
potassium uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so anyway, there's a whole,
there's a whole game.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of an art game with balance
when it comes to cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of my biggest issues with Cal Mag
is there's too much magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you start to see these elevated
magnesium levels, which can come from Cal
[SPEAKER_01]: Mag, dolomitic lime, compost, a lot of
compost are high in magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a major issue, this is very common,
um, is high magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this isn't going to create toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably won't even see it in your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still have really, really healthy
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you, if you're really trying to
maximize and optimize the yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, um, you want to get that
magnesium down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take a breather for a second and take
a sip of tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any questions at this point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think just basic question would be
like you had mentioned, uh, foliar spray
[SPEAKER_00]: for magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be like kind of the ratio,
the recipe for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I say a tablespoon per gallon of Epsom
salt, uh, per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do it's like one to three
teaspoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and I think it's forgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never applied it more than that,
but I'm sure you could do two tablespoons
[SPEAKER_01]: with no issue, but I'm all about frequency
over intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would much rather apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three foliar sprays, maybe four days
apart, then, then do one massive
[SPEAKER_01]: application because the reality is the,
the phyllo plane, the leaf can't uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that much in one, in one fell swoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, frequency is always better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's some folks that say you
need to, you should be spraying at a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, is there a recommendation for,
for you on when the spray should happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are stomata, which are
specialized guard cells in a leaf and they
[SPEAKER_01]: open and close, uh, and they're critical
for photosynthesis because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: exchanging gases, CO2 and oxygen and out
of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turns out that stomata can actually
uptake nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best time to spray is when the
stomata are open and that will maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient uptake in the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most stomata in, uh, in dicots,
which are the majority of the plants we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing are dicots are on the underside of
the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you apply your foliar,
you kind of want to aim up if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you want to apply it when the
stomata are open, which tends to be early
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning or later at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, really it's a function of vapor
pressure deficit or VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high, you know, when it's, when it's
humid and kind of cool, that's when you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be applying, um, because in,
in the middle of the day when the VPD is
[SPEAKER_01]: high, the stomata close because they're
trying to preserve, um, water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to lose too much water,
uh, in hot, dry environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's definitely what I'd
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers do it first thing in the
morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or, you know, real late at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I also, if you're indoors,
I turn my lights down when I do foliar
[SPEAKER_01]: applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was some concern,
some people that, uh, the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the light will come down and kind of act
as a magnifying lens on those droplets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that could burn your plants or,
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it depends on the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in Epsom salt, probably not,
but a lot of the IPM products for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're using synthetic,
like a calcium chloride that could really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it just depends on the style of grow
and the product being used and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me keep, let me keep walking through
this test.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that covers the phosphorus and the
cations and the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the next thing I look at on this
saturated paste report is the soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So soluble salts is essentially the same
as EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what you'd usually see as an EC of
one, um, you multiply that by six 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the, the soluble salts are,
are just an aggregate measurement of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the total nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the soil solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is, um, 1800 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty high level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, most plants may be beans and more
sensitive veggies wouldn't like those
[SPEAKER_01]: levels, but heavy feeders, um,
you know, your medicinal garden plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, even peppers can really handle
those high levels and will thrive at those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't want to push my nutrients
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the sweet spot is actually,
um, for, for indoor cultivation right
[SPEAKER_01]: around like 900 to 1200.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right around a thousand, I think is,
is all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, this just gives a sense of how
heavily this soil should be fed or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, amended.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, um, there's total
sufficiency at these levels and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: really just going for balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So reducing the magnesium, um,
maybe reducing the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump down to chloride.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like chloride less than 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your chloride's at 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: There.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bicarbonates are 43.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bicarbonates really aren't an issue,
uh, below a hundred or 120.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's no issue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bicarbonates can, can tie up nutrients,
uh, because it's a, it's an anion,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it can, it can tie up iron and
magnesium, um, in alkaline environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I go to sulfur on the pace test,
which is a much better and more accurate
[SPEAKER_01]: measurement than this, the standard test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like your sulfur is 75 parts
per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 40 is the minimum for medicinal
plants, 20 for veggies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sulfur just comes in naturally through
most amendments that are bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So gypsum, for example, is calcium
sulfate, uh, potassium sulfate or
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these are just naturally bringing in
sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you usually have elevated sulfur
just from the application of gypsum or,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some, a product like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next I jumped down to the
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at boron iron, manganese,
copper and zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, copper and zinc, I always look at on
the standard test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the standard test, you have,
um, 0.96.
[SPEAKER_01]: So less than one PPM of copper and 1.7 PPM
of zinc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally depends on the crop, but I would
want to move both of those levels up with
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of copper sulfate and zinc
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, all the amendments that I
recommend are organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, if a soil test validates that you
need micronutrients, you, you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: trace mineral or micronutrient sulfates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, looking at boron iron and manganese on
the paste report, um, boron at 0.24 is
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, iron at 0.17 should probably go up and
manganese at 0.28 is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always want iron to be higher than
manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'd want iron maybe at 0.75 and
manganese maybe at 0.4 or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your manganese is actually pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest priority here is iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two ways to get iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use iron sulfate or you can use a
product like blood meal that's naturally
[SPEAKER_01]: high in iron, um, to fulfill your nitrogen
requirement and get iron as a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump over to nitrogen because
nitrogen is the final thing that I would
[SPEAKER_01]: look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's on the standard test at the
very bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in the other category, there's
ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two different forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two different, um, they're two
different molecular forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nitrogen is a really interesting
nutrient because there's actually multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: forms of nitrogen that the plant can
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, they act very differently in
the plant and in the soil for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ammonium is NH4 plus it's a cation and
nitrate is NO3 minus, which is an anion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in most soils, um, what happens is an
organic amendment will go into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just say soybean meal is applied
to the soil and the microbes feed first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the microbes break it down,
mineralize it into ammonium, and then very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly, another set of microbes takes it
from ammonium and converts it into
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens is over the course of
maybe two weeks in a warm, moist
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, you'll see almost all of your
nitrogen in the nitrate form.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sure enough, there's only one PPM of
ammonium and 420 of nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that your amendments have
fully mineralized or broken down,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and nitrate is definitely the
preferred, uh, form of nitrogen for most
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unless you're growing rice or
something, you really want nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: not ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I think it, and, and nitrogen
management is totally context dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is if you're growing
in pots, it depends on the volume of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing in, um, top soil,
it's, it, it changes everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because in top soil, you're also,
I also look at how much nitrogen is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be contribute, contributed by the
organic matter breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the nitrogen calculation may be a
little bit too, uh, detailed for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what I'd say is you'd want,
I think nitrate is, is good at about a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred parts per million for heavy
feeding crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a bit high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say the combination of your
magnesium and your, and your elevated
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate is what's leading to that slightly
elevated soluble salts level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you could, um, the good thing is
that in soil is media after harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could, you could leach your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just run like, you know,
water through your soil until about six to
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 inches of water leaches out the bottom
of your pots or your beds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would bring the nitrate down and
the magnesium down dramatically,
[SPEAKER_01]: probably cutting it anywhere from like 50
to 80%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the different cultivars of heavy
feeding medicinal plants will perform way
[SPEAKER_01]: differently at these nitrogen levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for most cultivars, in my experience,
you'll get, uh, your internode spacing
[SPEAKER_01]: will be too, too wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, and the flower buds will be a
little bit too kind of loose and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the nitrogen is elevated,
you can also screw up, um, the profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, terpenes and different
aromatic substances can really be
[SPEAKER_01]: decreased.
[SPEAKER_01]: At those nitrogen levels with sensitive
plants, like, um, I'm trying to think
[SPEAKER_01]: there are certain veggies that would
actually be burned at those levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd start to see like the traditional
burn symptoms of necrosis on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the outer leaf edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for, you know, legumes for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and other sensitive plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall it's pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a couple of areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be improved upon, but yeah,
that's, that's pretty much, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much it for the audit part.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the analysis is, you know, there's a
lot to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it totally depends on if it's topsoil
or soilless media, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration totally depends on the soil
volume, the cultivar, the species,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but ultimately if I had a magic wand,
I would reduce your nitrogen magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might push up your soluble phosphorus a
little bit and your iron and, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and from there things would really just
fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there was one, uh, talking a little
bit deeper about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was one, I think it was your
Instagram video you made on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe it was something along the
lines of like 18% of the energy has to do
[SPEAKER_00]: with converting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, what happens in the plant is the
plant uptakes either ammonium,
[SPEAKER_01]: or nitrate or amino acids, which is an
organic form of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a third form of nitrogen that
the plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, they, they act totally
different depending on what happens when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to nitrate, which is what the
vast majority of nitrogen is taken up as
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant has to convert that nitrogen in
the form of nitrate into complete proteins
[SPEAKER_01]: to actually put into its leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen is sort of the backbone of
proteins, um, in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it actually has to take that NO3
molecule and, and make it into a protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that process is metabolically,
uh, very energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I've heard, and I heard
this in a podcast, um, put out by John
[SPEAKER_01]: Kempf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't, I haven't been able to validate
it in a textbook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that upwards of 18% of the plant's
metabolic energy is used to convert
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate into complete proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in theory, there's a, there's a sort of
a hack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that if you can feed the
plants amino acids, so, uh, amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: are the building blocks of proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can feed them a soluble amino acid
that they uptake, they don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert it into proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to spend as much energy
because it's already in that building
[SPEAKER_01]: block of an amino acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I really like, um, there's a,
there's like a soluble, there's a number
[SPEAKER_01]: of soluble organic amino acid products
that are in liquid form that you can feed
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like soluble soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like four different brands,
um, that are probably all manufactured by
[SPEAKER_01]: the same company and just branded
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the theory goes that if your plants
are uptaking those amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's saving a bunch of energy that they
can put toward shoot growth or flower
[SPEAKER_01]: development or root growth or any number
of metabolic activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure if that actually works.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way to actually test that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do know that plants perform
extremely well when you feed them soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but the question is really do the,
do the roots uptake it first or do the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes get it first?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it goes in the soil and the
microbes, um, get it first, then they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to convert it into ammonium and then
nitrate and the plant's going to have to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert it back into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the plants can uptake it,
in amino acid form, it's definitely,
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a superior way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's really good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super intrigued when I heard that,
you know, amino acids hack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hearing more and more about amino
acids and how they're beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there are some nutrient
companies that they're using them as kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like a primary thing for uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, that's super cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also mention that there's the
most efficient form of foliar for
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to, if you're going to
find nitrogen foliar, um, you want to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you want it to be an amino acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, they're definitely more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but at the end of the day,
almost all of these organic amendments are
[SPEAKER_01]: in protein or amino acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because they're dry and in chunks,
if you can imagine soybean meal or any
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of meal, feather meal, blood meal,
they're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes have to, have to mineralize
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in a liquid amino form,
it's much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, they're, they're very
popular, really, if you ferment any
[SPEAKER_01]: organic substance, it's going to end up in
amino acid form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk, uh, let's get a little bit
deeper into phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is the primary function that I
think of is just energy transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so phosphorus is the, you know,
the primary, uh, element in ATP,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of the, the energy transfer,
uh, money in, in cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all metabolic processes needs energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is the main energy source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, phosphorus isn't needed in
as high as quantum in as high of quantity
[SPEAKER_01]: as most people think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, if you push nitrogen,
traditionally people have pushed night or
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, phosphorus way too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can create major environmental
issues, especially outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't necessarily believe in,
in really pushing soluble phosphorus in
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor environments because it really,
it's leaky, it leaves the farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: it leaves the garden and ends up in
ecosystems and really wreaks havoc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, phosphorus is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, you definitely need to have a
certain concentration of phosphorus in the
[SPEAKER_01]: root system for root growth and for flower
development and, um, for just reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: energy in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's oftentimes overdone in,
uh, conventional systems, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: people are using phosphoric acid or mono
ammonium phosphate or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: triple super Foss, but underdone in
organic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I like to, I like to have luxurious
levels of phosphorus in organic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that in some of these bottled
nutrient lines in particular that they way
[SPEAKER_00]: overdo it in phosphorus, uh, that it's
just, it's an overkill and then people are
[SPEAKER_00]: adding PK boosters on top of it and
flowering and that's causing problems down
[SPEAKER_00]: the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, now will phosphorus in excess of that,
will that lock out other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hydroponically, we have to have a
hundred PPM to start, but, but absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll start to antagonize or lock out
other nutrients such as zinc, iron,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a lot of the, I mean, it's a,
it's an anion, so it'll lock out any
[SPEAKER_01]: cationic micronutrient, which is zinc,
iron, manganese, um, and copper,
[SPEAKER_01]: but really zinc and iron are the ones to
be, uh, aware of the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, moving on potassium, talk to us a
little bit about potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is a fascinating one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is responsible in the plant for,
and by the way, when I, when I do this
[SPEAKER_01]: very quick overview of what these things
do in the plant, these three nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: really all the macronutrients are
ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have so many roles in the plants that
you would have to be a PhD in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology to even understand all the
different roles of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So high level stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm saying what they do, maybe one or
two things, but they, they have their hand
[SPEAKER_01]: in almost every metabolic function.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I think of potassium,
I think of, um, the, it's, it's like cell
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the opening and closing of stomata and
the movement of nutrients through the
[SPEAKER_01]: xylem and the translocation of nutrients
and carbohydrates, it's all about
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium because it's, it's, um,
it's a very high concentration calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps open and close,
um, cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, potassium is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also as if people who, um,
are growing for flowering, flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: plants know that, um, whether you're
trying to size up an apple or a tomato or
[SPEAKER_01]: a medicinal flower, you, you need to have
a lot of potassium in the reproductive
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so to me, there's this very
interesting relationship that I focus on a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot between calcium and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both cations with positive charges
and they're both very antagonistic to one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to really push calcium and veg
and try to maximize the plant uptake of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in flower, when you're really
trying to fill flower and hit yield and
[SPEAKER_01]: create density, you want to, you want to
switch that ratio and really be pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, potassium in the soluble
form, there's a number of different
[SPEAKER_01]: organic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was about to say potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Considered organic unless you're using it
for IPM, but, um, I don't have any issue
[SPEAKER_01]: with it whatsoever, but potassium sulfate
is what I tend to recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you can really push, uh,
potassium levels up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed that it has a bit of a,
of a delayed effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to size a flower,
it's not going to be a 24 hour effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be applying it like weeks in
advance of when, um, the flowers are
[SPEAKER_01]: really sizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the rule of thumb I use is like a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers, uh, understand the idea of like
the plants stretch, like at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch, that's when I really hammer down
on potassium.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, there are some growers out
there that swear by potassium towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, and I do too, I think that's
critically important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The interesting part was there is you said
after stretch is really when you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when would you stop applying it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Couple of weeks before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it totally depends on your,
and this is why soil testing is so
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on your soil levels,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into flower and you're at where
you are at two, two 30, I don't think I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: apply potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but in a perfect world, your,
your calcium is at one 70, your mags at
[SPEAKER_01]: 35, your potassium is like under a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then once you enter flower,
you've got to get that up to over 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you really just got to
hammer down on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it depends on where your soil is at
and it depends on the tissue levels too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like if you haven't loaded calcium,
then you may not need as much potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's important to kind of
understand that it's, it's hard to give a
[SPEAKER_01]: set recommendation, but in general,
in general, um, feeding potassium is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the interesting thing about
potassium is it's not going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants like potassium won't lock
anything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It won't antagonize anything because
plants, most plants have, um, the ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to uptake luxury.
[SPEAKER_01]: Levels of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can just keep up taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can eat it like candy and just store
it in vacuoles or in different cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: constituents and not use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they like to just uptake it in luxury
levels and it's not going to tie anything
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's not going to hurt to feed
potassium and flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I don't have an issue saying
that because I don't think it's a major
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental concern outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone's slamming down on a
phosphorus during flower, that bothers me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone's slamming down on potassium
excessively, it's, it's not that I give a
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to touch on one more thing and
that is heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I know you did the talk with Tad
Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went into detail with heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like on the commercial facility
side of things, it's, it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they can fail testing for heavy
metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the home growth side of things,
we don't really hear about that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can you talk to us about heavy metals?
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil and plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the interesting thing about heavy
metals is I think that it's, it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit overhyped, but, but not overhyped.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is if you fail your tests,
you have huge economic loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, so it's this, this high risk,
low probability event, and those are the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's what that's usually in life
where there's a high risk, low probability
[SPEAKER_01]: event, you buy insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, for a fire or whatever,
but you can't buy heavy metal insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal is you just try to minimize a
few risk factors that may be contributing
[SPEAKER_01]: to heavy metal failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first obviously is genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, plants, medicinal plants are
often, uh, just natural hyperaccumulators
[SPEAKER_01]: and different, different, uh, cultivars
have a much higher proclivity to
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulate heavy metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so part of the failure issue is just
growers have just certain cultivars that
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately accumulate it in high
quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But beyond that, um, there are certain
inputs that bring in heavy metals and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and there are certain soil conditions,
specifically, um, pH and redox,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like how saturated your soil is,
um, that will influence the uptake of
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually heavy metals are coming in
through a bad compost source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes historically biosolids have
a lot of high, so compost made from
[SPEAKER_01]: biosolids, which is like municipal sewage
sludge, um, have a lot of heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_01]: which sounds disgusting, but it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff performs super well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it performs extremely well,
but it often has higher heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, inputs like kelp meal, which is such a
staple in the organic program for most
[SPEAKER_01]: growers can have, it pretty much always
has elevated arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little bit, a little bit is fine,
but if you're applying huge amounts of
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp meal, you could start seeing
failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, again, depending on the cultivar,
soft rock phosphate and rock dust,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are mined products often have
elevated heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of brand specific from my
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want to make sure you're
sourcing the right amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I help growers source amendments that
have been screened and they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: lowest levels of heavy metals if they're
going to get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then it kind of depends on the
state, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because some states don't test,
some do, and some tests the levels can be
[SPEAKER_01]: really rigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some states test for barium, some don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's kind of, again, context
specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the final thing is just foliars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most, most people avoid foliar applying
their, um, final product, whether that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable, a melon or a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so if you're foliar applying,
um, kelp meal on your flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to, you have a hundred times
higher likelihood of failing than if you
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just want to be very conscious of
foliars and then all the brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, just any org certified organic
product has to get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to meet certain, I would say
fairly rigorous standards for heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm, I have the heavy metal levels
of all organic products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, at my disposal and so I can actually
just look, if a product's not certified
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and it's from some bottle nutrient
company, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're really trying to minimize
that risk, you really need to either have
[SPEAKER_01]: those products tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or I would say demand from the
manufacturer that you get test results,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, or you need to eliminate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I do is I help growers use the
raw mineral ingredients and put together
[SPEAKER_01]: customized fertility programs so they can
get off bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying, I mean, I have bottle
nutrients in my shed right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: just because if I need to do a quick fix,
I can just slam it with something quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but ultimately I'd say that's a big
question mark in commercial operations in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of figuring out where heavy metals
are coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thing I'll mention is that Logan
labs does heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do all the EPA 503 heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for 150 bucks, you can test your soil
and actually see what the heavy metal
[SPEAKER_01]: levels are in addition to the nutrient
analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so those are my thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more thoughts that get more
technical.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, I don't think it's that
it's, it's too theoretical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I understand when cadmium becomes
available, but I don't think it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant conversation to the home grower
or even to the commercial grower because
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things just are out of the,
out of control of a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not going to change the redox
state of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not realistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good stuff there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything special you got
upcoming in the future that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've got a, I've got a number of
things in the works that I can't wait to
[SPEAKER_01]: launch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's some really exciting
things that I'm going to launch in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say the best way to follow me is
on Instagram, um, soil underscore doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't posted for a while because the
busy season just sweeps me away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting an orchard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm helping hundreds of growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not producing content, but I will be
as things slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So follow me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can order.
[SPEAKER_01]: So audits, um, consulting phone calls,
anything you want on my website,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is soil, doctor, consulting.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Bryant's Instagram
