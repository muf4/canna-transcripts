[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast where
we interview growers from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 163.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Macho Grams,
Gramsby Savage.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a fellow content creator with nearly
2,000 subscribers, and he grows both
[SPEAKER_00]: organically and synthetically,
and that's what we're going to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: The medium, feedings, pH, PPM,
and more will be compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: Macho reveals several things that he does
in his garden when growing both ways in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to get better plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips

[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm alright.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today, brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met in person a couple times.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple times already now, yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually the growers gauntlet was
the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never forget when we were done with
the event, AC Infinity was giving away
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the equipment that was there,
and one of the things they were giving
[SPEAKER_00]: away was a grow tent, and it was all fully
assembled and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't think anybody wants
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walk outside and I talk to you,
and I'm like, you're giving away a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, does anybody want it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, yes, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you live in Illinois, so getting it
from California to Illinois, you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: went so far to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you mentioned it, because a lot
of people didn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people didn't believe that you
were the reason that I actually came home
[SPEAKER_01]: with a 4x4 from the trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was cool, man, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate you hooking me up,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think they were going to be
giving away all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people had lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even in boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good event though.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm glad you decided to come
onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about growing a
couple of different ways here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing organics and synthetics,
you grow both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important to know some
of the differences between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know me personally, when I first
started, I was growing with synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I switched over to organics and I
was trying to do the same things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was doing with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some things that are
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going through today and finding out how
you do things, growing both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this could be a lot of takeaways
for folks that are listening in that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll be able to apply in their own
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited for this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into it,
can you give us an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm Michael Grahams and I started
growing about almost a year and a half ago
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really because I just wanted to
grow my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really know what's going on out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know what everybody's putting
into their stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm starting to get real weary on
what's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really wanted to take full control of
what's going into my garden, what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: into my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what is your style of growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you an indoor grower, outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said you grow both with organic
inputs as well as synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What medium are you in as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right now I've only been able to
have the chance to grow indoor and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: growing both, like you said, organic and
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for my organic grow, I'm using Build a
Soil 3.0 and I try to run their whole
[SPEAKER_01]: line, all Build a Soil, the whole Build a
Soil family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my synthetic grow, I haven't stuck
to one cocoa yet, but I've been switching
[SPEAKER_01]: around from different cocoa companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit of both soil and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to experience doing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people might be listening into
this and they might be not knowing fully
[SPEAKER_00]: what the difference is between organic and
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: With organics, the way I grow,
I try to get everything set before I even
[SPEAKER_01]: plant my first seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to have all my nutrients,
everything that's going to be taken up
[SPEAKER_01]: within the grow already set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in synthetic, it's an inert media,
the cocoa that I use, there's nothing in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and I'm adding my nutrients as I go
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeding nutrients every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll break down your feeding regimen
here in a few minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are quite a few differences
between organic and synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think organic, a lot of people think of
all natural things that come from the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainability is something that can be
mentioned when it comes to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the differences in techniques,
we're going to get into that now as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, medium, container size that you
can use, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into medium first.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're growing organically,
what medium do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you mentioned soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's in that mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's already a pre-made mix from
Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come out with a pretty good bag,
3.0, and everything's already prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're ready to go to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you're ready to go to flower,
maybe a few weeks before, you'll add your
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that you're going to need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm adding Kraft Blend, I'm adding
Kashi, I'm adding Thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pulled up the 3.0 recipe here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got so much stuff in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much to name off everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish compost, we've got biodynamic
compost, worm castings, trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_00]: the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very long list of things that
included in this recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of people have really
good success with Build a Soil soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a handful of them,
but I think their most popular one is that
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.0 recipe that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since I started using it,
I've been sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had a problem with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can stick a fresh cut directly in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with organic, another thing that is
worth mentioning is you're really relying
[SPEAKER_00]: on the microbe life in order to break down
those amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all the amendments in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some can be soluble, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you water it in, it turns into a
bioavailable form that the plant can then
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, a lot of these are
going to need that after the watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes go to work then, and they
break down those nutrients and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into a form that's going to be available
for the plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we didn't mention before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're growing with the
synthetic bottled nutrients, are you just
[SPEAKER_00]: in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm in a 70-30 cocoa perlite mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no amendments that you add in
prior to planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just using the bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I actually got a salt nutrients,
so no bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all dry nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powdered form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what container size are you using
when growing organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: When I grow my organics, I go anywhere
from five to seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't mind growing a little bit
bigger, but right now, that's all I'm able
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as my synthetic grow, when I grow
my synthetics, it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen I could grow in a one-gallon pot
or in a five-gallon pot, and I could still
[SPEAKER_01]: get the same results depending on how much
I'm feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the organic side of things,
you often hear people say the bigger,
[SPEAKER_00]: the better.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly get away with smaller
grow pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what's small is certainly
subjective, but I think a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_00]: would consider three-gallons, five-gallons
as being smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even maybe some people might say
seven-gallons or 10-gallons are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prefer 15-gallons or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally ran organics in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried three-gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried five-gallons, seven-gallons,
up to 10-gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually gotten easier and easier
as I've moved up in pot size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the biggest argument for
folks that are growing organically is they
[SPEAKER_00]: say the bigger the pot size, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's certainly there are downsides
to running a bigger pot size, but having
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a bigger pot size and having more
nutrition in there, it just can be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier, kind of retaining moisture and so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the synthetic, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like right now I've got two-gallon grow
pots that I'm growing with the synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the smaller side of things,
and I've also run that with three-gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: five-gallons, seven-gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've tried out a variety of things as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do like growing in those
smaller ones, particularly two-gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're hand-watering, there might
be an advantage there to being one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger pot sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to water as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on an auto-watering system,
like I'm on the Blue Mat system with
[SPEAKER_00]: two-gallon containers, it's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those Blue Mat systems are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually need to give me one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still hand-watering myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I got a couple of self-watering
bases, but I need more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it can be so much easier to just
dump water into a reservoir, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have your organic inputs in
there, and it's just slowly dripping down
[SPEAKER_00]: as needed onto the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for feedings, I want to get deep into
this one because this is, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: is where a lot of people get tripped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: For organics, you had mentioned that
you're using the Build Solar 3.0 recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really going to need any
additional nutrition to begin,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what pot size you're using,
how big of a plant you're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: how long you veg for, you could
potentially run out of that nutrition that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be depleted from the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that the case for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, what organic inputs are you
providing the plant with?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as in veg, I haven't had a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my plant, I'll go through the whole veg
cycle fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when you're flipping into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a lot of people see the organic,
they see the bags, and they hear water
[SPEAKER_01]: only.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll get you so far water only,
but it's not going to get you the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want if you're only using water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I go into flour, I'm adding a
craft blend, and I'm adding a
[SPEAKER_01]: build-a-flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to help me get all the
nutrients that I need later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in organic, it's going to take a
while for everything to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to prepare your soil before
you get into flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're top dressing before flipping the
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you usually doing a veg for?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done one month veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done two month veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice with the two month veg,
I'll get a bigger yield at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30 to 60 days, and then before flipping
the flour, you'll top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you just do that one top dressing
before flipping the flour, or are you also
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a top dressing kind of mid-flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes mid-flour too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add some stash, and I'll hit it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know roughly people do every 30
days, but it really depends on,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, what size container you're in,
how big the plants are, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I feel like in those five gallon
pots, just that one time in the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: before I flipped the flour, it's enough.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's been doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had no deficiencies towards the
end, and I'm happy with what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then build a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other inputs you use on the
organic side of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will there be worm castings or any
additives or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's worm castings in the craft
blend leaf, but I'm also using a Bokashi,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's another bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also comes from the Build a Solar
Family.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's a Yahweh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thrive bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's being applied at the same time
as the build a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, pretty easy regimen there when it
comes to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, I think that's one thing
that a lot of people like is you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing a few, two, maybe three,
sometimes maybe even more top dressings,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's just water only from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely makes things a lot
easier when it comes to feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the synthetic bottled nutrients
side, that powdered line that you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, what is the name of the line that
you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Thrive Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: A pretty simple line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two-part system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the A and B, from veg to flower,
it's the same ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't really have to worry about
calculations or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real simple line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing a full dose according to
their feeding chart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing like a half dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how often are you doing feedings?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm filling up a five gallon reservoir,
and that probably lasts with me about
[SPEAKER_01]: three to four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got about four plants growing off of
that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just scooping it out with
a container and then watering your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: as needed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I got a water hose now and it's a
lot easier so I can just water my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within two minutes, everything's done and
it's real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you doing, I think you mentioned
in the beginning, you're feeding every
[SPEAKER_00]: single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime the medium dries out,
you're giving a dose of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever done the every other feeding
where you're watering one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you're feeding the next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when the medium dries out your water,
you're again going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a very common technique when
it comes to using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done that before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just a straight nutrient mix
every single time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with my synthetic, I haven't done
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been given the nutrients every
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you run into any toxicity issues at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I haven't had no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a really easy lineup to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I really like it ever since I
started using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I'm going to switch over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I like using other lines too,
like trying different stuff, but I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really set with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to adjust the pH at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common thing that people look at
when using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll mix it up in their nutrient
solution and then they'll adjust to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does your pH come out to before and
then what do you adjust it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I adjust it, it's usually around
6.8 or 7 and I try to get that down to 6,
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.8, 6, around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.8 or 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use to adjust down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the GEH, general hydroponics pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe that's a phosphoric acid,
but I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those acids are very commonly
used in order to adjust the pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the organics, are you pHing at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are you monitoring the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I can, but the plants have been
showing me that she's doing good and she's
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think I need to change anything
on that side right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way that it makes things
easier is you don't have to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in your particular case,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about water here in a minute,
but your initial water source is certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tell you whether or not you need
to do that pH adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people comes out of their tap at 8 pH
or higher and they're like, I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the pH or else I come across
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're tap water or your filter or
whatever water source you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it falls within that 6 to 7 range
roughly, sometimes it can be up to 7.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: People swear that they add that in and
they don't do any sort of pH adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: and their plants are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when I check mine out the tap,
it's at 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still like, I let my reservoirs
aerate overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick a air stone in the water,
let that sit for at least 24 hours before
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it to any of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also said to help eliminate some of
that chlorine that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that extra stuff that you don't want
to give, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your local water source,
it uses either chlorine or chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if chloramines included,
that's one thing that people really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be aware of is that isn't something
that is just going to, if you have it sit
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight, it disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a stable molecule versus the
chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just let it sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people let it sit and have an air
stone in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you do, some people put in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that helps with it dissipating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my first six months when I started
growing, I was buying water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just buying distilled water every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was getting expensive after a
while, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started testing with my tap water and
the plants didn't really give me too much
[SPEAKER_01]: of a reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything on was the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just stuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy live locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was buying water every time he was
buying reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think over time, it's going
to be worth it to buy a system that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually install underneath your
kitchen sink, for example, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these are now a one-to-one
ratio before a lot of the old systems are
[SPEAKER_00]: a one-to-three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically for every one gallon of RO
water that you get out of the system
[SPEAKER_00]: there, three gallons would be wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I mentioned, it's a one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every one gallon you get,
only one gallon is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, buying that, which is 200,
250 bucks roughly for that particular
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the one-to-one system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can certainly save you money over the
long run versus going and buying either
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse osmosis or distilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very, very costly doing that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely looking into getting
something different and picking up a
[SPEAKER_01]: system for the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to worry about a lot of it
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about the EC or PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any type of monitoring of
the EC or PPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on either one of them, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I monitor is the pH on my
synthetic side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to check the PPM or the
PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to focus on one number and
stick to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people play the numbers game and
they chase it and they're just driving
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But until I see something going on with my
clients where I feel like I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something wrong or I'm lacking in
something, then I'll start paying a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people take the same
route that you do when it comes to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things in particular, where they
are mostly hands-off when it comes to both
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, like we mentioned, as well as the EC
and the PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're coming across problems,
some people do check that, both the pH and
[SPEAKER_00]: EC or PPM in order to see, hey,
is there a lack of nutrition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is there too much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's too much nutrition in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's caused a toxicity issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking on an as needed basis seems to be
the theme for a lot of folks growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you had mentioned that with synthetic,
that synthetic line using the powdered
[SPEAKER_00]: line, you're not checking the EC or PPM of
that, which I think a lot of people might
[SPEAKER_00]: say that's a little surprising there not
to monitor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across any issues like with
toxicities in particular or any
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since I started using this line,
I swear I haven't had no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to check out that line,
maybe even try it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a real easy line to use,
especially if you're using it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not having to check EC or the PPM
because that's a common thing that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people do though, to make sure that the
nutrient solution going into it is the
[SPEAKER_00]: range they're looking for or they'll check
the runoff measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll run the nutrient solution
through and then they'll check the runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that the EC or PPM is kind
of within certain ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not aiming for particular ranges
for the different stages of growth when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing with the synthetic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just monitoring the pH levels and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I really recommend that line for
anybody who's new and thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been real good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a new grower, I haven't had no
problems and yeah, I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you already mentioned using tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how do you go about the waterings of
your plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kind of checking the medium and
seeing if it's dry or are you kind of on a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll start with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about watering when you're
using the organic inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I used to have it on a self-watering
base.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would just drink as they wanted to
and I would let that dry out maybe once a
[SPEAKER_01]: week and then I would top dress the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I top dressed to the feed
into the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The self-watering base will hold about
maybe three days of water, three days of
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I check the level on it,
I know this is getting dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start checking the weight of the actual
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pick up the actual pot,
see how heavy it's getting or how light
[SPEAKER_01]: it's getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been the easiest way for me to
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when growing organics, you have only
been using the self-watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about when you're growing with
the synthetic inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still doing a self-watering or are
you top-watering or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm top-watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day I'm top-watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you're in cocoa, more of an area
medium doesn't hold onto the moisture as
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing every single day you're going
in there and doing a watering,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to use a self-watering basis,
but I've heard people have problems when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're feeding synthetic vinyl feedings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want to experience them
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to keep doing what's
been working for me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just top-watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not broke, don't fix it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fun to experiment,
but as long as you're just experimenting
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe on something small, not your
actual garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty straightforward there,
how you go about your waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into pests next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with IPM, things you could do
to prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do in that case?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had problems with pests and I had a
bad bag of cocoa in the past that I had to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with fungus nets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get rid of that, I had to use
mosquito bits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that I had to water into
the cocoa every day for at least about a
[SPEAKER_01]: week till I got rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I normally keep sticky traps around
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's always a good monitor just to
keep an eye on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to stop you from getting
them, but it's going to tell you if you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a problem or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: F**king stats are such a pain,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I battle them so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to come and go so often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be certainly be frustrating when
you have a crazy outbreak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't sound like they have been too
crazy for you though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across any major pest
infestations, whether it be spider mice,
[SPEAKER_00]: thrips, anything like that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nah, just the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, that's all I had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know, they say you're not a
real bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider mites and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'm not a real bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I heard somebody say that at the
grow shop the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, I guess I'm not a real
bro yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess agree to disagree on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who have been growing for
five plus years and they've never come
[SPEAKER_00]: across pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to call them not a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear that you haven't come
across any major infestations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be such a pain, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had aphids outdoors one time and it was
so disheartening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was on actually my bok choy and I went
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was harvest day and I was like,
ah, going to harvest some bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first time growing it, I was super
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was purple lady bok choy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like completely purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to go harvest it and I'm
just, you just loaded with aphids kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like borrowed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just, uh, it was disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh no, how the heck am I going
to eat this stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things about growing
outside is like you can't really control
[SPEAKER_01]: too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on out there outdoors is a
whole different battlefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you doing anything as a preventative,
like a sprays, a lot of people use sprays,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly like in the veg stage in
order to kind of deter pests or prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: pests from coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do those at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't had so yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I know everybody, everybody's
telling me to go ahead and just get some
[SPEAKER_01]: preventative maintenance going on before
it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I haven't had the chance to experiment
with any different types of sprays yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm always wanting to try something.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep my fingers crossed that you
don't come across any infestation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hope for the best on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what climate are you in?
[SPEAKER_01]: The temperature range that I try to keep
is anywhere from 75 to 80, maybe about 60,
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% humidity level, maybe a little bit
higher in the beginning, but towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: end I'm dropping it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably the lowest I'll get is
about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 60% for the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I start off like in my veg stage,
I'm aiming for a higher humidity level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably around 70 to 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I'm going, flipping into my next
stage is when I'll start lowering it and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably towards the end of the flower,
I'm probably down to about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you supplementing CO2 at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get some type of system going,
but I haven't had like, chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment with that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed when I had my garden in my
bedroom, when it was still small,
[SPEAKER_01]: my garden was still small.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants were growing a lot faster and I
believe it was because of the CO2 that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to provide for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that it's in a separate room,
yeah, I see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people who work out in their
grow room in order to release that CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's temperature, humidity,
and CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about some mistakes that
growers make.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting with organics, are there any
mistakes that you made or mistakes that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know of that people make when growing
organically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, my first organic grow, I read the
bag and said the water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just watered only the whole way
through all the way to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I quickly realized that that wasn't
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's only so much that water is
going to get you, but in flower you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to need to add all the extra stuff
that you need and you're going to need all
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people run into that
problem because they see that on the bag
[SPEAKER_00]: water only and they think they're good for
the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they come across problems and
then they give up on organics because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not happy with the result.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought it was water only and all of
a sudden they think it's something else
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're doing in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think a lot of people fall
into that same trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about when growing with synthetic
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any mistakes that you can think
of that maybe you've come across?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only mistakes I had so far was my pH
pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't have the proper pH pen and it
wasn't training right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started feeding my nutrients,
I wasn't getting the growth I was
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I finally got a new pH pen and I
seen that my old pH pen was way off and I
[SPEAKER_01]: was able to adjust everything and get
everything correct right away,
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed the difference like the very
next two days, the times were taking off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's happened to me before as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, those probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the pH pen, I wish they lasted a lot
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can use storage solution,
which is recommended, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're not keeping that probe
in storage solution at all times,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, when you're not using the pen,
it can dry out and it dries out so
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you come across inaccuracies and
you have to actually buy a new probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these meters, they don't have
replaceable probes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to buy a whole new meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I learned my lesson a long time ago
about keeping it in storage solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully, it lasts a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you still need to calibrate too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I typically calibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some really good meters that I've
gotten away with not calibrating several
[SPEAKER_00]: months without calibrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been still accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think general recommendation is
every month or so to calibrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, that's a question I'd like
to pass off to the audience, the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are listening in for the folks that
use a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you calibrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, pH pen, man, that is something
that can definitely be thrown off over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you definitely need to keep your eyes
on that because that could cause problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend getting the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of cheaper versions
that are available, but I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an AC Infinity one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got the all-in-one AC Infinity
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using that since it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving on, one thing I want to ask you
about, I like to ask this every now and
[SPEAKER_00]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Advice for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the folks that are just getting
started growing with organic inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: what advice do you have for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to be listening to other
growers and taking advice from other
[SPEAKER_01]: growers, try to stick with one grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go from one grower and take advice
from another grower and another grower and
[SPEAKER_01]: get tips from another grower because it's
going to mix everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to find somebody that you could use as
a mentor, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stick with their grow style so you
could develop your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do mix things when they shouldn't
mix, particularly like amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll kind of try to play soil scientist
and like, oh, I heard from this guy that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is good to add in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this guy is this good to add in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden there's an imbalance
of nutrition in the medium and some
[SPEAKER_00]: elements are locking out others,
preventing uptake from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're coming across problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of like stick to somebody's
regiment that you're following.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just go with what they're going to
begin until you've kind of seen some
[SPEAKER_00]: success there, then kind of experimenting
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you're mixing all these
different things, you can certainly come
[SPEAKER_00]: across problems and some could be hard to
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, with organics and so it's a lot
harder to correct because it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: take time for the stuff to break down or,
you know, it's not going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you do is not going to be readily
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not going to see if you
corrected it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any specific tips for growing
synthetically that you'd like to give to
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, don't get stuck to one line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe don't be afraid to try new lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a whole bunch of
different nutrient companies out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of them are doing the same
thing, just put different labels on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't think just because one brand is
more popular or more expensive,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to try new things,
but just always make sure you got your pH
[SPEAKER_01]: levels right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question I'd like to ask towards
the end of the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you list off top three strains that
you've grown and kind of what you like
[SPEAKER_00]: about them?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was just recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Chad Westport snow joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a real easy grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: She grew out nice and frosty, super
frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: She purple out real nice at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I harvested, you know,
she was real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: She became a real good, real good,
uh, real good effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've only gotten about a year growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So only so much that I got growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of my other favorite ones that I
had was, uh, back to the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you ever had the chance to
try that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it was a real good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No taste buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a UK, I believe, but that one too,
she was a real big yielder, real fat,
[SPEAKER_01]: long colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you open your tent, you, you're going
to like what you see, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: she's going to give you what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to give you a nice,
good song, nice, good effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good narcotic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have one more for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trap cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you ever had try that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She comes out real purple, super purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual nuts are purple, not just the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's real frosty.
[SPEAKER_01]: She smells real good, like a real strong,
strong fruit punch with a hit of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of funk in the backend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely one that I plan on
keeping around for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, that sounds right up my alley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's the breeder on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that was exotic or relentless.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the two I had to double check and
I'll get back with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this has been awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've went through quite a few things when
it comes to how to grow organically and
[SPEAKER_00]: then how to grow with synthetic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of really how you do things in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what this podcast is all
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people from all different
experience levels, beginners,
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate, advanced, and they're really
just talking about either kind of area
[SPEAKER_00]: that they specialize in or how they do
things within their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really happy that you sat down with me
today and talked about how you do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely think there's some good
takeaways here, particularly for the folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just getting started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, man, we'll wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I appreciate you having me on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can find me on YouTube,
MachoGramsGramsBeSavage and Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: same name, MachoGramsGramsBeSavage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just look out for videos coming out on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I'll be focusing on more
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know some content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll definitely have a link to
Macho's YouTube channel down in the
