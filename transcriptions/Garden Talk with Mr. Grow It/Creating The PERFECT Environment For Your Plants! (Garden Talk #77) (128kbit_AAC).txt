[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing are Wi-Fi switches.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little Wi-Fi switches change the
game for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can put schedules on there,
feeding schedules, you can turn pumps on
[SPEAKER_01]: and off, you can turn lights on and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main goal is to get the leaf
temperature at a certain temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically in veg, I want my leaf
temperature to be at 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll adjust the ambient temperature
to what matches the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're humans, we forget no matter what,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime you can put a machine in there
doing something, it's just one less thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four week veg was kind of my norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like two weeks and it's already
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they just grow so much faster,
so much stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Dula the
Rula.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for about 16 years
and works with various commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation facilities in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about creating
the perfect environment for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com Before we get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I want to acknowledge that one of my
goals for this podcast is to bring zero
[SPEAKER_00]: cost for information about gardening all
plants to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Vivo Sun for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivo Sun has been one of the top
manufacturers of horticulture equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of you have seen in my grow
videos, I have grown successfully using
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow tents, their inline fans,
LED grow lights, HID grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and numerous accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivo Sun continues to create really
interesting technology that makes home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their website at vivosun.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will provide a link in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Gorilla Grow Tent for
sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different sized clone tents,
18 inches and 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 18 inch clone tent is designed to fit
standard size seedling trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 24 inch tent, which is the one that
they sent me, is designed to fit the Super
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloner 50 or two standard size seedling
trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a clone tent fan and
filter, which is designed to fit perfectly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the rooftop micro mesh compartment of
both the 18 inch and 24 inch tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their website at grow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: AEC Infinity is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their clip-on oscillating fan is now
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their 6 inch version for
over 6 months now, and I absolutely love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to clip on the side of my grow
tent, and it has 10 different speeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it easy to control air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also have non-oscillating versions
of these clip-on fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fans are currently in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they sell out of the fans,
which I expect them to often, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-order them for the next release.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Dula the Rula.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking for the past little
over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we were supposed to have you on
over a year ago, and now we're finally
[SPEAKER_00]: getting you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to be talking all about
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about creating the perfect
environment for your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easier said than done,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, particularly growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we're going to focus on
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have control of the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, before we get deep into
environment, introduction, can you tell us
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit about yourself and how you
got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been growing kind of on and off
for about 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got really into it when I was young.
[SPEAKER_01]: My folks actually used to have a garden in
the backyard and they used to grow just
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of vegetables and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one time my grandpa, I saw him take a
branch from a fig tree and literally
[SPEAKER_01]: splice it into this pear tree with some
tape and it just kind of blew my mind and
[SPEAKER_01]: it just kind of fascinated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I got introduced to medical
plants, I got really into it and started
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out how it does what it
does and why it does what it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to just really dive into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at a really young age, when I was
about 17, I built like a deep water
[SPEAKER_01]: culture system and I was just growing with
hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea what I was doing,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it was before YouTube,
before Mr. Grow It, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I learned a lot about what not to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, that was sometimes that's
better than learning what to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I studied architecture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an engineering background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I'm able to think of it,
to approach it in an engineering
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really into building the right
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have two different type of plants
or the same type of plant in two different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments and they'll grow completely
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I went to Dubai about 12
years ago or say, so I kind of stopped
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when things started becoming legal,
I got back into it and started researching
[SPEAKER_01]: and I fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt ready to go and came out here to
good old Oklahoma to get in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was about almost two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, I've been designing grow
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working as a consultant in farms
and big indoor facilities as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just really now I'm getting into
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing a lot of packaging stuff,
stickers, and things like that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and that's kind of, you know,
what I've been doing in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first connected before we started
recording, you had mentioned that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been gardening for 16 years off and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got quite a bit of experience
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that you've actually worked
all your way up into working with
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities and doing the
environment for those facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people that are better than you
to talk about this, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with their engineering
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it goes hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't think when I was, you know,
getting my degree that I'd be using it
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been, you know, really helpful,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get too deep, what's your
style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to ask this kind of before we get
deep into the topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you indoors, mostly
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're typically in your organic grower,
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't really have a style per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still kind of trying to figure that
out still.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still R&D-ing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still so much more to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't really, I guess,
have a style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in cocoa mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that would kind of be it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the farm, we're doing living soil beds
as well as using Athena soil beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to pretty much learn as much
as I can about everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing auto flower outdoors now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the first time I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to see how that
comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor, for sure, is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for all kinds of reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And greenhouses are just insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the, and being out here,
in Oklahoma with the weather, it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: bipolar.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day it's hot, one day it's cold,
one day it's humid, one day it's like no
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just trying to keep up with
the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, but I started with deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've been doing since I was
young.
[SPEAKER_01]: I loved just hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just made a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with commercial size facilities
and stuff like that, I think cocoa is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm getting into rockwool now with
just rockwool cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely tried out a big handful
of things in there and you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: experience doing several different ways,
which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Describe your grow room setup,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you walk into your grow room,
maybe how big is the grow room?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants you're running?
[SPEAKER_00]: Name off some of the equipment you run,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my home grow, I got a 20 by 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running six mature plants and six
immature plants that I stress train a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it completely different than I would
in a commercial grow in the sense that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: just topping and femming and doing all
these things that I would normally do per
[SPEAKER_01]: se as much of in a commercial setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just trying to maximize the yield
and more colas and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do everything, drip system with cocoa,
let it run down a table that's about 10
[SPEAKER_01]: feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it drains out into a gutter that goes
into a condensation pump that kicks it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it because it's so easy to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stays consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got AC ducts coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got three of them coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think grow LEDs are the lights that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have really good DLI control with the
troll master.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using a floor flex drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even have a DI tank and an RO tank as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm using RO water and I'm running
Athena.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started using Athena and it was just,
it just makes things so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm trying to juggle so many
things at once, it's easy to just come in
[SPEAKER_01]: and just mix it up real quick and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two 55 gallon drums.
[SPEAKER_01]: One collects the RO and then I have a
mixed tank also that has a pump that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have like a timer on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the timer kicks it on and feeds
about four or five times a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I got some fans for circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is like the number one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no number one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even like saying that's the number
one thing because they're all like equally
[SPEAKER_01]: as important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about grow room monitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use as like a monitor to
monitor like your temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, VPD, CO2, all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use, for CO2, I have an autopilot
controller regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that it works great with a Titan
regulator on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For my lights and stuff like that,
I have troll master.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the irrigation, I have also a troll
master, the AquaX controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have ink birds that turn the
humidifiers on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little dehu in there that's
pretty much constantly running.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm constantly dehumidifying and
humidifying kind of at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, it stays pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have, I use like sensor push,
little sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing are Wi-Fi switches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this thing, these little Wi-Fi
switches change the game for me because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put schedules on there,
feeding schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn pumps on and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can turn lights on and off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm basically able to control it from
anywhere, just on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can fill up the tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I can't do is just mix the
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, all I have to do is mix the
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not, I don't have to make it
that easy, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that's all the
controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pulses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use a troll master also for my,
the PAR meter that's constantly connected
[SPEAKER_01]: to the troll master.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have also a moisture meter in the
cocoa that gives me my moisture content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and that's about, I think that's
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting down to the nitty gritty of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for,
for temperature and how do you control the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with temperature, depending on whether
I'm using HPS's or LEDs, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's in HPS, I do it about in veg
of about, you know, 82 to 85.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main goal is to get the leaf
temperature at a certain, at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically in veg, I want my leaf
temperature to be at 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll adjust the ambient temperature
to what matches the leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's kind of what I'm going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in veg, I want the leaf temperature
to be around 83 and flower around 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with LEDs, I run the rooms really
hot to get that leaf temperature at 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: With HPS's you don't have to do it as much
cause HPS's have that, have that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with LEDs, I run the rooms at like
88, 89.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's, it's pretty hot,
but because I also have CO2 in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're able to take it like, like it's
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually, you know, love it like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was all about VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until LEDs came around and that kind of,
you know, changed things up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, I always try to get the right,
you know, VPD, but with, with the room
[SPEAKER_01]: being so hot, you would have to turn the
humidity above 80 sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like to go above 80% humidity
ever just because, you know, mold can
[SPEAKER_01]: start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, in humidities like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always keep, keep the humidity low.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's, that's usually how it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really use, I don't usually like,
you know, flower with it freezing cold or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything until the very end, I'll drop it
down to maybe 72.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, those are the temps
I usually like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your temperature, you said you
were in a real high temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to run cooling at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing like a standalone AC or are
you doing a central AC in your home or
[SPEAKER_00]: like, what are you doing for cooling?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have central AC that I like,
I actually, I went up in the attic and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and ducted some ACs just straight from the
ceiling into the, into the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's been working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, pretty great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how I'm feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the house as long as, as long as
they're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how I'm cooling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fan that will kick on and,
and blow air just into the tent and let
[SPEAKER_01]: some hot air go out from the, from the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how I, how I exhaust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to do that too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to keep the CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's all kinds of,
you know, ifs and thens and buts that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, change things around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever get to a point like sometimes
in the winter time, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I live, it gets cold and I need to
actually add a heat even with the grill
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a small heater, those space
heaters, the tower type heaters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you utilize heat at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need to or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's always fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always fighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat, you know, now that I've been
running my rooms pretty hot, the lights
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to be sufficient enough to provide
all that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get, they get pretty hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those think rows in, in a small tent,
you know, but basically just to control
[SPEAKER_01]: it, I would, you know, put the lights down
and, and just turn the power down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the same PPFs, but just use
less power and less heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to control the heat, just dim the
lights, bring it closer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you still getting the same amount of
photons at the canopy, but you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: generating as much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely, definitely helps,
especially if you have heat problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing I'm doing, which,
um, not many people are doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some people are calling me crazy,
but, um, I have like this DLI control and
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it set also to when it goes to a
certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that it, like the power goes,
it, it shoots a lot of photons at like
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000 PPFs and then goes back down to zero
and then back to 5,000 and back to zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of acts like, kind of like
clouds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're outside in the sun and you
have a par meter, it's never just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a solid number.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to be going up and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have that going on and I average
out to about 1200, sometimes 1400 PPFs in
[SPEAKER_01]: a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's what I'm shooting for is,
is that DLI, that daily light integral is
[SPEAKER_01]: how much photons they collect throughout
that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it doesn't matter how,
how they're getting those photons as long
[SPEAKER_01]: as they're not getting too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been working great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like it because some, you know,
when it shoots at a higher PPF,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll get some of the lower, uh,
you know, butt spots and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's kind of been working pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave the red light on the whole time,
like during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you'll see is the lights,
uh, going from white to red, white to red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's temperature and that's how you
do the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched upon humidity a little bit,
and I'd like to get a little bit deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you're running a
dehumidifier and that you're also running
[SPEAKER_00]: a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're both kind of running and
balancing out as they need to on your
[SPEAKER_00]: InBird controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What brands are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of audience would want to
know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get the question all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What dehumidifiers are good?
[SPEAKER_00]: What humidifiers are good?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what brands are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, are you aiming for
different humidities throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I have a little, um, like a clone
tent that's like two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, a clone start there, I have a
humidifier in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that's just like at a
hundred percent when I start and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: drop it down to about 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they go into veg, it's around,
it's around 80, uh, the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I'm in flower, I drop it
down to about 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's kind of been, you know,
my, my sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's, uh, it just kind of,
it just kind of stays there at that 65
[SPEAKER_01]: range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now this is just like this tent,
this tent setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, whenever we're talking about
greenhouse or outdoor or anything like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, yeah, there's not much you can do,
but with, with something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not trying to fight the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to kind of work with what you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's really, really hot,
you know, turn up the humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that VPD, uh, you know, gets in that,
that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've been saying VPD a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're probably going to talk about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I might as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about VPD directly related
to temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I do have a lot of beginners
watching this cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you explain what is VPD?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you aim to keep your environment
within that optimal VPD range?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So VPD is vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically it's the difference between
the moisture in the air and the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the, the closer you are to that
sweet VPD range that you would see on a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, on a VPD chart, um, the better the
plants are at transpiring and at breathing
[SPEAKER_01]: and taking up CO2 and being able to
release that humidity at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whenever your VPD is off, then,
uh, you know, your stomata that breathe in
[SPEAKER_01]: the CO2 and take it up, like stay kind of
closed and it's hard for them to breathe
[SPEAKER_01]: it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it causes a lot of different issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the closer you are to keeping that
VPD in the sweet range, uh, the better the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are at, you know, uptaking
nutrients, uptake, uh, breathing and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and exhaling and producing oxygen and
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that VPD is, is, is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I focused a lot more on that in,
in greenhouse settings, uh, and in big
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors that have HPSs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with LEDs, I'm still, you know,
it's not the same as, as HPSs because if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running the rooms really hot,
I'd have to make the VPD in the nineties,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the humidity, I mean,
and that kind of doesn't make sense to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with LEDs, uh, it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the reason, the reason it's
different with LEDs when the heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, if you're thinking about like,
let's say it's cold outside, but the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: is still out, you know, that sun is still
blasting heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it hits your skin, you still feel
it burn your skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of the same way with,
with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if the ambient temperature is,
is, is low and that sun is out,
[SPEAKER_01]: those leaves are still getting hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with LEDs, we try to, we try to get
that same feeling, you know, so we want
[SPEAKER_01]: them to have that same feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we run the rooms really hot
and the leaves get really hot and they
[SPEAKER_01]: think that the sun is hitting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all that, all, all those are
connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, the best thing to do is
to have everything balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually do chase after VPD myself and,
uh, I live in a very dry climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm always adding humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even have a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used the LeVault smart humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have like three of them top
fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smart one where it hooks up to your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get alerts when the humidifier is
out, when it needs to be cleaned,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love that humidifier first off,
but I'm always adding in humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as I'm adding in humidity,
staying within that VPD range,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really becomes somewhat easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know different climates,
the difficulty level is going to vary,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, for me, I kind of, I guess,
lucked out a little bit being living in
[SPEAKER_00]: the climate I live in now, cause adding in
the humidity, I'm able to have a high temp
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all I really need to do is just add in
some cooling, increase the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it usually falls in with that VPD
range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, VPD is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I personally chase after.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people chase after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, just to clarify, when you look at
those VPD, charts, there is a dark green
[SPEAKER_00]: section, which is the optimal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a light green section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's what the yellow section
or some of the charts that it's like red
[SPEAKER_00]: to where it's really out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not optimal at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the plants struggling at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in that light green range,
you're still okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people aim to be in
that optimal range, which is very narrow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, your plant will still be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of people panic that
they're not in that dark green range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, wait, take a step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be all right, even when
you're in that light green range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd mention that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I get OCD about things and like,
I want them to be like perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want those numbers that I'm looking
forward to be there, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I'll keep going until,
until I figure I'll add stuff and take
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff away until it becomes closest that I
can get it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't be happy until, until it is,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it's, it's, uh, it's super
important, uh, in plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly, like, I think if your VPD is
off completely the whole time,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, well, first of all, it'll never be
as good as it can be, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to, it's hard to,
it's hard to grow like that and think like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, when you know,
it can be better and just not do something
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, you know, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some people out there, they just want
to get a harvest, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, they, maybe they don't have
money for a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have money for a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just roll with the punches as best
as they can, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the overall final quality might not be
as good as if you were in the VPD range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good example is me living in a very dry
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through growth where the
humidity has been 20%, 30%, which is way
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have a, when it's very dry
like that, it increases transpiration in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, in the high heat,
it's more prone to foxtailing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just had like very airy buds,
foxtail buds from running of low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found when I do increase that
humidity and stay within the VPD range,
[SPEAKER_00]: bud quality is more dense, better bag
appeal during late flower, you can drop
[SPEAKER_00]: the temps, bring out some colors,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's definitely, um,
you know, we can continue to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD on and on the importance of it,
but it does stand true of staying within
[SPEAKER_00]: those, that VPD range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do get better quality and higher
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's very, it's very important
for sure, because if your plants aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiring properly, you're just going to
get some random issues and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to know, you know, you can't really
do much about it unless you fix,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and so, yeah, I mean, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got lucky because it's way easier to
add humidity than it is to take out
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so that's a lot, that's a lot
nicer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use like an ideal air humidifier,
which are insanely expensive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, they're great, but,
but $300, $400 for, you know, humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of crazy, but, and the way I
have it connected is I have a stealth RO
[SPEAKER_01]: system, one that's like about 150 gallons,
I think, per hour or per day, actually 150
[SPEAKER_01]: per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's, that's hooked up and it
splits off into my RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's constantly filling up my RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also hooked into all my
humidifiers and it's constantly filling
[SPEAKER_01]: those up and all the humidifiers have,
uh, float valves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they just shut off when they get
full and I never have to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pour water into humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, you know, is a game changer as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, uh, yeah, if you, if you have low
humidity, you're just going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just filling up water all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one thing that, uh,
I mean, you can hook up just a water hose
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, pretty much a water line and it'll
clean the water and fill everything up at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm filling up my humidifier once a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I think it's like a gallon and a
half capacity, so it's larger than,
[SPEAKER_00]: than most of the humidifiers on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can put a float valve in there
and have it automatically fill,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to look into that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll save you so much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you forget to put water in
there, you know, we're humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: we forget no matter what, you know,
so anytime you can put a machine in there
[SPEAKER_01]: doing something, it's just one less thing
to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's move on to CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some experience with CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried things such as a TMB natural
canisters, which can get very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently I'm doing the mushroom bags,
the CO2 365 exhale bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are, you know, better value,
I guess you could say for, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: for implementing CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't yet run the tanks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have a lot more experience
when it comes to CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got to ask, what do you typically
aim for when it comes to CO2 and how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you control the CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use a, uh, a tank, like a normal,
uh, like a 50 pound tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I have a Titan regulator on it and
I have a, you know, the tube going into
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent where there's a fan and I have
that regulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have the sensor I put on the
other end of the, uh, uh, of the tent on
[SPEAKER_01]: the, on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have the, I have it coming in
from the top and I have the air
[SPEAKER_01]: circulating forward and then it goes back
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes back up like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my goal is to get that CO2 to go and
come back and go on up underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants where they can breathe under,
under their leaves and the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, uh, that sensor in that regulator,
I mean, it just does it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like during veg, I'll aim it
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep it around like, like my,
my lights actually, like when I'm at like
[SPEAKER_01]: 900 PPFs and veg, my, my CO2 is usually
around 900 also.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go up to 1200, uh, with my PPFs,
my CO2, I bring that up to 1200.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, that's kind of how I've been
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, within, with CO2,
you know, naturally in the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's about, you know, 350 to 400 PPFs,
uh, PPMs of, uh, CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: We breathe out about 900.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Running it in at 1200 is like,
it's like giving them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what they breathe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just, they, they take it all in
and they just, it's like a superpower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like giving them, it's like Mario
eating a mushroom or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, it's like,
they just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do anything without CO2 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my life really right now is just
filling up CO2 every week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, uh, going back and forth to
the, to the grow store with tanks of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants grow so much more rapidly with
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are studies out there,
one in particular, which I heard from Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bruce Bugby from Utah city university
actually attended his certificate program
[SPEAKER_00]: that he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the studies he had mentioned is
that 1400 PPM of CO2 led to a 30% increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, all the other perimeter,
all the other variables like temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, all that stuff has to be dialed
in nutrition and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 30% increase in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's massive, massive, just from adding
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, a lot of people really rely
on CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's actually, it's crazy,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and I never used to do it back in
the day, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I used to veg for four weeks,
you know, four week veg was kind of my
[SPEAKER_01]: norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's like two weeks and it's already
too much, you know, I mean, they just grow
[SPEAKER_01]: so much faster, so much stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's, it's vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important, you know, it's just as
important as having a good light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but the thing is with CO2 now,
once you, once you raise your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, CO2 levels, you have to raise
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that everything stays balanced and you
keep that same ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your PPS need to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, your humidity and temperatures need to
go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your, your feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feed at 3.0 EC, um, when I'm,
when I'm using salt, when I'm using Athena
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, and they just take it like,
I mean, 3.0 EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have came up to me,
you know, years ago and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe feeding, you know, 1500 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do that from clone, like from clone,
they're getting fed 3.0 EC and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: being put pushed and pushed and that CO2
just lets them just take it in and produce
[SPEAKER_01]: so much sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The result you can get off that is just,
is crazy to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to add CO2 right now and the
greenhouse, but the thing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, we have, uh, an open roof
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a light depth and everything,
um, uh, automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I could raise the CO2 levels,
it'll just, it'll be a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's crazy because,
you know, it's open air and the CO2 will
[SPEAKER_01]: just leave and you know, you're crazy and
don't even try.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I could run, which is what
I'm about to start doing is running,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like a rain bird tube that has holes
in it and running the CO2 just through the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have like, uh, like a de
stratifying those fans that lift the air
[SPEAKER_01]: up and bring it back down in like this
motion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm going to add misters cause we
also have low, low humidity most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have misters at the top of CO2 here,
you know, and then CO2 weighs more than
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the CO2 will sink while the oxygen goes
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just going to see if that works or
not, you know, what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, you don't have to
always take people's words all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I think to do is to,
to try it yourself and, and fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you learn, you know,
I've, I've failed so many times and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: why I know the things that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what to look for because I've seen
it before from failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so we'll see what we'll see how
it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully that hopefully those misters
kind of that water kind of keeps,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the CO2 kind of low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hopefully I'm not just wasting CO2,
but the only way to do it is to just try
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what it does, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you don't know unless you try,
like you said, and, uh, I'm interested to
[SPEAKER_00]: see what you get for a result on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, adding CO2 in, you could do that,
but if you don't have proper air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get into next and your
plants not fully utilizing that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into air circulation indoors,
how many fans do you typically run in your
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what type of fans and where are the
fans positioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is always, always kind of
different, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of facilities, you know,
we'll have like, uh, let's say if it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 light facility and they have like a 20
ton AC unit, um, and it's, and it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, then the return air is, is coming in
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wherever the return air is coming in is
where I want to put the, the, the intakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the intakes will be at the top always.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the returns will be at the bottom so
that, uh, you know, the air that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: forward and then comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll place the fans to where it's,
it's pushing air in that direction and
[SPEAKER_01]: then have fans on the bottom and fans at
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't put fans on the side, uh,
because I just, like I said, I just try to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it going like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, exhausts will take the hot air out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and returns will keep the cold,
cool air coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air circulation is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to overdo it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the best thing to do is to have,
uh, like a measuring tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without measuring tools, you know,
so like if you say it's too windy,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's the speed?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, what is the speed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, you know, one foot per second,
five feet per second, like three to five
[SPEAKER_01]: is usually what I go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you want the, you want the leaves to
just wave instead of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, going in the wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think a lot of people overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of facilities I go to.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of, they put those rotating fans
and I do not like those rotating fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, especially on the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have airflow going like this and
then you have fans on this side and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't want stagnant air,
of course, but the only way to really tell
[SPEAKER_01]: is to get a wind, uh, like a wind meter
and just check every spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's a spot that's not getting
any air, that's where I'll put an extra
[SPEAKER_01]: fan and I'll just put one of those
hurricane fans that are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 inch ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I use all kinds of fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite ones are the de-stratifier
fans, the ones that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that have the, uh, the bowl at the top
that suck in air and then bring it back
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I think those are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those in indoor and in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, it's air circulation is
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you want to mimic what's going on
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you want you, there's a wind,
but you want like a cool breeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want a tornado, you know,
you don't want to get wind burn by
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing, you know, too much air on your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and yeah, three to five feet per
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind burn is a thing and you can
definitely do some damage to your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and stunt the growth of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have one of those 12 inch
hurricanes that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was growing in an open room,
the bedroom, I have a, I think it's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: nine by 12 room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was doing open room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that, I was utilizing that and I
actually had that in a grow tent before
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a little bit of an overkill when
it comes to the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I'm into my grow tents,
I actually have the AC infinity clip on
[SPEAKER_00]: fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a finally released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully I've run one up top and then
run on one of the bottom as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got air flow underneath the
plants, like through the bottom parts and
[SPEAKER_00]: then one above the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just a small sway right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the plants are dancing a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, and then ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the, we talked about air
exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into next at the AC
infinity cloud line T six and that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when, uh, you know, I haven't come on
intermittently as a temperature reaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually set it to 80, 82 at the most
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kick on, start exhausting some of
that hot air or if the humidity gets up to
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain set point, it'll start
exhausting some of that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the AC infinity inline fan
paired with the AC infinity clip on
[SPEAKER_00]: oscillating fans that has been working
wonders for me and in just micro tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for air exchange?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you exchanging the air at all,
or are you just not exchanging the air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you're adding CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super weird about air exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think of air exchange, I'm
thinking, okay, so I need some fresh air,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's like, you know, your plants
need fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants need fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it about that fresh air that the
plants need?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like what is it like,
okay, we're bringing in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing in CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants, they breathe out oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, there's plenty of oxygen,
you know, um, as far as CO2, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting in CO2, that's fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresh CO2, you know, they're breathing in
fresh CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in my mind, I'm like, why do I need
fresh air when I have fresh CO2 and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're breathing out oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing is if there's mold or
pathogens in the air, that's the only
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I could think of that would
make me want to clean the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have a carbon filter that,
that I put in there and that's just uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not connected to the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just circulates the air inside,
inside the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's in my mind, it's constantly
cleaning the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, I'm hoping that that's
what's happening, you know, cause I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to lose that CO2 and I don't need
fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I mean, there's fresh air man,
fresh CO2 and there's fresh oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what else I would need from
that fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of weird about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with air exchanges, I don't really,
I don't really try to do air exchanges
[SPEAKER_01]: unless I don't have CO2, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in like a greenhouse or something like
that, you'd want to put an air exchange so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you bring in fresh CO2 because they
actually breathe in that CO2 and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what's depleting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you need to add in there
when you want to bring in fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just what I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I could, I could be completely
wrong, but that's just how I see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so air circulation to me is more
important than air exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only exchange the air by taking it out
if it gets too hot, really, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, here's some fresh CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air scrubbing, I think is what people
refer to it as where you have like the
[SPEAKER_00]: inline fan and the carbon filter just in
the open room and you're scrubbing the air
[SPEAKER_00]: or cleaning the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what you were talking
about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we covered quite a bit when it comes to
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing I wanted to ask you is
logging or tracking the environment's
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people go old school and
they're using on a piece of paper while
[SPEAKER_00]: the people, they've got it on their phone
in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you tracking the environment's
condition, logging it in some way and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking back at the data and utilizing
it at all or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that in the commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have logs for everything
there and we collect that data so that
[SPEAKER_01]: when we do have a really great harvest and
even when we have a really bad harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can always go back and look and see
what our temps were, what our humidity is,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have something to adjust and work
off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping logs is really great when it
comes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at home, I don't really keep any logs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to keep it simple and it's
usually always the same temps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I were to keep a log, it would just
be the same thing over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, keeping logs is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to track how much water you're
using, what's your EC levels in the
[SPEAKER_01]: morning, what the pH is, and you got to
adjust obviously all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, keeping track.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like to do is I keep track of
timing schedules.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an Excel sheet where I can always
just go and see whatever day it is and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll tell me exactly what day and what
week I'm at and what I need to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: what IPMs are there, if I need to
defoliate or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll add stuff that I do that's
different instead of just logging in
[SPEAKER_01]: environment when it's at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I change feeding or if I change EC
levels or if I'm flushing or stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, I'll put a note on there so that on
my next run I can see, oh, around this
[SPEAKER_01]: time I did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to do that again?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, keeping logs, it helps you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's beneficial to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the funnest thing in the world,
but it's not the worst thing either.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the environment's conditions,
I use the sensor push monitor like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, you use in the beginning of
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have the Bluetooth monitor and I
also have the Wi-Fi gateway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to actually see it Wi-Fi
wherever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to look at the temperature,
humidity, and also VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can actually look back at this
historical data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see past hour, the past day,
the past week, the past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way I kind of have things
logged is just through my phone,
[SPEAKER_00]: just through that app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love that app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the sensor push.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't talk about it enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it for five, six years now
and it hasn't failed me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have sensor pushes everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have sensor pushes in greenhouses in
every corner and drying containers and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, bedrooms and literally everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one just in my house, just so I know
what's going on with my own environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, the historical data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can go back and see a lot of
times, a lot of times people miss what
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just as important as what's going
on during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't really care,
especially if their plants are doing okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people won't go back and look and
see what happened at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times, if it's way too humid
at night, then the plants can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: transpire as much because it gives it that
sticky feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's all wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't really release the moisture like
it wants to and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good to go back and look at the
data and see, you know, what's going on at
[SPEAKER_01]: night as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a great call out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So towards the end of the episode,
I'd like to ask a question specifically
[SPEAKER_00]: for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for those new to
gardening that struggle to keep their
[SPEAKER_00]: environments conditioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: In the ideal ranges, a lot of research,
a lot of watching videos, a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the most important thing is measuring
tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have measuring tools for
everything or else you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not we're not sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have ECs built into my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can't just look at something
and tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not we're not made like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have you have to have sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have measuring tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once you and then you can start
reading, watching videos, getting those
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters and then adding adding things
to get you to that parameter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know any like the specific
problems, but obviously, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's if it's hot, you want to add AC
and, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And but if you have a measuring tool and
you know what's going on, it's much easier
[SPEAKER_01]: to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you're just guessing, you know,
like some people will be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it's too hot in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come and check it and be like,
it needs to be even hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they think I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's too windy, how windy is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me, you know, or all the lights are
really bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's the PPFs, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so measuring tools for a beginner is
just as important as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: an expert or someone who's been doing it a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Measuring tools and research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever stop researching.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ever stop reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always trying to find new ways of
doing things in creative, weird ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if somebody hasn't done it,
that doesn't mean I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to try it and let you know if,
you know, if it worked or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, that's and never give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not going to it's not going to
be amazing in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you just get everything to
those parameters, it should just do its
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that's my advice is a
lot of people start and don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how to read the measurements and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say really get familiar with
with learning the measurements and
[SPEAKER_01]: learning you know, all the different,
you know, names for things or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what PPF is and how you measure
light and how you adjust it and what DLI
[SPEAKER_01]: is and all these things are so important
and will help no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram is Dula the Rula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a company called the Dubai Boys
also on Instagram where I do consulting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but mainly designs for grow facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do architectural drawings and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm designing a grow out in Cali right
now, a dispensary out in Louisiana that's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have some here and then I'm at
native provisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Instagram as well, native
provisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the farm I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 100 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have a greenhouse outdoor
aquaponics where we're raising fish,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and and that's a whole nother
thing right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on Instagram mainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a YouTube channel yet,
but you know, maybe we can get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to your
