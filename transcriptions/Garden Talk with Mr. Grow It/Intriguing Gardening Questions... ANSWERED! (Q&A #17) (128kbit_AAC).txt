[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: And today I've got a Q&A video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to clarify one thing real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last video I released on this
channel, I mentioned I'm taking a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for the Garden Talk podcast only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still upload videos to this
channel, such as these Q&A videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to ask me questions and
potentially get featured in one of these Q
[SPEAKER_00]: &A videos, follow me on Twitch,
twitch.tv slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure notifications are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way you'll be notified when I go live
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can come hang out and ask
some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is all I have for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into today's questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When reamending your soil, could you use
the water from your dehumidifier to
[SPEAKER_00]: moisten the soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I say thumbs up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm kind of going off of a study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one is by Quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me pull it up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quest dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What this is is they got a lot of feedback
of people saying that you shouldn't use
[SPEAKER_00]: water from your dehumidifier because it
contains heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they did was they went and tested
that and they found right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see my mouse pointer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aluminum, copper, zinc.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did show some copper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, copper is an element that
the plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did all different tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll actually put this in the Twitch chat
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen some aluminum and there's some
copper, but they're such small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very little impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parts per billion, I think is what they
were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to read through the whole
study here, but check it out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reference that study and
learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a question from Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should I buy the auto pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommend Happy Hydro to go there and
buy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually a sponsor of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto parts are an awesome auto water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no timers or electricity and they
have systems for all size operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the auto pot Excel in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really got some great results using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, it's a hundred pot system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have 16 pot systems, nine pot
systems, 60 pot systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have really for any applications
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also comes with a reservoir on a
lot of these kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely check them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link to the auto pots on the
Happy Hydro website down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you had one trellis net, when is the
best time to put it in during veg or right
[SPEAKER_00]: before flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to get mixed answers
depending on who you ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add it in veg before flipping the
flower, but there have been times where I
[SPEAKER_00]: added in the trellis net after flipping
the flower because I realized I was going
[SPEAKER_00]: to need some support.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the branches were kind of
starting to flop over and just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: structure kind of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked like it was going to be one of
those plants where once it gets deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering stage, the branches are just
going to be too weak to kind of hold its
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally will add in the trellis
net during vegetation stage at most times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll work that plant into the
trellis as it's continuing to grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: veg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it's just about filled up or
I don't really fill up my tents wall to
[SPEAKER_00]: wall, you know, whenever the structure is
where I kind of want to be it is what I
[SPEAKER_00]: should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'll go ahead and I'll flip
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've made the mistake of continuing to
bend down those branches for several weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then unfortunately the branches were
kind of stuck under and stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the buds were kind of within the
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't recommend doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, moving forward,
I'm only really doing seven days,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first seven days of the stretch phase
after switching the life cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: tucking down branches and then after that
kind of letting it go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What week of flower do you pollinate your
plants when making seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you let them mature before
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget who said this, but pollinate the
plants when they look horny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as funny as that may seem,
you can kind of think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is that point where the flowers have
grown to the point where there's pistil
[SPEAKER_00]: just bursting out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's around day 28 in the
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course it's going to depend on if
you're talking about when flipping the
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle, when the plants start to show
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to give you an exact
answer, but look around 28 days or so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's typically when I pollinate,
when the plant looks horny enough to want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you recommend for water testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very hard water, 800 ppm from the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people go through Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not the best person to talk to when it
comes about different testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Logan Labs is just one of those common
ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do both soil testing as well as water
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely want to refer you over to
the soil doctor, Bryant Mason.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually my podcast years ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good episode talking about soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He would be the one to kind of give you
insight about water testing and he can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually review your results and kind of
give you feedback on what nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your intrusion regimen should be,
what amendments you can add in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you let your soil sit before
reusing after amending it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I have planted in it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've waited a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've waited two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I waited a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've waited 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to give you the answer on what
the best time is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single time, no matter what,
even when I planted in the same day I
[SPEAKER_00]: amended it, it turned out to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people let it sit for seven days,
14 days, 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to hear different
recommendations from different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal opinion, seven to 14 days and
it should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's also going to depend on how
much you're actually amending in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're loading it with nutrition,
it could become hot really quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: risky in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you're just going to have to try
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried singin' a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have you done just fully organic or
fully bottled nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely done singin' organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some really good results doing singin'
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different ways you can
kind of go about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people will traditionally
go singin' organic where they start off
[SPEAKER_00]: with a potting mix that includes organic
nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, Fox Farm Ocean Forest
soil, and I know they're not OMRI
[SPEAKER_00]: certified or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some speculation whether or not
that mix is organic or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But assuming it is organic, that's an
example where you start off with a Fox
[SPEAKER_00]: Farm Ocean Forest mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're adding in synthetic
nutrients throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way of doing singin' organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also done, started off just in inert
soil or soil with not much nutrition in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Add in organic blend of amendments and
also fed in synthetics throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way to grow where if you need that
fast acting response, like say the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is starting to show like a sign of
deficiency or whatever, that's when I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like to just, hey, okay,
let me give it a real light dose of
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's in a plant available form
and so I can see a fast recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have anything against singin'
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get some really good results with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't discriminate organic versus
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not somebody who's going to be,
they refer to them as organic snobs to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's all organic and that's the only
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody who grows up bottles are
terrible people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottles are for babies, you know,
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I really haven't been using a lot
of synthetic nutrients in the past two
[SPEAKER_00]: years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just been organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic inputs, whether that be compost or
dry amendments, you know, whether it be a
[SPEAKER_00]: blend or individual amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been a little bit easier for me,
my style of growing to use organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, singin' organic is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you add your Power Bloom dry
amendments when flipping the flower before
[SPEAKER_00]: changing lights I go after?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Power Bloom a brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it is, then I don't use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But any blend that I use, organic blend,
I'm adding in a top dressing prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually it'll be upwards of seven days
before flipping a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's on the day of flipping the
flower, I'll top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's either on or before
flipping the flower is when I'll add in
[SPEAKER_00]: that top dressing of organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, once I change the
light cycle, it's usually about 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 to 30 days is when I'm doing that next
top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the book, Chris may even autograph it
for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you get it from my website,
mrgroot.com, buy through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave a comment on during checkout,
a note or a comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comment or whatever, and just say you want
it signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll go ahead and sign it and
ship it to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm only shipping to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: though, through my book, just because it's
so much money to ship to a different
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if you're in a different country,
other than the U.S., Canada, Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: anywhere, check your local Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be available on your local
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually go to amazon.com or
.eu or .uk or amazon.ca, amazon.de.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those should be available there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search just for my book.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to everyone who has left a
review on that book on Amazon,
[SPEAKER_00]: that has helped out tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over, I think it's 1,200 reviews on
that listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so thankful that you guys take the
time to actually go there, leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have uploaded pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have uploaded videos onto
Amazon and showed during their review.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps me out tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really gone beyond my expectations as
far as getting reviews on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once again, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enviro-Cleanse works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't even tell I have 54.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Enviro-Cleanse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you work with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of curious because, man,
they suck with communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even support them anymore because
their communication is just so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd be interested to know if you're able
to get a hold of somebody because I need
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a hold of somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it beneficial to top dress with
organics and then introduce microbes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can totally top dress with organics,
then include microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it depends on what you're talking
about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat here wants to jump on my lap,
so let me get him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics, so you're talking about like an
organic and put like compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Includes a lot of those beneficials
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding in a micro product, people will
still do it, but you might not really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say you don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you're top dressing with just
like an organic blend or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can totally inoculate with microbes
after, before, during, after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people that say you should
avoid buying micro products altogether
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can get them from your
backyard with the IMO process.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one stance on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people will, for convenience
purposes, buy microbes and inoculate their
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you overuse molasses in a grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a small amount to adjust my pH use
watering along with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually created a whole video on
molasses, and I think that's one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: said in the video is, oh, you really can't
overuse this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got roasted in the comments a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course, if you like, if you're
pouring a bottle onto your medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's overdoing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I kind of meant by that was like if
you're using a teaspoon per gallon or
[SPEAKER_00]: tablespoon per gallon of water,
and some people are doing it throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire grow successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I meant in that
video by not being able to overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly do small amounts
throughout the grow and be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally found most value in it in the
flowering stage, mid to late flowering is
[SPEAKER_00]: usually when I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it throughout the grow before,
no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single watering or every other
watering, I've done that as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's been fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you tried or considered doing
hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is kind of a hot topic in my
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked this a lot, and I have not
done a true hydroponic grow such as DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa is considered hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that, but DWC system,
for example, that's one of very common
[SPEAKER_00]: system that people use when growing
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not used yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only concern is that the water
temperature of the reservoir,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, where I live, I feel like
it would be difficult to control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, being a small home grower,
I feel like me investing for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and then monitoring it,
I think it's a little bit more to monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, oh, hydroponics is
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easier than growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than growing in soil,
higher yield, you get better turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear everything from so many different
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason why I, speaking for myself,
haven't yet grown hydroponics here is just
[SPEAKER_00]: because the temperature gets so high here
that I think it's going to be hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be between, I believe,
68 and 74 degrees Fahrenheit is the
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could be slightly off on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't quote me on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it goes 75 degrees Fahrenheit or
higher, you're at risk for bad pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could potentially do a DWC run in the
winter time, which is something I really
[SPEAKER_00]: should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do because temperatures are cold
and I don't think I'm going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about the water temperature as much
as I will in spring, summer and fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I haven't really tried doing a
DWC system hydroponic system like that
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but I'd love to try one in the future
when I feel like it's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done an episode on KNF?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have one planned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've done a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this episode right here with Green
Goblin episode number 47 is another one
[SPEAKER_00]: that he does talk about KNF a little bit
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green's goddess episode 57.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one on KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one right here has a lot of stuff
about KNF episode 59.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last one I'll recommend,
Chris Trump, well known for KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say this is a must watch
episode number 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: So check those ones out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll see you next
time.
