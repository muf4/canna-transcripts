[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk, you're gonna
leave that plant matter on there to help
[SPEAKER_00]: give the plant a little moisture and
enhance or extend that dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the exact same thing with trying to
remove dirt from your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just use water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The baking soda and the lemon juice work
together as an agent to remove that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of grime without using the word soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other way to harvest your
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wait for that stem to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me two harvests to realize that
was way too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've lost the moisture in the stem,
the buds are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first two weeks of cure does this
much to its smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But giving it a month, I think does that
to its smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two weeks minimum, but a month cure and
you're laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_01]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Pigeons420.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've actually been on my Garden Talk
podcast before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on episode number two, and we
talked all about training plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the record, it is the most viewed
or most watched Garden Talk episode as of
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: 303,000 views on YouTube alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just monstrous result off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're back again, and we're going to
get into harvesting, bud washing,
[SPEAKER_01]: drying, and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got famous off that first video,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for making the name, Pigeons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was definitely good when we
talked about training plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was just so many people that
commented, said they got so much value
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really revealed your techniques
and tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do a great job explaining things
in a more beginner-friendly manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you introduce yourself for those that
didn't catch the first episode we did
[SPEAKER_01]: together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a father.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a volunteer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a countryman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I make content online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been a journey, to say,
nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's had some peaks and valleys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But over the last, say, 12 months plus,
it's taken some incredible turns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the podcast, our FTS podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been really eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've met some really incredible people on
that podcast who've really opened up my
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and my perspectives on growing this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's allowed me to double down on my
own processes and make questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, I'm on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do gaming content, kind of lifestyle
content over there, and doubling down on
[SPEAKER_00]: my social media presence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope to hit 100,000 subs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, perhaps, by the next time someone
sees this, I'm already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's been an incredible journey,
to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still grinding, doubling down on just
being a full-time content creator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into... Let's start with
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first question I have for you,
is how do you determine when to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways to go about
it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will look at the actual
pistols of the plant, because maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have a microscope to look at the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will just look at the plants and see
if the leaves are fading.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant we're talking about,
the medicinal plant, is an annual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter how much nutrients you feed
it, eventually it's going to fade.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about determining when to
harvest your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if anyone's been following me for
a minute, they know that I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really a hands-on kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number one factor that comes to
harvest is, it's going to come down to
[SPEAKER_00]: your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often I find that I would love to be able
to harvest a plant when it's at its
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: When those trichomes are at their most
efficient, they're like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer a cloudy trichome, when that fade
is really starting to take on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you notice that it's taking less
water, it's taking less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: All great signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But often enough, I kind of get caught up
with life and work and family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing you know, I'm either harvesting
it too early, harvesting it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: too late, speeding up the process,
taking some corners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I was to have the optimal harvest
time, it would be, as I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for less intake on water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for that plant to show me that
it's ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's going to come down to the
water consumption, the trichome colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: that majority of milky trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a slight tinge of that
amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see a little bit of an
immature clear trichome as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of those things coming together
lets me know that it's going to be ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking through a microscope to get a
good close look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably should ask this first,
but do you flush your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very common technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're a precision grower with
synthetic nutrients, so you're not really
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A common technique is to flush your plants
or leach your plants prior to harvesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that be seven days prior to
harvesting, two weeks prior to harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people go longer than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the upwards of 21 days to where
they're just cutting off nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: just feeding plain water for the rest of
the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or some people running gallons of water
through the medium in order to remove as
[SPEAKER_01]: much of those nutrients as possible and
then allowing the plant to fade after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any type of flushing before you
harvest your plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't say before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's kind of a technical term,
but I think flushing is actually the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do flush because I personally believe
that you should maximize every moment,
[SPEAKER_00]: every day that you get in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be maximizing that in terms of
giving it as much food as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to give it as much light as it can
handle until that very last moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I find flushing is the most
effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when you are pushing the limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most flowers are going until about week
nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pushing right until week nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I see that it's ready to harvest,
boom, that's when it's a nice hard stop of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, and that's when I'm trying to
back down on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is a flush, not a leach,
so it's three times of the water the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of the pot is kind of the rule of
thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically going to last about seven
days, and not a whole lot longer than,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, seven to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to write anything down in stone,
but between seven and 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get two good heavy water flushes in
that time, and then it's going to get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dried out state enough where it's
harvestable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're flushing your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the last few harvests that I've had,
I've actually changed up my method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the podcast, I've been opened
up to the idea of not only 10 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing, but growing via a screen as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't want to use the actual term
for censorship reasons, but growing via a
[SPEAKER_00]: screen, I find it really maximizes space,
maximizes plant size, and that has
[SPEAKER_00]: introduced new methods for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, I've always done a wet trim,
chopped a plant, trim it, dry it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and away it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I decided to do a full plant dry,
where I would try to keep the plant intact
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as I could, trim it at its base,
hang it upside down, and then let it dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that I got a few more days out of
the dry, but not much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a few extra days, but not a whole
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the few extra days is a breaking
point, and one in which I'll take that
[SPEAKER_00]: extra days every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I did see a difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically, right after I find she's
ready to go, she's gonna get chopped,
[SPEAKER_00]: hung in a tent in approximately 60 degrees
freedom units, 65 degrees freedom units.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm gonna push around,
the humidity's gonna sit around that 60%
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult being in the corner of the
basement where I'm at, is to heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's a plus minus five, 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally speaking, cool, dark,
and not too damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything over 70, and you're kind of gonna
battle that mold issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, definitely kind of pushing that 70%,
but really giving it that buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I think 60% is a good humidity number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that lasted for about seven days this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and you mentioned that you prefer to
cut the plant at the base, so at the
[SPEAKER_01]: stock, and hang the plant whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you brought up a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally live in a desert climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at my humidity monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at 24%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's extremely low compared to other
parts, you know, other climates out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I do the same thing to where I'm
cutting at the base, allowing the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: be fully intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the branches, the buds are still
intact to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the leaves are kind of, overlapping
some of the buds, and it retains moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit better than it would be to,
you know, trim off the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut individual branches and hang them
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would lead to a more faster dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always battling with low humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always battling a proper dry time,
which we're gonna get into drying in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just wanted to emphasize that,
is that the cutting at the base versus
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting individual branches, you know,
can definitely conserve that moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And increase the dry time a little bit,
if you need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's beneficial for your climate,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I'm glad you mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more plant matter that's on there,
that's alive and not dead and crusty and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, wilted, you're gonna leave that
plant matter on there to help give the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a little moisture and enhance or
extend that dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I believe the same concept can be
applied to doing a dry versus a wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I keep the trim until the dry,
I've maximized the pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've maximized the plant material on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, giving myself a little more of
a head start or a little more advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to the end dried product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want, more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I dry trim, it's gotten the most
amount of time out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I prefer to dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not to mention, you can get a little
more tighter to the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying trimming, you know, it's a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you literally, I barely even feel
like you cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just kind of like slide the trimmers
along the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all those fan leaves can kind of
just kind of come off all on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's a lot easier, I feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's gonna be a lot of debate
in the comments section about wet trim
[SPEAKER_01]: versus dry trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wet trim is easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I think it definitely comes down to
personal preference on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, after you cut the plant down at the
base, one of the things you're known for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're very known for, you had one of the
top viewed videos of all time on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was Budwashing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what is
Budwashing and why do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy because I get afforded the guy
that Buds washes his buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it was my idea, but it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't my idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to take all the credit for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, it was actually, there was a guy I
followed by the name of DocBuds way back
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was in the forum days, before I was
vlogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was blogging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if he can take credit
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the one that introduced me to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, I'm one of the first ones
that put a video of it on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what it came down to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially a process of handling
your flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different than a tomato or a
potato or an onion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wash it when you get it out of the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That same concept's applied to harvesting
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until as of just a couple of harvests
ago, I washed every single harvest that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do so by combining three buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, it's five gallon pails.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those pails has a cup of baking
soda and a cup of lemon juice in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other two are just plain room
temperature water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chop your plants immediately after
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You chop your buds into arm size so they
can fit in a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You dunk it in the lemon juice and the
baking soda water first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're giving it a good swirl because you
are trying to eliminate the dust,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair, the grime, the bugs that are
inherently getting on your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would then drip dry a little bit over
the first bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apply it to the second bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're trying to get off the mixture
of both the baking soda and the lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you let that drip dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in the third bucket, you do the
same thing to just rinse the mixture off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest concern from people is,
aren't you wiping off trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Aren't you washing off trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is, yeah, of course you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some dead and degraded trichomes
that are present on those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There always will be from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes are present on plants almost
immediately from germination, from seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and almost all the way through veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are going to have trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those trichomes, all those single cell
trichomes, are going to degrade over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the flower period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have degraded past any point of CBN
or CBD or any kind of afterproduct of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do the rinse, those are going to
fall off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, when you hang them to
dry and they bang about and they go
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process, they're losing
trichomes every stage of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it have a negative impact on the
plants itself?
[SPEAKER_00]: The trichomes, the potency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoked some incredible herb that was
washed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, there's no argument to
whether it diminishes the potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: What opened my eyes in terms of whether or
not everybody, whether it was required for
[SPEAKER_00]: every single harvest, was performing my
last couple harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it via tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have great circulation via my AC and
infinities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a quality lung room, and that's
the room in which both my tents reside,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's sealed and the environments
within are sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a room within a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that there wasn't as much of a
need to wash your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was minimal hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying that it was just completely
sterile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was hair, but I didn't see the
amount that I was seeing before I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not one should wash every
harvest or not, that's up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be the guy that tells you
that you should or shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did sit on a pedestal and say that I
wouldn't smoke anyone else's because they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll backtrack those statements.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I want to know that the stuff
that I ingest is going to be clean
[SPEAKER_00]: regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know that it doesn't come in
contact with pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know that it was grown in a
sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know that it's free from
disease, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it being clean is another
variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a valid one, but it doesn't need to
be applied to everybody's stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a lot of people know that
trichomes, as they go out to different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages, clear, cloudy amber, they actually
get to the point where they become more
[SPEAKER_01]: brittle and actually snap off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually fall off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, those are the ones
that you're washing off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I've got to challenge you on this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the folks that prefer more amber,
maybe they prefer 30% amber, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: or more, would you say that they shouldn't
budwash because there's more jeopardy of
[SPEAKER_01]: them removing those trichomes with the
CBN, for example?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to know what the integrity of
those amber trichomes really are and at
[SPEAKER_00]: what point do they degrade to a point
where they're breaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I don't know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a science guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is that it's like you want to
have clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in an area that you're
not confident is producing sterile clean
[SPEAKER_00]: product, wash it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't question it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't question it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's my own opinion, but if
you're on the fence, you think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a state that's clean,
you prefer that CBN, you want those amber
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes, well just grow in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow in a tent with good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep your hands out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't drool all over your plants and
you're going to be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to the first bucket you talked
about, you talked about three different
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one has, correct me if I'm
wrong, it's a baking soda and lemon juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is the point of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't just plain water all the way
through be okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, trichomes are water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to lose anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to repel a lot of the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water alone isn't going to get in and
remove anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to just be pushed away by the
oils, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm reaching for this one,
but the baking soda is a natural soaping
[SPEAKER_00]: agent where it's going to sud and it's
going to get into the crevices to remove
[SPEAKER_00]: the hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lemon juice is a natural antiseptic,
which is then going to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to help remove and rinse the
grime away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working together, it's a pair that works
to just work as like a soap, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I'm hesitating here is because
I know people like to grab your work
[SPEAKER_00]: words.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I say soap, it's what's happening with
soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the exact same thing with trying to
remove the dirt from your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just use water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: The baking soda and the lemon juice work
together as an agent to remove that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of grime without using the word soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you dunk those branches into the
water, you mentioned you've got to give it
[SPEAKER_01]: a good swirl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you put amount of time to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you tucking five seconds worth of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking 10 seconds, 20 seconds?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in, you're swirling, just trying to
get in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, you know, and then you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So five seconds, you're out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not much more in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're again, you're not losing anything,
but you're not trying to abuse the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: either, which, which could definitely
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five seconds up to seven seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is that per each bucket or is
that for the first bucket with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you want to, you want a thorough
rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now is this going to make the drying
time longer?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make it longer at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, um, if there's anything I've
noticed, and then this is where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's, it, it, every harvest is a
little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some will argue that it's,
it has sped up their dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I haven't experienced that per se,
but I think it comes down really to your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I always have a hard time getting
to five days dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three, three to five days and it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was finding the exact same thing on
harvests where I wasn't washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's three to five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an unwritten rule and it
sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I'm drying in a tent,
we can get to this later.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's definitely changed that,
that time, but no, it does not enhance the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually found the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just curious on, on your findings
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bud washed, honestly, it's only been
about two or three plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, I did the same exact
method I use where we had the multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets swirled it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably swirled in it for about the
same amount of time that you mentioned and
[SPEAKER_01]: then hanging those individual branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it was, was about the same dry
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interesting to hear that you had the
same findings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like kind of reverting back to
the cut, the, the, the trimming process,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of that had to do with the
fact that we're trimming each and every
[SPEAKER_00]: branch, you know, and that's inherently,
that's going to speed up the dry
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you people have asked,
well, could you wash the whole plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, if you're going to,
if you're going to make a bucket big
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, you know, but then you're wasting,
you're wasting water, you're wasting time
[SPEAKER_00]: filling a bathtub to wash a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's necessary, but yeah,
I think a lot of that had to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've, you've washed your buds and
then now they're ready for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is your drying area set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost exactly like the growing setup
was, um, minus the light, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've still got the air circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me walk that back a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot less wind circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in my flowering tent, there is a lot
of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think honestly, you could light a
lighter in, in my flowering tent without
[SPEAKER_00]: it kind of like flickering out,
you know, because I'm trying to move so
[SPEAKER_00]: much air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do the opposite of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm start trying to dry, you know,
there's no fans on, uh, except for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, my, uh, I just called my AC infinity,
my inline, uh, people in my comments
[SPEAKER_00]: section were saying, that I didn't need to
have that on as well, but being in the
[SPEAKER_00]: basement, being at 60% moisture,
I've got an active humid, uh, humidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not make sense to me to not
circulate that air in there in some form
[SPEAKER_00]: or fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sealing it off for two weeks just seems
like just, just a calling card for
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture and mold and taking all that work
and just getting rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I, I think I, you know,
I did it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm very inexperienced when it
comes to tent growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always grown in a room that's like
80, eight by 10 feet by eight feet high,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, very large room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being in a four by four space,
I've got, I've learned a lot and both
[SPEAKER_00]: through experiment and failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this time I do believe that I went
about it correctly, but I did keep one
[SPEAKER_00]: small fan on at the very bottom of the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't think that was necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I should have just left the AC
infinity on and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, humidity in the tent was
set at about 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it fluctuated plus minus about six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw 66 and I saw about 54, 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very tough to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've, I'm only running a small,
um, air humidifier that holds maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: little less than a gallon, maybe a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a real pain in the butt trying
to, you know, you gotta, you gotta open
[SPEAKER_00]: that tent up at every 24 hours to fill
that humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just, it's plus minus and it's
really unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, that's as close as I've been to
a perfect dry ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was still plus minus six to 10
humidity and, and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your dry setup sounds very similar to
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned earlier in the episode,
I live in a very dry climate, so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: always battling trying to increase the
humidity, not only in my flower room and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but drying as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So primarily I dry in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried an open room before I dried in
bathrooms before, cause that was all that
[SPEAKER_01]: was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about all the germs,
the bacteria that might be floating around
[SPEAKER_01]: in that bathroom, but that's besides the
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but normally it would be in a grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a humidifier at the bottom of the
tent blowing up towards, not towards the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually blow it up towards the side of
the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have a oscillating fan on the
bottom of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the oscillating fan isn't blowing air
directly onto the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that it dries it out a lot quicker
when it's blowing directly on the buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but allowing the humidifier to blow that
humidity against the wall and a
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of adding the oscillating fan
there, it does sufficiently add the flow
[SPEAKER_01]: around the drying tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have the top ventilation
sock open on the drying tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I don't have an inline fan hooked up
to mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just basically have that oscillating fan
going and then air is just naturally come
[SPEAKER_01]: flowing out through the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, sometimes what I'll do is I'll crack
that grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have airflow that way as well if
needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every 24 hours I'm going in there and
checking to make sure that I'm exchanging
[SPEAKER_01]: the air entirely.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's any sort of musky smell,
I will, uh, I'll definitely take action
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, air it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, maybe I'll have to lower the humidity
that's coming out of the humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have a temperature
humidity monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the sensor push monitor and actually
hang that right down with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it'll be at the level where the
buds are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I get alerts to my smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime the humidity is off,
anytime the temperature is off,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I will be able to take action.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do anything in order to increase
the temperature or decrease the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Room temperature for me, I'm usually about
65, 70 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's usually fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people really like to go lower
than that, you know, 60 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough for me to get that low without
adding in a air conditioner or running the
[SPEAKER_01]: central air in my house, which of course
costs money and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's kind of a balancing
act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there, do you have to add in any sort
of cooling or I'll say it heating as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great Canadian argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the basement and it's, it's
naturally pretty chilly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I can't transition into freedom
units, but I'm going to say that like it
[SPEAKER_00]: just, uh, like on average, it's probably
about low sixties, high fifties in my
[SPEAKER_00]: basement all the time, all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure, that might be great for a,
for a, a drying, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not good for, for veg for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, let's flowering in general,
you know, you do want to have a little
[SPEAKER_00]: more control on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do actually have in my lung room,
I have a space heater that runs all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time and keeps the room at about a 70,
yeah, about 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The space, my lung room is my old grow
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's about eight by eight by 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that little space here,
but the two four by four tents in it works
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's on the outside of the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that enter that, that air is getting
sucked into the tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and yeah, like I also dry in a
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also dry in a tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like is AC infinity a sponsor here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shadow to AC infinity, ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and using promo code Mr. Grow it,
uh, or whichever, whichever one it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's, uh, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the, the, the smart controller
can read everything on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the diode that goes down into the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see or I can read how much
exactly the temperature is, how much the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can adjust the speed on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on how fast you want it,
I put it on one and it worked perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, this was a great dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was almost worried that I had overdried
at some stage, but nah, everything came
[SPEAKER_00]: out really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might actually overburped it here just the
other day, but leave it up to me to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, no, the inline, I really think
makes a world of a difference when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned your drying setup,
your drying conditions, how long you drive
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know when they're done drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I remember when I first got into doing
YouTube, everybody always said,
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for that stem to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no other way to harvest your
herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wait for that stem to snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me two or maybe two harvests to
realize that that is way too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've lost the moisture in the stem,
the buds are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buds are done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just feel like, I feel like you
don't want a complete snap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want the dust to fall when you
hit the, uh, when you, when you,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to bend that snap,
I like some rigidity to that stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to, you know, there's still a
little bit of a, but it's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it bends under almost its own pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like what you, if you might take it
off the rack a little early, you can make
[SPEAKER_00]: up for that in the cure or the burp,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I like to wait until the outside of
the buds are crispy and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, you're going to have one of
those buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a hands-on kind of guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a science to it,
but like I said, I'm a hands-on kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to grab a bud, there's
typically one bud more than others that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want to use, but you go and you
just mush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that bud on the outside is really
crispy, but you can feel it, it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: powder in your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, that's way too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that stem snapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you, you, you crush it and it's
still got a little bit of bounce to it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can feel that moisture in
there as you crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like crush, crush, crush,
crush, all of a sudden bounce like a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I know it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little bit of moisture left in
that bud that'll help me during the cure
[SPEAKER_00]: and that'll help pull out some of those,
those flavors and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it won't, it'll give me that,
that margin of error during the curing
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely go by the wayside of the,
the snapping of the branch, wait till you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a nice little crunch on the buds
with a little bit of moisture and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the plants are dry,
you do the trimming process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming process is extremely time
consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I remember it was like first time
I ever trimmed a plant, it was like four
[SPEAKER_01]: plus hours for this medium sized plant,
you know, that just took up a two foot by
[SPEAKER_01]: two foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very tedious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can do a sloppy job and maybe
not get all of the leaves off of there and
[SPEAKER_01]: speed up some things and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do you have any general tips overall
for the trimming process?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trimming sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The novelty of trimming wears off around
the second or third harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's ridiculous how you said it
tedious.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of cases, your back gets sore,
your fingers get sore, hanging onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: stems and you're like, you can feel it in
your palm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is, it's, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, first thing you can do is
just harvest less plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, do you really need
this many?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big thing that I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a perpetual gardener and I have had a
continuous garden going for, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 plus years easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have way too much, way too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I, I, you know, maybe it's a,
it's a first world problem, but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing stuff away left, right and center
because it's either way too dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's losing its color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been in the drawer forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, even the goats would need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, ask yourself how many plants
you really need to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that, that would be the biggest
question because if you can get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: two instead of four, do the two,
that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, uh, yeah, I definitely get
sloppier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you first start harvesting
the, the plants you're, you're trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: are just, you got so tight to the bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing them off to your buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the best trimmed buds you've
ever seen in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: By harvest four, five, six, you don't even
care anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just like, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even worry about it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even trimming that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like it, you kind of get a little
bit looser, but to, to, to really maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your, uh, your, your trimming time,
make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, I believe in trim parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got buddies or friends or your
wife or your husband, and you just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get a job done, turn it into a party,
kick on your favorite Taylor Swift song,
[SPEAKER_00]: get your favorite drinks, have over some
friends, get them trim and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got a nice smoke supply to keep
them happy and make the best of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I prefer to stand rather than sit
because I find standing just allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: like get a little bit loose and,
and, and trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, sitting over such a long
time can be a real pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good set of trimmers goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and, and I, and I mean that
because, uh, you know, if having to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know, for four plus hours is,
is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, you don't have a set of trimmers
that auto opens, you know, you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use scissors where you have to do both
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to have a spring in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, some people, some people swear by
Fiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, uh, just use whatever ones
that I can find at my local hardware store
[SPEAKER_00]: for a fraction of the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just something that's going to work
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a long pair and a small pair and
yeah, go ham, make it fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my best advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people use the trim trays
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you use those or not,
but that actually helps with the dry sift,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause they have that screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as that trims running across it,
the trichomes are falling down onto that
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom part and you can actually scrape
that up and use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So have you used any of the trim trays or
no?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't used the bowl or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I will, I have like, I use an electric
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, those things for doing big colas are
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, very speedy, very fast or speedy and
faster, the same thing, but very
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, cost wise, you gotta be careful which
ones you get cause you can break bank for
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these electric trimmers that not
necessary in terms of the price,
[SPEAKER_00]: but definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the downside of using one of
these screens that I used was that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there goes an electric trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: These buds are not as big as my forearm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're, they're a lot smaller,
which made it a little more tedious,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more time consuming, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been wanting to try those bowl
trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think AC infinity just dropped one of
them actually two different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I think there's like a 16 and a
19 inch or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, seems to make it much faster of a
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just worry, which I think a lot of
people worry about is the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you get out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So interested now in the comment section,
has anybody used any of those trim
[SPEAKER_01]: machines or, or bowl trimmers or anything
like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know your experience on it and if
it's worth picking up and using or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into curing next.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, definitely an important process
that you can get through your growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get through the, the harvest dry,
the mud washing, all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could completely mess it up,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And throw it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you got mold appearing on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very, very important process is the
home stretch there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how do you go about curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, um, that's also one of those
learning, learning, uh, experience things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you'll only get better with over time
and through harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to do it right a few times and
I've had to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few times to really understand what the,
what's your margin of error is when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I do say that you can take it
off the, the, um, the dry rack a little
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker and have some playtime in the
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of, or trying to draw out
that dry, but if the more moist that you
[SPEAKER_00]: put those buds in the jar, if that makes
any sense, the more likely are you are to
[SPEAKER_00]: get mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if you are trying to put them in a
jar sooner, you know, you've got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: very vigilant in terms of trying to avoid
that buildup of moisture in your jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I much rather through experience,
over dry my, my bud and put it in the jar
[SPEAKER_00]: than, than have it more moist and put it
in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I, I often find that when I think
I've over dried my product, when I put it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the jar, and give it a good 24 hours,
the moisture is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never really gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and you know, you touch those buds,
it's like, Oh, Oh, they are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: sticking to each other in the,
in the jar still, you know, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, generally speaking, I use about,
I think I should go bigger because my
[SPEAKER_00]: harvests are typically a pound or larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I should be using like volts in
terms of both those sea vaults,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm using, um, the glass, kind of
Mason jars, but one court I've been using
[SPEAKER_00]: those faithfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, fill those like a chip bag,
three quarters of the way full seal it off
[SPEAKER_00]: right on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in a cold or cool dark area in the
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, typically in the exact same
temperature that I, it was drying in,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, there's not much different
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, trying to keep it in around that 60,
62% is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you're playing the plus minus
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any hydrometers that you use, use are
typically plus minus in their own right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so tough to get that perfect
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't use hydro packs, um,
like I E Pavita, um, mainly because I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it takes a lot of my vigilance out of
the game, like out of the deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes my diligence out of the,
out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like when you get this far,
don't trust on a humidity pack to get you
[SPEAKER_00]: through the burping phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not talking about a longterm storage
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about those first couple of
weeks after your harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe a Pavita pack is,
is going to do you any justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing 90% humidity in those jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes immediately after harvest that,
that, that Pavita packs just being
[SPEAKER_00]: inundated with moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you want to, you know,
keep an eye as soon as you harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: put them in the jars every 24 hours,
you're going to be burping typically for
[SPEAKER_00]: about a week, give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, you can't take, take any of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: For, for just you got to take it with a
grain of salt because every environment's
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit different, but typically
within the first week I'm burping every
[SPEAKER_00]: day after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically every few days,
two or three days, just based on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture is being retained.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after two, three weeks,
four weeks, it's pretty well good for
[SPEAKER_00]: about once every month to be burped.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not unusual to be sitting in a jar
for six, eight, 10, 15 months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So longterm storage, I do believe in a
Pavita pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in those, those moisture
packs because they will maintain that
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in there for a longterm period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I P I think people often believe that if
you just throw a moisture packer pack in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, it's going to take that 90%
humidity and just bring it down to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you've got 30%, it's just going to
bring it up to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's, it's just the wrong,
wrong methodology for those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of newbies watching this one
here and you definitely covered a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: it in detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Container using temperature, humidity,
burping, break down the details.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly, how do you burp the jars?
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down to where you are,
like how long you let them dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you've got an incredible
amount of moisture in there, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, there's a buildup of CO2,
there's a buildup of moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a buildup of, of, of, of just
undesirable gases inside that jar as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it needs to be expelled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got way too much moisture in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pushing 90 plus and that's not
unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to actually get those buds out of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, if you fill this jar up
three quarters of the way full and you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to look at the jar after a 24 hour
period, those buds are stuck to each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, I can shake the jar and I can try
to get those buds out of there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're stuck to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to get them out and unstuck to
free them, you got to get them out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to sometimes put them out over
top of like a pan or something or a desk
[SPEAKER_00]: or a table or something clean and just let
them sit for about half hour, 45 minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: until again, the outsides of those buds
are similar to the work they were when
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you took them off the dry rack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're crunchy on the outside,
moist on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a great candy commercial,
but it's, it's, you're going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one of those buds, unfortunately
isn't going to be survived.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to survive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's going to be your tester and
you're going to just molest it
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to know,
you're going to know, okay, it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: ready to go back in the jar for another
12, 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you at the beginning of the burp?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, you're probably going to come back
in 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Best way to check on your, your,
your jar without actually opening it was
[SPEAKER_00]: what I said there kind of kind of shake it
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if those buds are kind of tumbling in
there on their own, they're probably good
[SPEAKER_00]: for like another, you know, 12 hours and
then do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go in there so often if
the moisture level isn't so high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use hydrometers, but again,
it's, it's plus minus those things are
[SPEAKER_00]: plus minus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do, I do recommend using hydrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just don't rely on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I kind of compare it to the analogy
of being lost in the woods with a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone who's lost in the woods with a gun
is far less likely to survive than
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who gets lost in the woods
without a gun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because as we tend to become
too competent in our tools and we think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the gun, what's the gun going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The gun can't get water for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gun can't get, you know, it can't
bring wildlife to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, you know, it's, it's a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you rely on hydrometer,
rely on these tools, a I E these Bavita
[SPEAKER_00]: packs or, or sorry, I don't want to throw
Bavita under the bus here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These hydro packs and these, these
hydrometers, then you, you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, you, you can be, I'm not saying
everyone, but you can be less likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just don't rely on it so heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot, a lot of this can be figured out by
feel and by site.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those little mini hydrometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the, not only the humidity,
but also the temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fell into the trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rely on those a hundred percent and a
lot of people do rely on a hundred cent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be accurate, but the ones that I
was using, unfortunately I had a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: that were inaccurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And although it said it was 62% RH,
which a lot of people deem as the ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, unfortunately mold appeared on
the buds and I lost two jars because it
[SPEAKER_01]: said 62%, but actually looking at the
jars, they were actually a white fuzz,
[SPEAKER_01]: like actual mo mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I threw those things out because
those ones weren't accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, you bring up a great point is
like, you might want to actually have like
[SPEAKER_01]: another measurement to kind of compare it
to, to make sure that there's accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just trust it right out of the box
that it's going to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Test it first to make sure because you
could spoil your harvest from it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and just because it's accurate on,
in June doesn't mean it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate in August or May of the next
year, you know, and, and that's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that you just need to
take into consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, there's other,
there's other methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it, there's other methods,
use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, just because it says 62% in the
jar, that doesn't mean that it's not 75%
[SPEAKER_00]: between two buds in this little tiny
corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like to rotate the,
the jar, get the buds to kind of tumble
[SPEAKER_00]: inside, move them about.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I noticed that kind of two buds are
stuck together, that's a great indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: that I needed to get in there and kind of
just get them unstuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, yeah, just be vigilant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vigilant is key for being, for curing
burping and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when are the buds ready to consume?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's the key is I also say that you
need product to harvest product.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd say it so much better if I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, is that it's like,
you can't get to the end if you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: something to ingest yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's, it's very tough to,
to sit there and watch this beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: plant just staring at you and,
and you just want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have anything, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You won't let it get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing is, is you need to be in a
good state to get to a good harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when's a good time to ingest it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you need it, that's my first
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's, once it's, if you got
through a dry period and you got through a
[SPEAKER_00]: burp and you got, you got a cure of really
any sorts, it dive in, don't go hungry
[SPEAKER_00]: with a fridge full of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the first thing I would
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I would say is that if
you've, if you've got something to ingest
[SPEAKER_00]: while it is doing its thing and you're
okay, you're comfortable two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum, minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're doing yourself an
injustice.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do it after two weeks,
if, if two weeks minimum, you're a cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ingest it personally though.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can wait a month, a month in the
cure that two, that if you had ingested it
[SPEAKER_00]: on two weeks versus the month,
it's a world of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I once read and I live on bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a third degree black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the, uh, the, I believe that if with a
proper cure, you can pull out the
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining potential of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now everyone says, yeah, of course,
curing does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, but I think a good cure,
a good cure goes like a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you were to put it on a scale
and say like all your efforts and work in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower is going to do this much to
its, its, its smoke ability, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the work you do in the flower stage is
going to do this much compared to its
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the amount it does to in the
first two weeks of cure does this much to
[SPEAKER_00]: its smoke ability, but giving it a month,
I think does that to its smoke ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's so I'm two weeks minimum,
but a month cure and you're laughing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, two weeks in the minimum is when
I'll touch it, but usually I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: stockpile kind of like you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 30 days is really when I'm testing it
out for myself and that's you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: two weeks in, you taste the, the greenness
or a lot of people say chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after a month or so, like
sometimes you can still taste it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but most of the time that that's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really feel like 30 days at the
minimum is usually when I'm testing it out
[SPEAKER_01]: and get a much better flavor than two
weeks in, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I mentioned earlier, there's a lot
of new folks listening in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a large handful of people
who have haven't even gone through their
[SPEAKER_01]: first harvest yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other advice do you have for somebody
who is new to these processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: See, again, I'm not a science guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a life guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you need to make this system work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make your harvest work for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if, if you are new to it, um,
you know, you don't have to go overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy the $200 trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to buy all the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need fancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to throw any brands under the
bus here when I do this, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't need any fancy curing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need any, you can keep this
really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the key because this is
your first time and a lot can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not trying to scare anyone,
but when I, when I was given my little
[SPEAKER_00]: scale there, the same thing can go towards
like the, the, the amount of risk that's
[SPEAKER_00]: involved, you know, um, and the later you
get into the process of harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more risk is involved in, in things
going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and all it takes is just a less of a
mistake and, and things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, over oversimplifying or, or,
or overcomplicating the process is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things where it's like, you,
you feel like you need all the best
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the best, um, uh, jars you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do put a lot of weight on getting it
right, but there's a lot more ways to get
[SPEAKER_00]: it right than there are to get it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the ways to get it wrong are
really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, but anyways, anyways,
as I contradict myself, the idea would be
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it fun, make it comfortable and
make it work for you, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, incorporate people that you trust and
you love into the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll help make the process go a
lot longer or a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because you can talk to somebody,
you can, you can enjoy the process with
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody and it's, it's just that much
more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, standing, as I said, like when you,
when you harvest, standing and not sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting the right pair of trimmers for you
is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just, yeah, yeah, do your homework,
do your homework.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so, today there's so many more
resources on the internet to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of relate to or kind of dive into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to listen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's between the two of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have very different growth styles in
many different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've tried out a million different ways
than I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, you've got guys like,
uh, R O B C L T V, you know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: Trey, even between the two of them,
they do things very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got guys, like, uh, you know,
um, uh, hi again, you know, they do things
[SPEAKER_00]: very differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, Mr. Canuck, for example,
does things very differently and find,
[SPEAKER_00]: find a routine that works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find something that works for you and try
to adapt it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're anything like me,
you're going to take a little bit of all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these people and you're going to,
you're going to, you're going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: something of your own and you're going to,
you're going to make that famous and call
[SPEAKER_00]: it your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you did it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you have upcoming in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, first of all, uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy what you, you are doing
with this, with this platform and with
[SPEAKER_00]: the, with your shows and, uh, the amount
of information that this podcast has done
[SPEAKER_00]: for the community is I think, uh,
second to none, second to none,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you've brought creators,
the way you've brought talent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the way you've brought scientists,
the way you've brought technicians,
[SPEAKER_00]: hobbyists together is, is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I applaud you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an absolute honor to not only be
the first or the second, but at the most
[SPEAKER_00]: viewed, but the second time being on here,
it's, it's, it's a lot of titles to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, for those watching, um,
I I I'm on YouTube as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me at Pigeon's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on my at, um, I'm on Twitch as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pigeon's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Pigeon's 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we've got the from the stash podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do top buds live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Monday, Wednesday, Fridays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a morning show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about everything and, uh,
I'm sure we're going to get canceled to
[SPEAKER_00]: someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that over on Twitch as well
at, uh, top buds live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, I'm, I'm getting around
when it comes to the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing some traveling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I, I know these really two other
two cool guys that I do this podcast with,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, we do some traveling together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I got them coming to Canada,
depending on when you see this,
[SPEAKER_00]: they may have, or may not have already
been here, but, uh, yeah, the future is
