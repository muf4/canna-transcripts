[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the fourth and final episode of
the Happy Hour podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a podcast that no longer exists,
the channel that it was on before no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer exists, but I thought it was worthy
of a repost onto this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, Chris from Happy Hydro
and myself sit down with JJ Kitchen from
[SPEAKER_00]: Uptown Grow Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the author of The Kitchen,
and he's been growing since the 70s,
[SPEAKER_00]: so he's a lahod of knowledge, many many
years of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about his old grow style,
we talk about his new grow style,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's got several funny stories in this
episode that he talks about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about miscellaneous topics like
spider mites, LED grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some other topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: No video on this podcast, just audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you still enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next Saturday I will resume the
Garden Talk episodes, and that'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: posted every Saturday from here on out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are live, and I am joined
here with JJ Kitchen from UptownGrowLab
[SPEAKER_00]: .net, and I've got the host here,
I'm the co-host, we've got Chris from
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, fellas, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're gonna learn all about Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All about Jay all the time today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get into the nitty gritty,
but first, if we could just do kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a high level background on you,
just real high level, kind of who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure, I'll give you my elevator
pitch.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in the Midwest, I was diagnosed
with Crohn's colitis when I was like
[SPEAKER_01]: probably 13 or 14 in that range,
and I got busted for cannabis in 1973 when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 17 when I wasn't even smoking yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ironically enough, a buddy of mine had his
stash, and I was driving and went through
[SPEAKER_01]: an amber light at like two in the morning,
and where I lived, it was pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was not a lot of light pollution,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the sheriff's car pulled out behind me
because I blew this light, or he thought,
[SPEAKER_01]: and my dim-witted friend crawled down the
window and threw in his entire stash in
[SPEAKER_01]: this big freezer bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course, the cop car is right behind
us, and all they can see is what the car
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's coming out the windows in front
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a movie, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was over right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they threw us in the county jail,
and ever since then, I've been on a
[SPEAKER_01]: crusade to smoke and decriminalize it,
I guess, at least in my own mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, man, and you have a YouTube channel,
and how many subscribers do you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: and what type of videos do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 27,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I really started doing it about a
year and a half ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved out to Seattle from New York City
with my wife and one of my daughters in
[SPEAKER_01]: December of 2015, and I kind of made a vow
that year as a New Year's resolution to do
[SPEAKER_01]: a video a day because all the gurus say
you got to be consistent and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth, and then my health got really,
really, really, really, really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Crohn's disease came back with a
vengeance, and really long story short,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a colectomy, which is where they
take out part of your colon, and they gave
[SPEAKER_01]: me a colostomy bag, which is basically you
poop into a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was last May, and then they put me
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really recent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they, but thank God, you know,
I think with the Humira and a lot of herb,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in its various forms, they reversed
it, so they closed me up in December,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now I'm just, I'm fatter, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually gained weight for the first
time in a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to have you here,
and we're stoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're stoked to hear that you're
living your dream here, but this YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: channel, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could make some bread often,
it'd be even cooler, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have this whole new algorithm thing
where very few people who do any kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, even a semi-controversial get any
kind of mainstream advertised money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't let me monetize about 90% of
my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still, you know, a lot of people
think that cannabis is like liberated,
[SPEAKER_01]: and well, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to federal, you're gonna have to
deal with a lot of restrictions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have to be really creative,
and I'm not a big business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just, you know, I'm a retired
attorney, like I was telling you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: before we went on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a retired administrative law judge out
of New York, and I'm not really making
[SPEAKER_01]: much money at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really doing this for my passion,
and that's how the book, The Kitchen,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we did came about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really a passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was gonna ask you about your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tabletop book, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a second to light this up,
and I'll grab a copy.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so this is the book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote it with my growing partner,
Tweezy, Uncle Tweezy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Tweezy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Tweezy from New York City.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, you know, it's all,
all the photography is mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won a couple of independent book awards
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran about, we highlighted about 20
streams that we grew from about a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: different breeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Readers from around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this book actually is signed by George
Clinton from Parliament Funkadelic and
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the members of his band.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's incredible, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a labor of love, which kind of
fucked up my financial world as I
[SPEAKER_01]: self-published it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was expensive?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just, it was what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cost some bread, but you know,
it's a beautiful, I mean, Ed Rosenthal's
[SPEAKER_01]: got in his front office and that's the
book that they aspire to produce,
[SPEAKER_01]: which they're never going to, but that's
their best book, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you still selling it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it available anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's available on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: People just have to type in on Amazon if
they search for Uptown Grow Lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just so you've got our website,
UptownGrowLab.net.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, let's kind of reset here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know, how did you first get into
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like where did it all start for you and
growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started my sophomore year of
college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some, I had some like four foot long
fluorescent lights, which I popped in some
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was 1974.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this in the dorms?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I lived off campus my sophomore year
and I had a, we had like a duplex with
[SPEAKER_01]: bedrooms were in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had a little corner in my bedroom set
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a couple of grow lights and you know,
it was all Mexican brick, weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, that kind of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally, you know, you started when
you went, I went to school in Boston.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of rich college kids
there, you know, there's a lot of smokers
[SPEAKER_01]: there on the coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of got into it there and it was
more of a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember my senior year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I graduated, we moved into this big
apartment on Marlboro street, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: like this really nice tree line street in
the back bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of a brownstone, but not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had these huge walk-in closets in this,
this crib.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had like eight plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the lights up there and I told my
roommate to water them.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this mother?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were grow, they were grow,
you know, sunlight tubes, whatever they
[SPEAKER_01]: called them back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is they weren't even
grounded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you touched them the wrong way,
you got shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What year is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This, that was probably 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 78.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I told my roommate to water the plants
while I was going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the LSATs and I went cross-country
with my girlfriend, the guy, but watered
[SPEAKER_01]: them once and forgot about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they all died.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming that's the end of that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I moved to New York city and I
was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was still, it was really bunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the, you know, I tried to find
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard a rumor that there was a
nursery out somewhere in Brooklyn that had
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't even find the damn place.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was in the early eighties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like a little apartment in the
West Village and I grew some plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, I used a lot of miracle
rope, heavy nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would spark up and it would spark
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see little things at the end of
the joint, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I kind of pulled back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, very.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I kind of pulled back because I
got married and then I had kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went to Amsterdam,
my wife and I and the kids a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was hanging out at the shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long story short, ended up setting up a
grow thing in New York city for my own
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got into it, you know,
I had like a little, a friend of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: called it the sugar comb hideout.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a small studio apartment where
I had like two grow tents and then I had
[SPEAKER_01]: the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all and it was all this old
plumbing and heating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't practical at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got mugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was doing it with a buddy of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to have to get stripped down to
our undies because it was so hot in there
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the apartment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like just in the rooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was like a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was two rooms, like the kitchen,
which was about two by.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only place where there wasn't a plant
was the bathroom, you know, sleeping under
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was really sleeping there very
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out there during the day
sometimes, but I wasn't spending the
[SPEAKER_01]: nights there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so then we something happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a real asshole neighbor and I just,
you know, I also wanted to get rid of the
[SPEAKER_01]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone got murdered on the block
and I was coming down from the apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day, one like a night that happened or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there were people talking to the
dormant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew these guys were cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just look, you know, there is
Plain Coast cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They look like cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no, but in this situation they
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that I took that as a sign to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny because when that
happened, I was actually transporting
[SPEAKER_01]: plants from that location uptown to
Harlem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was sort of between runs and I saw
cops hanging out and I just held back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was that kind of yeah,
it was pretty weird how it all worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we found this awesome place up in
uptown that had perfect ventilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on the top floor, like 11th floor
apartment, nothing around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like sort of a tower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get great cross ventilation and no real
neighbors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just couldn't imagine growing in the
city like apartment buildings and with
[SPEAKER_02]: elevators and stairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was kind of ballsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, definitely ballsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little terrifying a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I remember I had a really bad
fight with my wife and she was at my place
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I don't know about how it
is here or where you guys are at,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's certainly New York City domestic
violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take you to jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even need to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody tells the cops that you beat
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You laid hands on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in Rikers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sitting in this apartment with not
a lot, but it was a lot, certainly for a
[SPEAKER_01]: New York studio apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were having a real set to and I was
just really lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have been a guardian angel,
I think, or at least did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've done this for a lot of my
life, but so far, no, no, no big issues
[SPEAKER_01]: with weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No issues with weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where the name came from Upsound
Grow Lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to start to be chill,
you know, as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you say, Mr. Grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that where the name came from Upsound
Grow Lab?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of because, you know,
we, you know, we were talking before about
[SPEAKER_01]: eclectic growing styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we were, I was doing organic
when I hooked up with Tweezy and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: went to hydro or aeroponics and then deep
water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we brought it all back to
organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I left the city, when I left,
that's when he was running.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was running, had been
running out here for the last 18 months or
[SPEAKER_01]: so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you change so much?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just wanted to experiment or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I had this fantasy that I was going
to make a photo of money growing and all
[SPEAKER_01]: these like more tubular grow systems,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like arrow flows or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had like, I think eight airflow
machines going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we did get some yield,
but we were kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we weren't really smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't, we all, we kept telling
ourselves we got to grow just one strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: just one strain, you know, but we liked
the plant too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grew a bunch of different streams
all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you didn't like, if you would have just
stuck with one consistent, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: high yielding strain, you think you would
have probably, we would have killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you like, are you using environmental
controllers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you, can you tell me like what's going
on now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the flower room, I mean,
in the, let's start at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just took about, I'm going to say 25
to 30 clones for two different strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that worked for calling Ashley's
Uptown Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend Ashley 420, positive smash 420,
she found a seed in a bag that she bought
[SPEAKER_01]: at a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a Blackberry, a Blackberry
Kush or some sort of Berry Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we momed her out and took like a bunch
of clones off of her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have something called Northern
Monkey, which is a cross of Uptown Girl
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab's Monkey Boy Kush, which is
essentially a Reserva Provata.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sour crossed with an OG Kush, if I'm not
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was crossed with a Northern Lice
Number 5 from Bodhi Seeds, sort of totally
[SPEAKER_01]: by happenstance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got those, I just put them in dirt
last week and I'm watering them with Kyle
[SPEAKER_01]: Cushman's Vega Matrix.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this, is this under T5 lights or HPS?
[SPEAKER_01]: The clones are under, well, they're under
a CFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: One CFL.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in five by fives, you know,
we call them Dillon's Square Pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like five and a quarter by five
and a quarter.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're popular for flood tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like laying out a four by,
a three by three card table.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you, you have like a big tray or
anything for runoff?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have about four different trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's eight of those, eight of those
pots fit in one tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got four trays in the,
in the tent on the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is stage one, your humidity,
like do you have to do anything to control
[SPEAKER_02]: that or?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, man, I really, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it in like a, is it in a basement or
something where there's like cold
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's in, I have this little
outbuilding where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an unheated, uninsulated,
I'm pretty sure, because it gets cold in
[SPEAKER_01]: here in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Office space, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 175 square foot room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a three by three and a four by
four foot grow tent, for real,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the one tent where I've got the
clones, I just put some seeds in some,
[SPEAKER_01]: they call them root riots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're from, I don't know,
Sungrow Company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Root riots, I've heard of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like a little, they're a little
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they're pre-cut and they're
already wet when you get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just put those 10 fems in there and
those are underneath the car table,
[SPEAKER_01]: which also has another CFL hanging from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tiered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a duplex.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's in the three by three and I'm
waiting for those to come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just put them in yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other tent I've got also,
that's the bigger tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably a bill collector.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be a bill collector.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so the other tent, the four by
four, is the top half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're all like either plants that
are from seeds or from clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a white Russian mom that I got
from a seed from a series of seeds in
[SPEAKER_01]: Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a regular seed and I did a gender
test on them through Phyllis Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I cloned her mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a room of about 20 white
Russians that are flowering out now.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got about, how many plants do I
have there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got, I've got 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in three gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blooming or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, sort of super cropping them
and tying them down, keeping them short.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got something called guide dog,
which is from a guy named Nick Tops in
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a Holy Smoke Seeds is his,
his company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this guide dog, the one that I did
grow was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to see if I can replicate
that with one of his trains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've just got some chronic,
just so that when I cut, which is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be in about five weeks, I'll have
something to slide in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put them in like bigger pots and
they'll really kind of get much bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: before I flip them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I ask you about super cropping?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you just give the listeners a quick
overview as, I mean, as quick as you
[SPEAKER_02]: really can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a, it can get complicated,
but, um, super cropping to me is just
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, uh, you know, squeezing this,
the top most generally stem, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: below the like flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just squeezing it to the point where
you almost hear a crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you let go, it'll just like droop
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not, you haven't really,
um, serrated or cut the flesh of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have the, the, the eight to 10 plants
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your veggie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I may bring them out of the, uh,
uh, to the outdoors, depending on the next
[SPEAKER_01]: month or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like I got about 10 outside
already and they're really loving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, do you still do indoors in the
indoor bloom too or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I've got about 125 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, in my garage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use them like umbrellas or
air-cooled hoods or.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two dimmable thousand watt
lights, uh, framing a 600 watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem is it's been really very
warm out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just been running them all at 600.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just too hot to run the thousands
because I don't have any air conditioning
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically the Seattle climate is pretty
forgiving in the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, but it's been fairly sunny
lately, so that kind of pops things up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're, you're, they're not air-cooled
hoods on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have an intake fan and a,
and a, uh, exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I've got three oscillating fans on
the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probably helps you during the winter
time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said it gets a cooler in the winter
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't get freezy freezy,
but it definitely gets it can get cold
[SPEAKER_01]: enough in that room where I sometimes
think about putting a space heater in,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then when I do, I kind of freak myself
out about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's definitely can retard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those, one of those
environmental challenges that I have out
[SPEAKER_01]: here for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I'm going to spend a fair amount of
money to remedy it, which I'm not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, I just have to live with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, I've started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a regulator, which I think is
tough because I just got a brand new CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: tank today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not, they're not fitting cause
the CO2 is shooting out of the tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you might, uh, did you make sure
there's a little rubber?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it's made out of rubber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually it might be plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gasket that goes between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something got blown across the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I worked at the gross store,
we dealt with people all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing them back saying that they didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you just, yeah, you know,
see if they, there's this little gasket
[SPEAKER_02]: that comes in every, an O-ring.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not on, it's between the valve
and the unit, the pluggy unit,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pluggy unit thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it made total sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you, um, do you have like an
environmental controller for the CO2 or
[SPEAKER_02]: are you just using a timer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it on the timer, which I have to go
and reset.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a digital timer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like for the first 45 minutes it's
on when the lights go on, then every 50
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes, every hour there after 48 hours,
I think.
Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I mean, honestly, my plants are
looking a little bit skinny this time
[SPEAKER_01]: around, but the white Russian,
I have to, when I, when I say that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell me as a grower, I always think
around, you know, four weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest that my plants aren't going to be
heavy enough and I could be fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get, they start bulking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're still white.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all white.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, there's no discoloration yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in dirt for these or like what
size pots are they in for me?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've been doing is, uh, there's a
company called ion organic and they make
[SPEAKER_01]: a, uh, it's a peat, basically an infused
peat potting mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a just add water mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically we did most of the plants
that are flowering out now are in that
[SPEAKER_01]: mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a half a dozen that we're
running just with water, just to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just plain water and whatever nutrients
they have in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I've been, I've been pruning
them like everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then the rest of the room is being run
mostly in that, uh, mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the big pots, like the 10 gallons
and even some of the sevens, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: about a half a dozen plants, I'm sort of
doing a no-till thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically just pulled out the root ball
and dropped in the clones and cover them
[SPEAKER_01]: up with fresh soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just keep the same soil, keep letting
itself compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're adding your top dressing
Bokashi or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you'll let it like, hello,
you know, um, like I've got a friend in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon who, um, what do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow in like these 200 gallon earth
pots, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or cloth pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legal grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they cut, they basically cut out,
take out the center mass, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the root ball is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll, they'll cover it with
whatever bone meal, Bokashi, hay,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, dry, dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll let us sit over, over the
winter, you know, three to five months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll drop in the new clones
and do some sort of top dress and take it
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I do for my vegetable garden
outside, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's the same principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the problem, I think,
with a lot of growers and that's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that we are sold a lot of product
that you really don't necessarily need.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even indoor growers don't need all the
bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, I'm just curious about Remo.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody, one of my subscribers sent me an
email about them and he said, you really
[SPEAKER_01]: have to watch it because if you look like
one milliliter more per gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get burned, you know,
and I take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the dangerous part about
using multiple bottle systems is if you
[SPEAKER_02]: miss, if you, if you mess up, if you have
one of the bottles and there's six of them
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes into a water mixture,
then you just wreck the whole mixture,
[SPEAKER_02]: mixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how you're going to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's also more, more, um,
it has more of a deleterious effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in hydro soil, there's a buffer
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to, you're going to catch a
break with soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's in hydro, like a deep water
culture system, water them in the day and
[SPEAKER_01]: go away and come back at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could kill everything for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your soil grower tried and true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the real deal, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got the earthworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was a hydro store in Seattle,
Seattle, uh, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently the law changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he wasn't getting a lot of business for
whatever reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a five Oh two law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so he basically went out of
business, but he used to sell these worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That had live worms in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do, there's a nursery down the street
from me and they sell red wigglers,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the three 50 like thing for
20 bucks, which is actually pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: comparable to some online for what I've
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just go there and buy,
you know, 20 bucks or 40 bucks and just
[SPEAKER_01]: put a couple of worms on each plant and
let them do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: How have I never, I've never heard of
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's if you're doing organic,
you have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do like a tease?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you make teas or, um, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I used to do it more, um,
from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, I go to the shows and
people give me tea mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I use booze, Malibu, uh,
compost tea and also the one from extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a really good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, when you're doing this type of
growing, is there any like a balloon
[SPEAKER_02]: booster?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there like an organic balloon booster?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, are you even thinking about any?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of that stuff or is it just like
Dragonflyer Organics makes a balloon,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm always suspicious of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to have to be, I used it in hydro
and we got these with my, my boy DJ DC and
[SPEAKER_01]: we got these like nugs like rocks,
but you couldn't smoke them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were unsmokable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't, they wouldn't combust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I forget, we were using some shit that
was probably outlawed in 14 countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pachlobutazole is the one that I've heard
of.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like a flower hardener that is
popular and can have that effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I've been using, uh, I did a trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I traded my book for some, uh,
fairly large bottles of, uh, mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you don't use very much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see them giving it away to trade show
grab a couple of bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it away to like two ounce bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know if it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really convinced of its efficacy,
but.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do you, how do you prove it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you just have to do a side by side
to really figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't have much time for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to space at the time to be
doing like, I'll just use it if it works
[SPEAKER_01]: great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as long as it doesn't hurt
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, my plants generally are
freaking healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had some spider mites at the
beginning of the year, which was a deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's a big thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I sprayed like three
different types of, uh, miticide or,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, prophylactic, like two or three
different times in rotation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple products then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that, and then I use some
organicides and then I use some,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, green cleaner, I believe it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, those were the three things that I
rotated over about like every,
[SPEAKER_01]: every third day or every second day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can't just spray them every
single day because they, they,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the life cycle of the bug is,
you know, that they, the eggs hang out,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they hatch, then they do whatever it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like three different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of their life cycle and it's a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I discovered these, you know,
pump spray, spray bottles, which are
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also, you know, when you have a
problem, like that, you really have to
[SPEAKER_01]: strip as much foliage off of your plants
as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the least amount of surface
area to cover with the spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the shit grows back and people don't
really, um, it scares them understandably
[SPEAKER_01]: when you strip a plant down to a stick,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of LEDs are using?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are from a company called new tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's N U E T E C K.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, people go to my, uh, YouTube
channel, uh, there's a link in the
[SPEAKER_01]: descriptions of the videos and they can
actually get like a temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're like the strips, uh,
and they can be daisy chained up to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've got three up and two down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and they admit like 25 Watts per lamp,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like cool, cool temperature,
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't get warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they do not have any kind of,
uh, built in fans like a lot of LEDs do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're super flight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they are suspended from the top of
the grow tent by, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant wire, twisty ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you heard of these, Mr. Groot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sorry, I'm dealing with cat issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cat's messing over there, messing up
the audio and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a different kind of LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're the only ones I've seen
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure other people may have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just, like it's a, but it's a
four foot, um, or like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 45 inch long strip with about,
let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got eight lights, eight small
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the whole fixture itself admits by
25 Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and it's got the purple Jupiter kind
of look, but, um, it's the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sold on these lights for vegging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they priced right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I know the pricing and the led
world ranges from super high to a super,
[SPEAKER_02]: super low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't think you can have less
than three of these in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got to send like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I think they, with the discount,
I think they come up to like 125 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thereabouts each, which is not horrible
because you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're never going to replace a bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even if it's a CFL, I mean,
CFLs are 60 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get a, you can get a CFL
fixture from hydrofarm with the ball with
[SPEAKER_01]: all you need, you know, uh, for $60 on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the LEDs twice as much, uh,
it's, but it's cooler temperature wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's, uh, I think the plants
like it more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I haven't really done many clones
under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to give you a disclaimer there,
but I don't see why it would be a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me, uh, what's the biggest yield
you've ever hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many lights were you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, probably like two and a half pounds in
like a three light room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my yields are, are never really,
I'm never really happy with my yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't read that down, you know,
I'm still working on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it's a source of frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we were talking about,
it's really quality over quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I did, I grew a lot of skunk last
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of skunk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do anything like, do you try less
net?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use a trellis net or bamboo stakes
or anything to hold those suckers up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, I did do a, uh,
sort of a trellis netting, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: two runs ago and that was kind of fun,
but I didn't like the, uh, the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was like in a fixed position.
[SPEAKER_01]: It made it hard to water and I like to put
my plants and move around sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't, but I, whether it's
because of my super cropping or just what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm feeding them, feeding them nectar for
the gods, which is a calcium based,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, I've heard of that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, I have not had to use
stakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did when I trellis, I had to use yo-yo
clips from the, I've got like a sort of,
[SPEAKER_02]: those are awesome too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are very super helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw those in a high grow hybrid video.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: He does like deep water culture,
uh, growing does like the yo-yo,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, clips from the ceiling and the trellis
netting and builds his own systems from
[SPEAKER_02]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's where I saw him,
the yo-yo thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was sold as soon as I saw it,
I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a couple of lifetimes in them,
you know, they're not going to last
[SPEAKER_01]: forever, but you can get some use out of
them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me ask you guys, what was your like
biggest fail or biggest catastrophe in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, getting spooked and having to kill
everything and clean the apartment out in
[SPEAKER_01]: about two hours.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the spook?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we thought the landlord was going to
call the cops on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, cause we gave them, yes,
they smelled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we had an apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had two apartments in the same
premises, one basically above the other
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were moving out of one and we
hadn't really completely moved out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they, somebody went in there,
uh, from management without our permission
[SPEAKER_01]: and saw like the bathtub was filled with
empty three part bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and there were nutrients all over the
place and there was like a half trim plant
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guys, these guys were really,
so they were flipping out and the guys who
[SPEAKER_01]: were at the super, they were soul
brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we were very connected to them
and, um, they gave us a heads up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't like, you know, they didn't
get in the way of anything, but they
[SPEAKER_01]: called my partner who literally lived up
in the neighborhood and all of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a heartbreak because these plants,
we had these plants that were just,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were going to be flowery like two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were in DWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some scum number one, a bunch of
shit and it was all, but it had to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It couldn't take a chance.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Better safe than sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we, we cooled off for
a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody's got to start back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: New landlord.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just a little bit more organized,
a little bit tighter, tighter game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as, uh, not as sloppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that building, they had so many
people renting out their apartments for
[SPEAKER_01]: Airbnb to Europeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day there'd be a different foreign
speaking person downstairs trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the weirdest thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Airbnb is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay, if you can go back in time,
and talk to yourself before you started
[SPEAKER_00]: your first grow, what advice would you
give to yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing what you know now, you go back in
time and you tell yourself, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing that comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's the most obvious thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, when I was growing,
it was really, you know, the book I used
[SPEAKER_01]: was this Murphy Stevens guy and you know,
half the illustrations were like pencil
[SPEAKER_01]: drawings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like cartoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it was really very, uh,
there was no grow Bible or a Jorge
[SPEAKER_02]: Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but, um, I mean, Rosenthal's first
book is probably about the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cervantes probably contemporary
contemporary news, but that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that that stayed with you the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, dude, I can't, I was nerds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep shit like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have, um, I've seen one of your
view YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have the very first issue of
