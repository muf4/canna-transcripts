[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get those tomatoes to open up
and to intake CO2, it'll increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and your performance in your plants
like so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It got me nervous wanting to venture into
the organics, but as soon as I did and as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as I found out how simple it was,
it was like, why didn't I do this from the
[SPEAKER_01]: start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's all add another layer of living
soil, sea soil on top of the top dressing
[SPEAKER_01]: so that that top inch is only the living
soil that's kind of drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I see tap roots or some sort of root
formation, I'll transplant them into
[SPEAKER_01]: little half gallon square pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes super simple when you want it
to be simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just dive into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get into the living soil and just start.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 35.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Jeff from Mad
Hatter Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for five years and
he grows plants such as cucumbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: peppers, corn, medicinal varieties,
sunflowers, marigolds, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about his style
of organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to keep things easy in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks a lot about the easy
gardening techniques that he does.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Jeff from Mad
Hatter Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk all about organic
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pretty easy techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a lot of easy techniques when it
comes to organics, and we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of people out there
that watch my channel, tune into this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, that they grow with synthetic
bottle nutrients, and they want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: that transition over to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this conversation here with you
will unravel how easy organics can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that we usually start out with
is, could you just tell us a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about yourself and how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been into gardening from a
young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: My dad had a huge vegetable garden out
back of our property.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just made me get my hands dirty in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started when I was probably four or five
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As time grew, I came out of late teens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started actually going into hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grabbed a general hydroponics grow
bucket with some general organics bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I messed around with some tomato plants,
and they were the most delicious
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic tomatoes I've ever tasted in my
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just intriguing with organics and
growing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dabbled into the medical market and in
the legacy side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had quite a few plants in current
culture, hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a few years of that, and then I
moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved 1,000 kilometres away from where
that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legal market came alive in Canada
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started growing medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually just started using synthetics
like most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Pro-Mix HP, just bottle
nutrients, normal Kalameg, stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got into Fox Farm Ocean Forest,
so it's mostly organic mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen how easy it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seen just, you know, add water,
and the plants just grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grew beautiful, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of did that whole synthetic side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off organic, and then I went
after the nutrients kind of drained out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, I went back into the bottles
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of when I started to see my
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Kalameg issues and pH
toxicities and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just like, man, why am I doing this
to myself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't I just add water the entire
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of looked up a bunch of soil
mixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: My local hydro store has Guy Green
nutrients, so I just threw a bunch of that
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and started messing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm full-blown organics, and it's just
amazingly simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be real easy, for sure,
once you kind of figure things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might take a little bit of research to
begin with, and some people might complain
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're not able to kind of look at a
one-page thing and follow a chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: a feeding chart like you can with bottled
nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you figure out the basics and you
kind of have a general understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, it really can be as simple as just
watering and top dressing, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll get into that a little bit
deeper here in a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you actually have a YouTube channel
too, so you're actually showing off your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden to an audience now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have your YouTube channel up
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: 182 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like you probably have a couple
dozen videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe about six months old or so,
so it's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just trying to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely link it down in the
YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are on YouTube, you can easily
navigate to his channel and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you are on one of the podcast
platforms, search Mad Hatter Organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that'll take you to his channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you just an indoor grower or do you
do outdoor growing or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've dabbled into outdoor growing,
but where I am, it's a very weird climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a late spring, so it goes into
about May 20th is last frost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't get my plants out until May
20th.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then first frost is September 14th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a very short period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can really only grow auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have dabbled into photo periods,
but they just take way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go far into October and they just end
up getting, you know, the humidity spikes
[SPEAKER_01]: because the temps drop so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just end up getting bad bud rots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this year we had horrible,
horrible thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have a bunch of hemp
farms around that just, the aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: the aphids are absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done everything I can and I've kind
of given up on the outdoor stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do grow lots of vegetables outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers,
you know, all the general stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think next year I'll probably be
dabbling into a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're mostly indoors now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about what your current
indoor grow room setup kind of looks like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what size grow room are you in,
lighting, ventilation, so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a little desktop Vigo Sun tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got, it's actually for propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So seedlings and clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a little Spider Farmer SF 300.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little 35 watt unit, perfect for
cloning and seedling for myself at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a little four inch fan in there
to circulate air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a little, a little nightstand
dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a little water ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pop it on top and it just has this
little cool mist that comes out and it
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps humidity perfect in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I run that for a few weeks and
then I have it set up so it's perpetual.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into my two by four Vivo Sun tent
that I have Spider Farmer SF 4000 in that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've dimmed down to about 40, 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I crank it up, it just, the heat just
becomes too much in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a little four inch fan,
exhaust fan that kicks out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got my vents open in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use that as my veg tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lights are staying on from 18 to
six, 18 to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also use auto pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they're done in the seedlings,
I transplant them into the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start the veg off for about a month in
the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they get kicked over to my five
by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right behind me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an eight bar LED, just been
Alibaba one, 651.
[SPEAKER_01]: It produces some light for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got that set up with a six inch
exhaust fan and then another auto pots
[SPEAKER_01]: with the aqua five valves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just basically take them out of the
two by four tent, the pots, and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant them over into the trays into
the five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have everything set up on inkbird
controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have the seedling tent has inkbird
controllers and a heat mat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two by four has both the humidifier or
humidity and temp controllers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're non wifi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have the five by five with the
humidity and temp controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both wifi so I can check them on
my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure that all my temps and humidity
are set perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so my temp controller is set up
on with a exhaust fan to pull out hot air
[SPEAKER_01]: if it gets way too hot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also have a little roll around
oil fed heater that kicks on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm in my basement and I'm in
Southern Alberta where it gets minus 30.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my basement, it gets pretty cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my heater there just in case the
temps do dip down too far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kick on and heat up the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I have my dehumidifier set up on
my inkbird controller or humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the humidity is too high,
it kicks on the dehum and sucks all the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have the humidifier that's,
you know, if it gets too high or it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: too low, then it kicks on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got multiple tents for the
different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one way to keep it easy, you just
mentioned, is you have automation,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to control the
environment's conditions through
[SPEAKER_00]: automation, the inkbird controller,
the heater, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely a way to keep it easy is to
invest in the equipment in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're hands off quite a bit there in
regards to controlling the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you starting from seed or do you
usually do clone?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I start autoflowers from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do do autoflowers, I'm kind of
leaning away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a few years of it, so I'm just kind
of interested in photoperiods now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mostly start from seed with
photoperiods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now I'm doing a 20 seed
phenohunt that I started from seed and I
[SPEAKER_01]: will be transplanted and transplanting
everything over into the 2x4 soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the females, calling off the
males, and then I'll be taking clones and
[SPEAKER_01]: cloning the ponds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you a soil grower, cocoa,
what's in your mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a super cocoa, I like to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Coco Pearl from Psycho.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psychonutrients, I don't know if you're
familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so cocoa core with with perlite
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I add some either guy green
living soil or sea soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll add worm castings and guy
green dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit of a super cocoa mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you adding in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a little bit details about
like kind of your ratio and kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're adding in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what your initial mix kind of consists
of in detail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's what the auto pots are 3.9
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll add about two and a half gallons
of cocoa core, half gallon of worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, and then half gallon of the
living soil or sea soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll mix in the dry amendments on
top of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then you're just following the
instructions for the dry amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: according to what is it guy green?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, whatever tablespoon per gallon
it mentions on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think what did I have it set for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was three tablespoons per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was I mix in the 444 and the 284
for the all purpose in the power bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three tablespoons per gallon for each
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your initial mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're starting out in smaller
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you reckon from Ron,
let me make sure I'm visualizing this
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're starting off in the smaller
containers in your seedling tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're transplanting into
directly into that autopot container that
[SPEAKER_00]: three point whatever a four gallon
container will say for easy it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: under four gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is autopot XL.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you actually do that
transplanting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, like, I start off my seedlings in
Rockwell cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I see tap roots or some sort
of root formation, I'll transplant them
[SPEAKER_01]: into a little half gallon square pots or
solo cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just I'll basically just
transplant those right into like a living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or a sea soil just so they're not
getting too much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they so they're not getting burnt right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, I'll leave them in those solo
cups or half gallons for about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll transplant them into those
pots into the auto pots for gallons and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave them in veg in the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: For about four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they'll deplete kind of their veg
nutrients out of that mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I throw them over into the
five by five flower tent, so I'll veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start my seeds and veg for a total
one and a half months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll kick them over into the
flower tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I do that, I'll top dress,
I'll tea and I'll add microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we'll get into more detail on what
nutrients you're feeding when and the teas
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, what is the water source using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using reverse osmosis distilled
tapped?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you collecting rainwater and bringing
that in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do for for water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for all my outdoor stuff,
I use rainwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a barrel barrel collection system
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was starting to kind of think about kind
of introducing into into the tents as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was also using RO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was running the store every week or so
collecting four big five or five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: jugs of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're costing me two bucks a
jug.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was just getting a little costly and
a little time consuming doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually bought one of those boogie
filters, I think the they're like RV
[SPEAKER_01]: filters for for camping trailers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hook them up to your hose and they get
rid of contaminants that are in the water
[SPEAKER_01]: out of your tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They dechlorinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get rid of a lot of the chloramine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just reduce overall minerals in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of an acceptable level like
like yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have kind of a hard water situation
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running about three hundred and
fifteen PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of want to pull as much as I can
without spending five, six hundred dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: on an RO system for my hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as of right now, I've switched to just
using a filter on the end of a hose and
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling all the minerals out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good thing to remove the
chlorine and chloramine in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's what's known to kill off
the microbes in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's the microbes you want in
a organic system, because that's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working to break down those
amendments and turn them into usable
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good that you're filtering that
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you mentioned the RO system being
very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said, what, three,
four hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you live in a completely different
area than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a five stage one that I have
underneath my sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one ran me about two hundred US.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Canada has a little bit more in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did the math on it and it does turn
out to be good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everybody's different number of
plants you're growing, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can be worth the investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is particularly talking about to
the people who did what you did,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was go to an RO station.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And spend that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my RO station was right down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a dollar seventy five for five
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be very it can add up very
quickly, especially if you're not only
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that water into your medium,
but if you're also filling up humidifiers,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's another thing to kind of calculate
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So RO system is something that I
definitely recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have, you know, use tap water as
long as you're filtering out that
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorine, chlorine, the things that are
going to kill off the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was I'm not against going RO
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it's too time consuming,
too costly for me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually I will get one in the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one last thing to talk about RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people are going to call this
out is it's wasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every gallon of RO water you get,
roughly three gallons is going to go out
[SPEAKER_00]: the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to give a shout out to Doggo the
Hutt for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take your drain line, put it into a bucket
and then use that for your outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really wasting that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just going right back into your
local water municipal system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's if you're actually using that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a tip there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you pH adjusting your water at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it coming out within the range you
want it to be in?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's coming out a little like a
little bit more than I'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also don't adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rely on the microbes to balance balance
that out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust it and have trusted it so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been working and I haven't seen any
sort of pH issues in my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a specific pH range that you
aim for or are you just like hands off as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as don't even monitor it all,
just kind of water it in and kind of let
[SPEAKER_00]: the microbes do that thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: My tap comes out at seven point nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to see it at seven and I'm sure the
microbes will will balance those out to
[SPEAKER_01]: seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talk to us about your watering
strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know using the AutoPot system,
you mentioned that I've used the AutoPot
[SPEAKER_00]: system in the past as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had a conversation offline
about using the AutoPot system and
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just talk to us about the AutoPot
system, kind of how it works in your
[SPEAKER_00]: organic system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the AutoPot system is an automated
watering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't require any electricity or any
sort of motors or anything to pump with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works off of capillary action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a reservoir, a 15 gallon
reservoir that will feed into the trays.
[SPEAKER_01]: The trays or your soil mixture will then
soak it up from the bottom and use that
[SPEAKER_01]: capillary action to water your plants,
water your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: When my nutrients kind of fade out of the
soil, I'll top dress but when I do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also top water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll add a half a gallon or so of water
just so I can get the nutrients kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: soaking down into the soil instead of
getting pulled up from the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, I top dress the teas as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I top dress microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: About every two weeks, I'll shut the
system right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll turn the system right off and I'll
let the soil dry out for a day or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that way I can top water without
having that soil absolutely saturated and
[SPEAKER_01]: drowning the roots out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was doing too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AutoPot system, like you mentioned,
it's hooked up to a reservoir and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming down and it's basically dumping out
water, nutrient mix, whatever you have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the res to the bottom of the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pot and then it's,
like you said, capillary action,
[SPEAKER_00]: which people that don't know that it's
basically just wicking up the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, I found that that
top inch or so still dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem that I ran into in the
past, particularly with top dressing
[SPEAKER_00]: organics, is it didn't maintain that
moisture level and the moisture level
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be there in order for the
microbes to be active and break down those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that are in that top layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I struggled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had like yellowing, like mid flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like week five or so, you know,
four or five flowering on some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did the same exact method that you
did, which is turn off that valve and just
[SPEAKER_00]: let the thing dry out for a couple of days
and then top water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also went in there like daily and I
was spraying the top of the medium in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like on a daily basis, one, sometimes two
times a day, just that top layer,
[SPEAKER_00]: not soaking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes all the way down, but just
doing what I can to try to keep that top
[SPEAKER_00]: layer moist because it is important when
you have an auto watering system there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are so many different auto
watering systems out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them are up top and kind of work
their way down, which might be better,
[SPEAKER_00]: arguably better for organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I run the blue mat system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one that drips down from the top
and I've had no issues with that top layer
[SPEAKER_00]: drying out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, something I thought that was
definitely good that you brought that up
[SPEAKER_00]: and talked about the auto pot system and
organics because of the fact that it can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a little tricky, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be a little tricky, but in the long
run, it is easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more hands off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, kind of like how you were doing is
spraying the top layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of just defeats the whole purpose
of auto watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that ease and reliability of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're having to top water
everything, it's like, what's the point?
[SPEAKER_01]: But kind of the way I kind of got around
that as well with the top dressing is I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: add another layer of living soil,
sea soil, some sort of of media on top of
[SPEAKER_01]: the top dressing so that that top inch is
only the living soil that's kind of drying
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have that layer of top dressing
that will actually be able to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: water absorption.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So barley straw is what I use that helps
keep that layer below the straw below the
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch layer moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use a mulch layer at all or just
kind of what you mentioned there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the living soil kind of layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recently just got in contact with a
brewing company to get some rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably be adding that in for
more aeration and more silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that top mulch layer,
like you said, to try to keep things a
[SPEAKER_01]: little moister up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything for cover crops at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't reuse my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do reuse my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't reuse them in my tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I add them to the gardens in my yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add them to the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add them to the big garden bed for
more like auto flower plants out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I don't use any cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of looking at getting into if I
can find someone with a two by two fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: bed, I'd like to add it to my two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I do end up going that route,
I will start doing cover crops that way
[SPEAKER_01]: because then that soil will just be there
and I won't have to replace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about beneficial like insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any like spring trails,
row beetles, isopods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use worms in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything like that at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor stuff, I use worms in the beds and
not for the veggies.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my tents, I'll use beneficial
Swarovskis and californicas just to
[SPEAKER_01]: protect for IPM measures for spider mites
and thrips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, I try to keep everything as clean
as possible, so I don't need the row of
[SPEAKER_01]: beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing I think a lot of
people get tripped up on, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're starting to learn organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's a requirement.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's a requirement to have
cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's a requirement to have
mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's a requirement to have
worms, beneficial insects, when really
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could argue that that's the better way
to go about it, the more natural way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it for nutrient cycling and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can certainly get away with using
organic inputs without using any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials, mulch layer cover crops,
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you're just relying on the
microbes to break down those amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what you're doing on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, again, I think a lot of people
get tripped up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they must do that in order to
be considered a living organic system or
[SPEAKER_00]: an organic system, whatever you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can get away without it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest things that when
I was starting to get into organics that
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of got me nervous about it was
so much information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to go about
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can do the top dressing way
with the organic blends that you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: or you can do the living soil and have
individual amendments that you put on once
[SPEAKER_00]: in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, rely on worms to create worm
castings, rely on cover crops to do
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that's kind of... It got
me nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wanting to venture into the
organics, but as soon as I did,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as soon as I found out how simple it
was, it was like, why didn't I do this
[SPEAKER_01]: from the start?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Information overload.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally I found out about organic
blends and then kind of went that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into organic blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, the organic inputs,
the organic nutrients that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craig Mifrom are using Gaia Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also use worm castings as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when do you first apply... I know you
mentioned your initial amending of that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now eventually those nutrients are going
to be depleted from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at what point do you apply that first
top dressing and what does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, my first initial amendment mix is
when I go to go transplant them from
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling into the veg tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as they're done in the
veg tent, about week four, so week six
[SPEAKER_01]: from seed, but week four from transplant,
I'll throw them over into the five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: flower tent and I will top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll mix up a mixture of living soil,
Gaia Green 444 and Gaia Green 284 and also
[SPEAKER_01]: add in some worm castings, probably about
two cups of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will scratch the surface up,
get those feeder roots kind of exposed and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll top dress all the dry amendments
on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on top of that top dressing,
like I said before, I'll add a layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil just so that it has that dry
layer kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's as soon as I flip them to
12 by top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's traditional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of people will do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do it either on at the flip or
right before flipping that light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so they have a solid 30,
40 days in veg and then they'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: flip over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people go even longer than that,
but there's so many different ways to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let me ask you this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Gaia Green that you mentioned 284 and
444, you're doing three tablespoons per
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon for each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you apply a second top
dressing at all throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what does that consist of if you
do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I will do the exact same mixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: About four weeks into flower top dressing
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are there any other feedings that
you do after that or is that it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So between the top dressing, so I'll go as
soon as I flip the flower top dress two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks after that, I will add a tea,
a brewed compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then about a week after that,
I'll introduce more microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use this product called microbial
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it has the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that focus on phosphorus breakdown,
similar to like a mammoth P is another
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial inoculant is well known for to
have the microbes in there that focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases the bioavailability of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, yeah, so I'll add microbial mass
and I'll also add, uh, Cytosol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, uh, it's another product for
microbial mass where it's derived from
[SPEAKER_01]: crustaceans, like crab shells and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll add both microbial mass and
Cytosol at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then that's at week three and then
week four, all top dress again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll repeat that process until
pretty much the flower, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually typically it's about eight to
nine weeks and I'll let the, I'll let the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers deplete the soil after that eighth
week there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbes that you're using,
when do you start them and when do you
[SPEAKER_00]: stop them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you also just doing the dosage on the
bottle for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll actually add them right from
seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as soon as I, yeah, as soon as I
dropped seeds into, into the rockwell
[SPEAKER_01]: cubes, I'll, I'll add a couple of drops of
microbial mass, just not, not too
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful, but, uh, it's increased a little
bit of, uh, success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Straight on, on the seeds and clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I'll run that all through
it's every pretty much every two to three
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll run that, uh, with, with adding them
into the auto pots, I will, I will double
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount that I, that's on the bottle
just because I top dress in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll top dress in, sorry, I'll top
water in a liter of water with the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, and then I'll double the amount
and add in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water from the below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it kind of balances each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's back to that bottle
recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you incorporate any sugars
into your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the ones that I believe
I've seen you use in one of your channels
[SPEAKER_00]: before is liquid weight by green planet
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll add that in when I'm doing my
compost teas, uh, just to actually feed
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to give them too much sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'd like them to get the plant or to
get the sugars that are derived from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so yeah, I do add a little bit of that
liquid weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a three, three part sugar
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's mostly molasses really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I'll add that in with my compost
teas as well, just to feed the microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: from the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into the compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know you said you use throughout
the grow or at least in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the compost teas
you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just the aerated compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of tell us like how much
compost you use to how much water and what
[SPEAKER_00]: else you're, you're adding in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I have these little, little mesh
bags there for produce from the grocery
[SPEAKER_01]: stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they, they just have little tiny holes
that I'm just enough so that the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything doesn't fall out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'll take a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add, I compost, I have my own compost
bin, so I add worms to my compost bin as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps break down everything in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just mainly food scraps from,
from dinners and you know, whatever's left
[SPEAKER_01]: over in the, in the, the vegetable bins in
the bottom of the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will add about two cups of that compost
to those bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll also add a cup of worm
castings and a couple teaspoons or
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoons of the guy green power bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really a hundred percent sure if
the power blooms really doing much,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I'm brewing that as well, but I just do
it just, just cause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah, I brew, I'll brew those with,
with an oxygen or a air pump for about 24
[SPEAKER_01]: to 48 hours, just kind of typically what
everyone does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then, yeah, I shut off the autopod
systems for two days and let everything
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll, I'll top water all my
compost season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was that for a five gallon
container, five gallon home Depot bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often once a week or once every other
week or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, once every two weeks, two and a half
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I feel like I'm, I'm kind of
overwatering them with the compost teas,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, um, I'll just take them upstairs and
give them to the house fonts instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it, put it to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you could even sprinkle that in
your backyard, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they'd love it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brew all my approved compost teas for my
lawn and for my vegetables out back and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, put it, put it to good use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one thing I forgot to ask about was
temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think we covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for,
for temperature in your environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for seedlings, I like to keep it around
78, um, Fahrenheit, uh, and then 65 to 70%
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just to try to, I, I, I'm a big
believer in VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the vapor pressure deficit,
it's just, it's proven.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a massive benefit to your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you can get those tomatoes to open
up and to intake CO2, it's, it'll increase
[SPEAKER_01]: your, your growth and your performance of
your plants, like so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's a, it's a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to get everything in that perfect
range, the perfect VPD range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, there's a few charts that are
online that you, that I follow,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, to, to get them in there to,
for the right humidity and temperature at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then seedlings will stay at 65 to 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I go over into the veg tent,
I will stay around 78 to 80 Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'll typically sit around 60 to
65% in veg for a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they had the flower tent,
I'll start off at, uh, at 60% humidity and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll drop to about 52 and to 52% until the
flowers are done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, temps right now, they're a little
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sitting at 85, not too bad,
but, uh, I typically like that 80,
[SPEAKER_01]: 80 degree mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's kind of fall right now,
so it's not too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my house, my, my central area,
my house isn't on and it's not cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: everything down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, getting to that point and I don't
want to add my, my little roll around AC
[SPEAKER_01]: unit because it's just, it's more power,
more noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll let it ride for now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost finished flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, and then yeah, it'll be winter
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the basement will cool everything down
for me that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you do anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: At all in order to prevent pests from
invading your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, I use, uh,
little sachets that I hang off of my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, um, by Copert, uh, or called
Copert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure how you pronounce it,
but, uh, Copert biological systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they hang off your plants and they
introduce surfskis and California kiss to
[SPEAKER_01]: fight off thrips and spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hit by spider mites of probably a
year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really sucked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they came like week four of flower,
week three of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there was nothing I could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't spray anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't really, I couldn't really do
anything other than introduce the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the sachets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they got everything under control,
manageable where they weren't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, completely webbing up all my
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, but right from seedlings,
I use a essential oil sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a company called, um,
cultured and they, they have a bottle of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's called mercenary and it's just
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's peppermint and sesame seed oil
and rosemary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the, all the beneficial oils that
we'll use as suffocants and deterrents for
[SPEAKER_01]: for the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I start that rate from pretty much as
soon as they start showing their true
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves, um, all the way up until about a
week to a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so as soon as they start getting those
little pom-pom hairs on them, that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: I cut them out and then I keep everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep everything as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I'm done with the tent,
everything gets bleach, spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: I sold everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I try to keep clean, clean,
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that helps so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always do a, uh, just kind of a wipe
down of all the equipment, grow tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything before I start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I try to do one between when I flip
the flower, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to do another cleaning of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I am able to remove the tents,
remove the plants out of the tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: I will, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's worth it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, one of the basic things to
do is to avoid going directly from your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor garden to your indoor garden,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you could be, those little critters
could be stuck on your clothing and could
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely invade your indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, this year it was horrible
thrips and horrible aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, I was freaking out for a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I didn't even want to go
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what advice do you have for growers who
are just getting started with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, it's not as hard as you,
as you try to make it, make it seem,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it, it reads so much into
it and you're just overwhelmed with the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of information and the amount of
like, Oh, do I need worms?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do I need this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do I need that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, you don't really, you know,
just have a quick search on, on build a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, build it, you know, build a soil has
amazing soil that that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-amended and pre-built for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, they have these little
mixtures that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, there's little, there's little
packets of, of already premixed,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, brew tea stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, you know, it's, it becomes
super simple when you want it to be
[SPEAKER_01]: simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just dive into it, get into the living
soil and just start, uh, you, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to go crazy on, on rice halls and
cover crops and this and that you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: start off simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's lots of, of mixes that you can
mix up yourself to like the coots mix and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, yeah, like this build a soil stuff
that you can just do all yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, it becomes simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get too, uh, don't get too nervous
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's great advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Instagram, mad
underscore Hatter underscore organics and,

[SPEAKER_01]: What do I have in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just started a discussions kind of
topic on my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just take a, you know, two to five
minute kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I just did one on VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm just going to start with the
basics of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if someone wants to learn the basics
of microbes, I'll, I'll touch on that and
[SPEAKER_01]: do a two to five minute thing on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, if you know the basics of things,
you don't have to dive too deep into it.

overwhelmed.
