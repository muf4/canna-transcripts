[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their waste is then broken down and
mineralized into a plant food that is then
[SPEAKER_01]: the hyper bio available to the plants so
we can run much lower parts per million in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of individual nutrient ranges and
get the same kind of growth results
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's hyper available in the ranges
that the plants need.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more fungi and mycorrhizal fungi you
have increases lignin production in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant so the woodier parts of the plant
also improves terpene expression of
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene variety as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four by four with larger plants I would
say at least a 75 or 90 gallon aquarium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get by with as low as a 55 quart
aquarium as long as it was super heavily
[SPEAKER_01]: stocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more we learn about the soil food web
and you know the different food webs of
[SPEAKER_01]: our planet the more we're improving our
food safety and improving plant production
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast
this episode number 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Steve also
known as PotentPonics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an expert in aquaponics and that's
what we're gonna get into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's gonna talk to us all about the basics
of aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who help make
[SPEAKER_00]: that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over their grow tent which
has a canvas density of 2000 D making them
[SPEAKER_00]: the thickest grow tent on the market
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an aluminum plate that mounts your
controller to the grow tent with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof pass through for cable routing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frame has 50% thicker steel poles and
carries two times more weight than the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coupon code MrGrowIt will get you a
discount on their products and I'll leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link to their website down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Steve from Potent
Ponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey how's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna learn all about aquaponics
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have an extensive knowledge when it
comes to aquaponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself don't have any experience with it
so I think this is gonna be a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting talk here because I'm gonna be
able to pick your brain as somebody with
[SPEAKER_00]: very little knowledge of it so hope you're
prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is gonna help folks not only
doing aquaponics but there is a section
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're gonna really get deep into pH
and so for those folks that aren't growing
[SPEAKER_00]: on aquaponics maybe you're in soil or
cocoa or even a hydroponic system if this
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics talk doesn't really appeal to
you much you might just want to skip over
[SPEAKER_00]: to the pH section at least listen to the
pH section because you're definitely be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to have some takeaways on that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first before we get too deep into
things let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so my name is Steven Reisner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the owner of Potent Ponyx which is an
aquaponics consulting company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We help with everything from lettuce to
medicinal plants to trees to everything in
[SPEAKER_01]: between and yeah I've been working in the
industry for a long time so I originally
[SPEAKER_01]: got started farming and gardening with my
grandparents at a two acre farm and we
[SPEAKER_01]: used to you know they grew up
pre-depression era so we used to make our
[SPEAKER_01]: own pesticides from fermented tomato
leaves and make our own cloning gel from
[SPEAKER_01]: willow shoots and all of our own you know
basically make all of our own stuff which
[SPEAKER_01]: was super cool and then later on moved
into the more commercial side of things
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into certain medicinal plants and
then into vegetable and other production
[SPEAKER_01]: as well and and then later on worked in
out in Colorado and some of the medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plant industries and then switched over to
working in my own company and I've now
[SPEAKER_01]: worked around the world and after Africa
and South America and across the Caribbean
[SPEAKER_01]: across the United States Canada all over
helping build different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics facilities or helping people
especially with specialty crops we did a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of work with fruit trees and some
other heavy feeding crops to try and dial
[SPEAKER_01]: that in and that's been I guess a lot of
my work I guess is a shorter version of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and I originally started working in the
pet trade and then there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: overlap with the pet trade and in certain
types of plants that you grow that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: like to enjoy for recreational purposes
and then eventually from there got into
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics we used to call them river
tanks before there was the word aquaponics
[SPEAKER_01]: and then started working out in Colorado
and then the floods happened out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then ended up getting a job at the
aquaponics source in their research
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory and all that stuff so that was
a really great time managing that and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing all the different research work
there in their lab and then from there
[SPEAKER_01]: they switched owners and we had to they
were interested in having some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: different sectors of the company that I
was heading up research-wise and from
[SPEAKER_01]: there I started my own company and I've
been doing that for gosh I guess seven
[SPEAKER_01]: years now which is kind of hard hard to
believe for me to say that's incredible so
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of experience so your overall style
of gardening I mean you talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics are you are only indoors or do
you also do outdoor growing have you done
[SPEAKER_00]: soil cocoa any like DWC are you organic or
synthetic sure so I've grown pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: every way you can think of I've grown
aeroponics DWC media bed wicking bed sips
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to call it these days
rafts beds vertical beds my personal
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite is dual root zones so I'm a big
fan of splitting up the pots and having
[SPEAKER_01]: the top half of the pot with a layer of
soil separated with a layer of burlap or
[SPEAKER_01]: other root permeable media to keep the
soil above it and then below that
[SPEAKER_01]: immediate so like a clay lecca or a
hydrogen or a lava rock and this allows
[SPEAKER_01]: you to flood and drain the bottom portion
of the pot you're the bottom 40% or so 45%
[SPEAKER_01]: of so the pot and 50% of the pot put a
layer of burlap and the top half be soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and this allows you to top feed the soil
we can amend that you can make a super
[SPEAKER_01]: soil mix and have a nice living soil that
has you know companion plants and the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae and other microbes that come
along with that and diversifying the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial species in the upper portion of
the root zone and then all the aquatic
[SPEAKER_01]: fauna and the bottom portion of the root
zone which is also a huge factor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: health of a typical plant you know that
the biggest way to improve the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity of its roots or I'm sorry the
biggest way to improve the plants immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system is to increase its biodiversity in
the root system so so lots of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: in several different areas when it comes
to gardening so that's pretty cool so
[SPEAKER_00]: let's dive deeper into aquaponics so you
know just starting for beginners tell us
[SPEAKER_01]: what exactly is aquaponics sure so
aquaponics is growing basically with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic hydroponics I guess is the simple
form of it but think think of it but more
[SPEAKER_01]: like aquatic soil is how I prefer to
describe it so you have the the fish which
[SPEAKER_01]: are in living in the system so much a
hydroponic system that has fish living in
[SPEAKER_01]: the reservoir and their waste is then
broken down and mineralized into a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: food that is then hyper bio available to
the plants so we can run much lower parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million in terms of individual
nutrient ranges and get the same kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth results because it's hyper
available in the ranges that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: need and that makes a huge difference in
how well that works for the plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: then we have a huge microbial biodiversity
in that so basically the the fish poops we
[SPEAKER_01]: take that poop we mineralize it the same
way they would composting I guess in soil
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a good equivalent and then
converting it into liquid aquatic soil
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the hyper mineralized water
that's recirculating all the time for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants okay so basically kind of taking a
step back you've got sort of like a fish
[SPEAKER_00]: tank but are the roots is it similar to
like DWC where the roots are actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: the same tank as the fish or do you have a
separate tank for it sure so in general we
[SPEAKER_01]: usually keep the fish away from the plants
there's a lot of fish that will actually
[SPEAKER_01]: eat the roots of the plants koi in
particular love and tilapia both will feed
[SPEAKER_01]: on the roots of the plants so unless you
have a particular reason for that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you want to avoid so
generally we have a separate fish tank
[SPEAKER_01]: that flows into a central sump that is
then going to both the grow bed and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fish tank plumbing was okay let's get
deeper into like the actual equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: that's required for this you can do this
on a home grow level as well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial skill right so I think most of
my audience is home growers so I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to narrow it down to just talking
about home grow however you know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like there is some information there
that is applicable and it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: overlaps with the commercial side of
things when it comes to aquaponics feel
[SPEAKER_00]: free to to talk about that as well but if
you are a home grower and you're ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: start aquaponics what equipment is
required in order to get going sure so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you already have an aquarium at home if
you have a aquarium with a wet dry all you
[SPEAKER_01]: really need to do is get a second overflow
box from your for your aquarium and then
[SPEAKER_01]: hang that on to the side of your over
flood and drain bed and then you can have
[SPEAKER_01]: a flow through that way is a simple way to
do it or you can use a bell siphon as your
[SPEAKER_01]: return or a loop siphon is another simple
way that in low cost way so it's a flood
[SPEAKER_01]: and drain a grow bed and that doesn't fail
you know you don't need a timer or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that's going to fail on you and
those can be great you know super low cost
[SPEAKER_01]: ways especially loop siphons cost you know
the cost of a piece of tubing that's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know three feet long like it is it's not
expensive at all to do and then run that
[SPEAKER_01]: back to a central wet dry so like you
typically use for an aquarium and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just pump from there to wherever or you
know get a tough tote say if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have any of that you can go to
your local aquarium store you can go get
[SPEAKER_01]: an overflow box for your aquarium you can
get a tough tote uses your sump at Home
[SPEAKER_01]: Depot for like 15 bucks and then you could
go over and get a plump flood drain kit
[SPEAKER_01]: from your local hydro store for like
another you know 25 30 bucks hook it all
[SPEAKER_01]: up to a central pump with a tee so the
part of it goes to the fish tank part of
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes to the grow bed you know make sure
you have valves to adjust the flow rate so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get it all set right and dialed in
and then you know away you go it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: anything overly complicated you can easily
plumb them into an existing grow tent in
[SPEAKER_01]: an aquarium you have at your house already
it's nothing you know particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated at all I would suggest going
with loop siphons or bell siphons over
[SPEAKER_01]: timer based systems timer based systems if
you're familiar with them that's fine but
[SPEAKER_01]: the the timers always fail before the
pumps fail so you know it can kill your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants it's not something you want to do
okay so I'm imagining the fish tank right
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm imagining another box really where
you're or another container where the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual plant is located right and you said
it's similar to a sense where I mean using
[SPEAKER_00]: like net pots and a hydroton or anything
up top and then the roots are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: suspended into the the lower section where
the water is are there any like air stones
[SPEAKER_00]: down in that section or is it all just
kind of connected through in the flow
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygenate oxygenate the the water there so
you can do a dual root zone I'm sorry a
[SPEAKER_01]: DWC and you can just put pots with you
know a screen on the bottom of them let
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots go through that works really
well we've had quite a few people doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that or even just a burlap on the bottom
of a pot with some holes cut in the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: to allow it to grow through works really
well the other way to do if you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: existing DWC otherwise just do a flood and
drain in a regular flood and drain bed or
[SPEAKER_01]: you know drip bed it's just fine you know
and you can use with or without media on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom part of the tray as long as you
have it in your pot so generally we use
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon pots or three gallon pots
depending on plant size with the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: half hydrogen or lava rock with burlap and
in the middle and then the top half soil
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so there are several different ways
to kind of set up your equipment and be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful several different techniques on
doing that the thing that helps the most
[SPEAKER_01]: is having that extra soil layer even in
the aquatic type setups is because it
[SPEAKER_01]: increases the lignin production the more
fungi and mycorrhizae fungi you have
[SPEAKER_01]: increases lignin production the plant so
the woodier parts of the plant also
[SPEAKER_01]: improves terpene expression of terpene
variety as well interesting now I gotta
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine that it would probably be best to
have a fish tank first and like learn how
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed fish and have them survive before
you take before you take the next step and
[SPEAKER_00]: hook up your plants to that system is that
right should you at least have basic
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge on you know how to manage a fish
tank I know there's a lot of components to
[SPEAKER_01]: that in itself right you're definitely
better off having at least a knowledge of
[SPEAKER_01]: how an aquarium cycles with the nitrogen
cycling and going you know from ammonia to
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrite to nitrate with the colonization
of the various bacteria that help
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate that but your other minerals
also work on that same way so yeah you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to have at least not have your first
aquarium be your aquaponic system if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can help it but if it is and that's okay
you know I wouldn't say that's something
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're gonna you know fail at if
you've never worked on an aquarium before
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're certainly gonna be better off
you know having an aquarium and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how that works before
getting into hybridized systems I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly can make the learning curve a
little easier but it's definitely nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: that you couldn't learn all at once you
know if you wanted to all right and then
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you make this work in a grove tent
I know it's possible we like I mentioned a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of my viewers are just home growers so
making this work in a grow tent would the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual aquarium kind of be in the grow
tent with it or would you recommend it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be kind of outside the grow tent and
tubing coming into the grow tent with the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or how would that kind of all work
within a grow tent sure yeah so you would
[SPEAKER_01]: just put sit your aquarium next to your
grow tent and run the tubing into there
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe put the sump in the in the in the
grow tent or you could even put the sump
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of the grow tent if you want to
but make sure you have your grow beds in
[SPEAKER_01]: the in the grow tent obviously with the
plumbing or either running in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: having the sump and grow bed in there or
having the sump outside of it and having
[SPEAKER_01]: the plumbing go in and back out of the
tent depending on what's gonna make more
[SPEAKER_01]: sense for your your spot but the easiest
way would just be to throw the tough tote
[SPEAKER_01]: in there set a short you know table in
there or something to keep you know your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow bed height sit your grow beds on
there like two concrete mixing trays or
[SPEAKER_01]: standard three by three grow bed and then
put your plumbing off off of there so
[SPEAKER_01]: either your stand pipe for your flood and
drain or for your loop siphon or your bell
[SPEAKER_01]: siphon depending on what type of setup you
decide to go with and so say say they're
[SPEAKER_00]: in a four by four tent and they want to
run four plants in there what size
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium tank should they get for that
does it need to be like I know some
[SPEAKER_00]: systems out there like auto watering
systems for example like gravity fed to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you have to have it above where the
plants are are there any setups to where
[SPEAKER_00]: that has to be the case or can really it
be kind of on the ground and then you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got a pump kind of flowing everything
through sure so yeah as long as both the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow bed and the fish tank are above the
sump tank you get it doesn't really matter
[SPEAKER_01]: it with a grow bed to fish tank levels
you're not flowing directly from the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: fish tank to the grow bed in most setups
so you can set plummet that way and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will work but I wouldn't recommend it I
think you're far better off having them
[SPEAKER_01]: from a central tee that comes from the
central feed spot so that you have better
[SPEAKER_01]: you know kind of basically two loops going
around one for the fish tank and one for
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow bed works much more efficiently
and then what size tank for the fish sure
[SPEAKER_01]: so I would go for four by four with larger
plants I would say at least a 75 or 90
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon aquarium you could get by with as
low as a 55 gort aquarium as long as it
[SPEAKER_01]: was super heavily stocked but you know
you're really kind of pushing the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: limits of you know there there's not
enough fish weight to make enough biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: and fish poop to feed the plants at that
point you know I mean there's a kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum level of of fish biomass that you
need to have to feed the plants in the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual aquarium you know 75 gallon you've
got the fish in there what else is in that
[SPEAKER_01]: tank sure so we often will put the fish
and then using algae eater or two just to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the thing clean and then we'll have
the the drain in the drain cover you know
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is to keep them from getting
sucked in and then that's all we ever have
[SPEAKER_01]: in there well maybe some air stones or a
heater sometimes depending on the size of
[SPEAKER_00]: the fish tank I was gonna ask I know we're
getting kind of deep into like managing an
[SPEAKER_00]: aquarium but it does wrap into it is there
like a certain water temperature that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be there for the fish we'll get
deeper into like different species of fish
[SPEAKER_00]: here in a few minutes but like water temp
does is there any lighting that needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen over that aquarium tank or what
sure so as far as water temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: generally 68 to 72 is where most of our
facilities are running it for optimal fish
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and plant growth and that seems to
work really well across the board you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're going for cooler weather crops
you could always go with a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler water or you know in the summertime
if you're in an area where it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to cool that water you could
always go with like mizuna or some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other warm weather crops that aren't gonna
care so much okra would be another one
[SPEAKER_00]: that really doesn't care about heat gotcha
and then the water that goes into the tank
[SPEAKER_00]: we talked yesterday where he's actually on
Steve's podcast yesterday and we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: talked a little bit about this fresh water
versus salt water I know it's a new
[SPEAKER_00]: question right but we want to cover it
here so just fresh water go in there or
[SPEAKER_00]: are there some aquaponics setups that have
salt water in there sure so there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely ways that you can profit off of
plants with salt water in aquaponics but
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't work for doing anything as far
as terrestrial plants are concerned
[SPEAKER_01]: outside of brassicas there aren't too many
plants that will grow in a brackish or
[SPEAKER_01]: salt waters type setting in mangrove trees
if you're doing a mangrove tree
[SPEAKER_01]: rehabilitation program maybe that would
work but outside of that there isn't much
[SPEAKER_01]: usage for salt water everything else is
fresh water that we work with there are
[SPEAKER_01]: people that do like abalone and urchins
and kelp and stuff like that in aquaponic
[SPEAKER_01]: systems but you know that's that's more
aquaculture to me I think and then species
[SPEAKER_00]: of fish are there certain fish that kind
of work better than other fish there's
[SPEAKER_01]: some fish that you should avoid sure so I
would avoid anything particularly delicate
[SPEAKER_01]: you know don't do discus or angel fish or
you know freshwater stingrays you know
[SPEAKER_01]: they're they're freshwater shrimps and
stuff they're just too sensitive and as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as fish you can use koi tilapia yellow
perch bluegill all the any of the pan fish
[SPEAKER_01]: are all good stuff for that and then you
know you can do larger tropical fish
[SPEAKER_01]: oscars and red tail catfish things like
that also work so for that 75 gallon tank
[SPEAKER_00]: example for the home grower who has his
tank how many fish should he put in that
[SPEAKER_01]: tank to begin he or she should say sure so
you could do like some larger freshwater
[SPEAKER_01]: South American cichlids you could do you
know a crap ton of guppies or mollies if
[SPEAKER_01]: you wanted to you could do a couple of
oscars or some pacu or you know I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that'd be a good route again you want to
make sure you're still housing the fish
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortably but you're trying to get as
much as you can in there and it's not so
[SPEAKER_01]: much an issue with a lot of people be like
oh well that's too many fish for the
[SPEAKER_01]: aquarium well you have to remember that we
have this huge amount of nitrogen export
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in an aquarium that's just
sitting on the wall there's nothing to
[SPEAKER_01]: export that nitrogen right but in the with
our aquaponic systems you have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are just sucking in all the
nitrogen and all the waste from the fish
[SPEAKER_01]: so you don't have that kind of chemical
imbalance that people kind of associate
[SPEAKER_01]: with smaller aquariums so you can push the
limits quite a bit more than you're
[SPEAKER_00]: typically told you can with an aquarium is
there a way that you can kind of tell are
[SPEAKER_00]: there signals to know like okay I have too
many fish in this tank sure so I would
[SPEAKER_01]: just say if there's a high amount of
aggression in the plant and the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: fish and then if there's a large amount of
issues with high nitrates or nitrites
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going to be another one that's
definitely going to cause issues and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you know again just general cleanliness of
the tank and the system you know if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really gunked up obviously you have too
much but you're going to see that in your
[SPEAKER_01]: water chemistry you know if you're not
again your nitrates are too high you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you definitely have probably if your
ammonia is too high you know ammonia too
[SPEAKER_01]: high would be anything above 0.25 nitrates
would be anything above about 40 or 50
[SPEAKER_01]: parts per million you know would be too
high how do you measure that sure so you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get an aquarium test kit at any pet
store a lot of places will test your water
[SPEAKER_01]: for free if you just bring them some water
samples tells it's your aquarium they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway test it for you for free so you
know yeah and those test kits you know API
[SPEAKER_01]: test kit you can get from aquarium
pharmaceuticals it's been around for you
[SPEAKER_01]: know since the 80s it's a really reliable
test kit and as long as you don't get them
[SPEAKER_01]: too hot or too cold they'll give you
accurate readings it's a tritation test so
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to put so many drops of one and
so many drops of the other in the vial but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's super simple anyone can do it if you
have color now this is an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: thing if you do have color blindness
issues be sure to you know look into as a
[SPEAKER_01]: company called Hanna and Lamote both of
those companies make digital monitors and
[SPEAKER_01]: digital meters that allow for digital
output so you don't have to read a color
[SPEAKER_01]: wheel or color comparison because you know
a lot of people aren't do have color
[SPEAKER_00]: issues okay before we get into pH I want
to dive deeper into that want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: about controlling the water temperature a
little bit more if the temperature is too
[SPEAKER_00]: cool what do you do if the temperature is
too warm what do you do sure so if the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature is too cold we usually fire up
a heater we usually use closed-loop gas
[SPEAKER_01]: heaters or closed-loop solar heaters so
we'll take solar water heaters and put
[SPEAKER_01]: them on a closed-loop heat exchanger and
heat the water that way and then we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement that when the weather is bad
with a closed-loop basically tank less
[SPEAKER_01]: water heater on that same heat exchanger
with a different you know input loop on
[SPEAKER_01]: the glycol and that's the how we manage on
larger systems on smaller systems you
[SPEAKER_01]: would just use a regular you know aquarium
heater or titanium heater depending on the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of your system and then what about
cooling and then as far as a cooling
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a harder problem so usually when we
have big facilities we'll put coils in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground so we'll take big big metal coils
that you like use for gas lines the pecs
[SPEAKER_01]: the yellow pecs line we take the plastic
off of that and bury it and big giant
[SPEAKER_01]: loops and then we run glycol through that
underground or ideally if they have a farm
[SPEAKER_01]: pond or other pond we'll sink it to the
deepest part of the pond and we can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get significantly better heat
exchange it just depends on what we have
[SPEAKER_01]: available to work with but generally
geothermal cooling is their first resort
[SPEAKER_01]: and then if that doesn't work you can go
to chillers but they're generally not
[SPEAKER_01]: financially viable usually try to keep the
room cooler and so we'll have either AC or
[SPEAKER_01]: again geothermal cooling with the tubing
in the ground on bigger facilities to cool
[SPEAKER_01]: them down and then I get a smaller stuff
you can always get a chiller if you wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to but generally you try to prevent it in
other ways preventing some open Sun on the
[SPEAKER_01]: water and the grow beds as much as
possible with plant canopy or shading
[SPEAKER_01]: cloth or you know some of the other things
that you can do to try and help prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those issues cooling is a much
harder problem there's definitely some
[SPEAKER_00]: good advice there though on how to control
that water temperature now pH what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal pH range for aquaponics sure so the
ideal pH range for aquaponics generally is
[SPEAKER_01]: around 6.6 you know that's where you're
gonna get the most amount of mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: bioavailability for your system anything
you know above about 7 you're gonna start
[SPEAKER_01]: to see a cutoff and reduction and then
anything below about 6.2 6.0 you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: see another reduction and then there is
another peak lower on it like 5.7 5.8 but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not not as good across the board for
what we're doing and then with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial species and everything else it's
much better for us to maintain a 6.8 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.6 range for most of the systems that
we're operating right now and then when
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to adjust the pH because it goes
out of range what are you typically using
[SPEAKER_01]: to adjust the pH sure so for aquaponics we
use potassium silicate and we alternate
[SPEAKER_01]: that with a powdered calcium carbonate and
that works really well for raising the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: we can also use calcium chloride if we had
to if you're in hydroponics you can in a
[SPEAKER_01]: pinch you can also use you know a bunch of
other things to raise pH but generally
[SPEAKER_01]: like potassium silicate and calcium
carbonate is the main go-to every once in
[SPEAKER_01]: a while we use potassium bicarbonate we
need to also raise the alkalinity or the
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved carbonate hardness to stabilize
the pH a little bit more we'll add that
[SPEAKER_01]: but in general that's what we use for a pH
up and then for pH down we'll use
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphoric acid for smaller adjustments
and we also need to add some phosphorus to
[SPEAKER_01]: the system and then for bigger adjustments
we just use muriatic acid also called
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrochloric acid which sounds a little
crazy but it's fine when you're diluting
[SPEAKER_00]: it out into thousands of gallons I should
ask this before I asked how to adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is is and you touched on this a little
bit I believe is what would cause the pH
[SPEAKER_00]: to go outside of that range is there
something with that the fish is doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: would cause it to go too high or too low
sure so there's a couple of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things so if your tap water or your base
water when you're adding and topping off
[SPEAKER_01]: the system is high in pH that can raise pH
over time by building up your mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: levels in the system or building up the
alkalinity in the system so that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: one source another source would be you
have if your system is goes anaerobic so
[SPEAKER_01]: say you're feeding the fish too much and
there's lots of fish waste getting past
[SPEAKER_01]: your filtration and into the beds and it's
kind of clogging things up and starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: rot that can also start to raise the
alkalinity and raise the pH of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: and that can be another sign of you know
why your water quality is going south or
[SPEAKER_01]: another thing and this happens I see this
quite heavily in Colorado I think is the
[SPEAKER_01]: place I've seen it most extreme is that
you can have issues with when the water
[SPEAKER_01]: department switches reservoirs so the
springtime or the fall or when frost hits
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever they'll switch from one lake
to another or one reservoir to another and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have as much as a full pH point
difference in 24 hours from your tap water
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be a huge problem if you're
trying to work with anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaculture or even terrestrial plants
even when you're in soil or cocoa having
[SPEAKER_00]: those large pH swings I mean that's
destroying your micro life right that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that people don't talk about
very often is these these large pH swings
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much damage it's actually doing to
the the microbial life so I'm glad you you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that one going back to the pH up
and then we'll go to pH down afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: but pH up you said you use a potassium
silicate or calcium carbonate I watched
[SPEAKER_00]: your video on pH with Chad Westport and
you said it's you had it under wrong to
[SPEAKER_00]: use potassium hydroxide potassium
carbonate and calcium hydroxide why would
[SPEAKER_00]: why are those kind of guys as wrong to use
as pH up sure so you can use calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate I just think it's if you're
going to use it use potassium bicarbonate
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a better for aquaponics
specifically they dissolve carbonate
[SPEAKER_01]: hardness if it gets too low will actually
hinder microbial replication and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: get up to 50 percent slower breeding rates
of your microbes that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: harness to make your plants healthy so
it's kind of a you know it's not it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: a lesser option I guess but with the
hydroxides hydroxides are really easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: accidentally overdose and way overshoot
they're also can't be put on airplanes so
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to use things that are RMD
which is what the the military post office
[SPEAKER_01]: code was for it when I used to work for
them but a long time ago in a different
[SPEAKER_01]: life but anything that goes on a plane or
can't go on a plane I'm not gonna put in
[SPEAKER_01]: my system if I'm gonna eat the vegetables
or consume them those plants in some form
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just to me not a good starter but
it also only adds one useful element when
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else adds to the carbonates add
alkalinity which helps for microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: adds minerals and then you have the
potassium silicate which the potassium is
[SPEAKER_01]: helping and the silica is helping so why
would you add a compound that's only
[SPEAKER_01]: adding one compound that helps the plants
when you get out a compound that adds to
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it just doesn't make any sense to
me you're kind of spending money to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing for half as good of a product
understood and would you say the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for somebody growing in soil or
cocoa or is that specifically for
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics what you just said there well
cocoa I would personally I hate cocoa I
[SPEAKER_01]: think cocoa is finicky plants are just
hard eat it's harder to maintain in cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a lot easier to get pests and bugs
and stuff and I don't know I just I always
[SPEAKER_01]: see like the worst farms of visited
consulting have almost always been cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: so I just I just don't not a fan of cocoa
I'm a big fan of living soil and a big fan
[SPEAKER_01]: of aquaponics either method I think is
kind of the the top tier of the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of terpene levels and other
important essential oil compounds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that were after you know and the
flavor compounds and other things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're all after for a for high quality
organic produce I think that that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: the best way to approach it and both of
them again are why are they the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of those compounds those both of
them are the highest level microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity in the root systems you know
it makes total sense why they're both you
[SPEAKER_01]: know neck and neck in terms of production
of those types of compounds just
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics does it all twice as fast
growth speed wise so you get quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: more you know quite a bit more produce per
year than the normal so pH down referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to the one with Chad Westport the video I
just talked about you have phosphoric acid
[SPEAKER_00]: and ureotic acid which you just mentioned
as a pH down what you would use for it you
[SPEAKER_00]: also have lactic acid bacteria serum
organic listed under right now under wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to cause a little bit of
controversy here because I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people use vinegar citric acid those are
two main ones that people use all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: for pH down and then you also have nitric
acid so why would why are those under
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong sure so nitric acid is the easiest
one I guess to get out of the way first in
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics the fish provide all the
nitrogen I don't need to add more nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: right we have all the nitrogen we need
it's already accounted for we're budging
[SPEAKER_01]: in the fish output into the nutrient
solution and how much they're producing
[SPEAKER_01]: per day so I that's accounted for right so
I don't want to add nitrogen so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that one vinegar first off is a
horribly poor at weak acid it also creates
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of secondary chemistry issues
with polarity and just smells like I love
[SPEAKER_01]: eating vinegar and vinegar chips but a
room with plants in it that has vinegar
[SPEAKER_01]: and it just smells horrible to me so I
think that it's just for your money spent
[SPEAKER_01]: you could buy a much cheaper acid that's
you know much more effective that you
[SPEAKER_01]: could dose a tenth as much to do the same
amount just it's not cost-effective
[SPEAKER_01]: economically citric acid the citric acid
is very weak as well and the same reason
[SPEAKER_01]: you also have a buildup of some of the
compounds in it if you're in a closed-loop
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponic system where we don't dump our
reservoirs except maybe once every maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple percentage points per month we're
taking you know maybe three percent two
[SPEAKER_01]: percent per month is the trickle off
mainly to make sure we never get heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metal issues over time from a water source
unless we have a good filtration system
[SPEAKER_01]: then we don't need to do that but we just
don't want to take the risk with that but
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest thing comes down to is just
cost you know if you're organic certified
[SPEAKER_01]: then yeah okay you're pigeonholed into
doing that and I understand that and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's fine but I most crops as well if
you're already doing aquaponics you can
[SPEAKER_01]: demand a very similar price point to
organic certified without having to deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with all the Rick and Merrill of organic
certification because it's quite expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people don't realize how
expensive it is not to mention the labor
[SPEAKER_01]: cost it takes a lot of labor time to do
all the data entry to maintain your
[SPEAKER_01]: organic certification and you can be
inspected at any time which a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people listening this show or not be
appreciating someone randomly showing up
[SPEAKER_01]: to inspect their facility for one reason
or another so you know all of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: are entailed along with you know whatever
portion of the farm that you dedicate as
[SPEAKER_01]: organic certified production that's the
only thing that you can do there you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize that space for anything else so
and the rules are overly restrictive and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just very few crops demand unless
you're at a really large scale it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: generally worth it to go with organic so I
know that sounds horrible for an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative person to say but you're far
better off just growing organically having
[SPEAKER_01]: a regenerative practices getting some of
the other cheaper certifications and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the same price point as the
organic guys you're gonna get you know
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much the same price anyway why pull
your hair out and deal with the government
[SPEAKER_01]: when you can not do any of that and get
paid the same I just don't see a point so
[SPEAKER_00]: for the pH down lactic acid bacteria serum
phosphoric acid myriotic acid thumbs up
[SPEAKER_00]: not advised to use would be the vinegar
citric acid and nitric acid for aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: would you say the same thing for soil and
soilless mediums yeah if you're mixing a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution all this stuff I would
say pretty much would go the same way I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean yeah if you're in a pinch and you're
out of everything else yeah you could use
[SPEAKER_01]: those like whatever like or if you're in
soil and you need to add nitrogen or cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: need to add nitrogen but you know because
you're low on nitrogen and yeah use nitric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid right because chemically you're
balancing it out for that right so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a matter of using it appropriately
with when thinking about how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing out that total nutrient solution
that you're trying to build up there and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really what it comes down to and
you know I'm a big fan of again the you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned to the lactobacillus acid
lactobacillus acid will lower pH by point
[SPEAKER_01]: one to point two points pH in a one to one
thousand dosage so you know one gallon per
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand gallons lowers it that much it's
decently strong acid compared to most of
[SPEAKER_00]: the others a lot of people really
concerned about using pH up and pH down
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are growing in living soil
for example I know we're kind of getting
[SPEAKER_00]: off topic on the aquaponics thing but I
think this is kind of important for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people to hear is they're afraid that
they're using these and they're killing
[SPEAKER_00]: off their microbes in the medium using pH
up and down are those killing off microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: or or no so all pH up and all pH down will
kill microbes if you use too much of it so
[SPEAKER_01]: the trick is to try and adjust point one
or point two pH in a 24 hour period so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you do it low and slow and you do it over
the course of a week or two microbes don't
[SPEAKER_01]: care the plants aren't going to care your
fish aren't going to care everything is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be fine but if you swing it
quickly you're screwed so what we normally
[SPEAKER_01]: do with pH up or pH down I'll mix it up
into like a five gallon or 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket and we'll sit it on the edge of the
sump with a we drill out a hole in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom and then we'll put a airline will
superglue an airline nipple that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: get for like 75 cents or 90 cents at the
pet store that has a little valve on it
[SPEAKER_01]: and then all you have to do once you have
that glued into the bottom bucket is open
[SPEAKER_01]: it up so it's dripping or a small slow
stream so that pH up is dosing over the
[SPEAKER_01]: course of four to six hours you know and
slowly dosing the water and mixing in so
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not dumping a bunch of it in nuking
everything right there you know it's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a slow adjustment and that's really the
trick to it is you know and if you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have that kind of setup you can always
build something that you know punch a
[SPEAKER_01]: little hole and have it you know you can
time how long it takes to drain it can
[SPEAKER_01]: container right like this is really basic
simple stuff you can scale it to any size
[SPEAKER_01]: system that you're doing and it can be a
really simple way to kind of time release
[SPEAKER_01]: it without having to have it you know I
don't have to go dose it even if you did
[SPEAKER_01]: say I have I need to dose this many
gallons of pH down you can mix that up and
[SPEAKER_01]: then just you know every 30 minutes just
throw a cup in there or whatever you know
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to do it by hand but that's
the trick is doing it slowly last question
[SPEAKER_00]: on pH would be some people swear by the
vinegar and the citric acid you know
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna say that's way better to use
than phosphoric acid or muriotic acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: they say that microbes are safe just want
to reiterate that you're saying that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using enough of it vinegar and
citric acid could certainly negatively
[SPEAKER_01]: impact the microbes oh yeah vinegar is
used all the time as a cleaner like my
[SPEAKER_01]: grandma used to use it as a cleaner like
you make that and some lemon juice and
[SPEAKER_01]: throw you know make the whole kitchen
smell like you know lemon vinegar but you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it'll kill microbes again it's the
concentrations that any of these if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using them a strong concentration of
course they're gonna kill stuff but
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no difference between or you know
vinegar pH down from vinegar and or citric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid in terms of its ability to kill
microbes it's killing microbes because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the shift the the rapid shift in pH not
because of the chemical compound the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical compound of any of these is not
toxic you know you can muriotic acid is
[SPEAKER_01]: using candy it's used phosphoric acid is
in soda right like these aren't these
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't scary compounds right like they're
I think oftentimes people think they hear
[SPEAKER_01]: acid or they hear like you know whatever
mineral because it's in a mineral name and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like well yeah but you use it in your
food all the time like it's calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: carbonate it's a bread leveler right like
it's nothing scary thanks for the
[SPEAKER_00]: clarification there because pH is
certainly one of those hot topics why I
[SPEAKER_01]: think there's a lot of misunderstanding on
it well I think the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: misunderstanding in pH is pH people use
the word pH and alkalinity interchangeably
[SPEAKER_01]: which is completely wrong like I don't
know how that got started but alkalinity
[SPEAKER_01]: is your DKH your dissolved carbonate
hardness which is method measured in two
[SPEAKER_01]: ways other DKH which is dissolved
carbonate hardness units or in parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million so you can measure it either way
usually you want two to five DKH which is
[SPEAKER_01]: thirty six point seven or thirty six point
eight I don't remember exactly parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million to like 80 parts per million plus
minus so that that's your your target
[SPEAKER_01]: range to make sure you're not overshooting
your pH because if you go above those
[SPEAKER_01]: levels I just mentioned you're gonna way
overshoot your pH just by default you know
[SPEAKER_01]: your alkalinity is your stability of your
pH so your higher alkalinity the less
[SPEAKER_01]: likely you are to have a pH shift or pH
change whereas the the short the lower the
[SPEAKER_01]: alkalinity you can have a really low
alkalinity and if you check your pH every
[SPEAKER_01]: day when you come home from work at 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be the same but if you check it at 5
a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: it could shift by two-thirds of a point as
the photosynthetic bacteria wake up or go
[SPEAKER_01]: to sleep and the chemistry starts to
change overnight so you know just depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on you know what water chemistry you have
but you can have pretty severe ones so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you are seeing a bouncing of your pH over
a 24-hour period even without an
[SPEAKER_01]: alkalinity test you can immediately tell
your alkalinity is too low sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a common mistake especially for
beginners that they make their is
[SPEAKER_00]: confusing the two or using them
interchangeably like you mentioned what
[SPEAKER_00]: are some other common mistakes that people
make when trying to grow with aquaponics
[SPEAKER_01]: sure overfeeding I think that's another
one or having like nowhere near enough
[SPEAKER_01]: fish or two way too many fish those are
other ones or people having like tons of
[SPEAKER_01]: gravel in an aquarium where they're trying
to also get the poop to flow out to get to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants you know it's you got to have a
bare bottom aquarium or close to it to
[SPEAKER_01]: have any kind of aquaponics system it
works better not say you can't but it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: work a lot better if you do trying to
think what else people using all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: weird cockamamie stuff for pest control
like people spraying their plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: Windex or oxy clean or like you name it if
it remotely sounds like it might be
[SPEAKER_01]: organic or natural I've had people spray
it on it and then call me and tell me they
[SPEAKER_01]: did it like just because it has a lemon
scent doesn't mean that you should spray
[SPEAKER_01]: it on plants like I don't like there's
just people get all these weird ideas on
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I've had some stories that I can't
mention on here without ruining your
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to monetize this episode and yeah
some pretty ridiculous stuff that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been asked over the years but I think most
of them weirder one we had I think by far
[SPEAKER_01]: the one and I've had this I had like three
calls all within like a year of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: question is like what is the acceptable
level of radon in your uranium in the
[SPEAKER_01]: water that I can use for bore water in
Australia and it was like the same little
[SPEAKER_01]: area that all have like the same idea to
get into aquaponics at the same time in
[SPEAKER_01]: the middle of nowhere Australia and they
had high levels of uranium and and radon
[SPEAKER_01]: in the water and I was like do not use
that water for anything living like no no
[SPEAKER_01]: there is the answer is zero zero is the
acceptable level like oh man that's crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: that is crazy so what advice do you have
for folks that are just starting with
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics sure so I would just say you
know read up a bunch on different YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: channels and things like that make sure
you understand how an aquarium works from
[SPEAKER_01]: a chemistry standpoint planted aquariums
especially can be a really good way to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of better understand the chemistry in
terms of chemical interactions of an
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics system because aquaponics
doesn't have a lot of good because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: approached so heavily from the hydroponic
people and like universal diversities that
[SPEAKER_01]: had hydroponic or aqua or agriculture
programs they didn't really in my opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: approach it originally from the right way
you know they they didn't approach it from
[SPEAKER_01]: the standpoint of again living aquatic
soil you know the that the microbe
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity was as important as the mineral
levels and and trying to max that's why I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that you have such a wonderful
marriage with KNF and aquaponics because
[SPEAKER_01]: it hybridizes so freaking well and allows
us to unlock in some cases 80% more
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals from our fish waste when we start
to add things like liquid IMO and labs to
[SPEAKER_01]: the system we've also noticed that labs
completely eliminates water borne E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli as well as salmonella and a couple of
other pathogens that we've had done some
[SPEAKER_01]: testing on so I think that you're gonna
see you know in five or ten years from now
[SPEAKER_01]: a lactobacillus dosing required for food
safety protocols for any kind of food
[SPEAKER_01]: production aquaponics you know be or even
hydroponics potentially because why would
[SPEAKER_01]: you not add something that accelerates
your plant growth rate and eliminates
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens it's kind of a win-win and it's
low cost I mean you can do a facility of
[SPEAKER_01]: 10,000 square feet for like eight bucks a
week or what you know it's not breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: the bank in any way like it's it's cheap
stuff that's really interesting so yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it's a sustainable approach
that's gonna become more and more popular
[SPEAKER_01]: it was certainly surprising when we were
running the trials with labs we had a non
[SPEAKER_01]: just by happenstance happen to have a non
pathogenic non-human pathogenic E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli strain in there it's a soil E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli there's thousands of different ones
that do different soil functions and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that but it happened to end up in the
system we ended up doing a treatment of it
[SPEAKER_01]: and realized hey it eliminated the E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli isn't that a weird side effect so
then we had another farm a lettuce farm
[SPEAKER_01]: that was a commercial farm that had tested
hot for E.
[SPEAKER_01]: coli in their water we tried it and within
30 days eliminated it from there and we've
[SPEAKER_01]: done two more farms since then that we've
managed to have similar type water
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen issues where the water department
came in more happy with them with their
[SPEAKER_01]: water results and within 30 days we've
been able to mitigate it using you know
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming practices
lactobacillus in particular to eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: those those things so again the more we
learn about you know the the soil food web
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know the the different food webs
of our planet the more we're improving our
[SPEAKER_01]: food safety and improving plant production
at the same time that's incredible yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a big success story there cool
well I appreciate you let me ask you some
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner questions there I'm sure we could
have gone over a lot more really wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: this to be just the basics of aquaponics
you know more like an introduction to it
[SPEAKER_00]: you're the first person on this podcast
that I've ever has ever talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics so I think an introduction to
begin maybe in the future we can do a part
[SPEAKER_00]: two with something more a little bit more
advanced knowledge for the folks that do
[SPEAKER_00]: have experience and maybe then get a
little bit more out of it but I definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: think looking back the pH in particular is
not only going to help people who are in
[SPEAKER_00]: aquaponics but will also help the folks
growing in soil and soil mediums as well
[SPEAKER_00]: so appreciate you sharing that with us
today before we wrap things up tell us how
[SPEAKER_00]: can the listeners find you and what you
have upcoming in the future sure so I have
[SPEAKER_01]: my own podcast as well called the growing
with fishes podcast we're on our sixth
[SPEAKER_01]: year this year we are at almost 300
episodes we're coming up on you can check
[SPEAKER_01]: that out we've interviewed a ridiculous
slew of people we had a Frenchie on twice
[SPEAKER_01]: who since since passed away recently we
had a ton of other activists that are no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer with us and then a whole bunch of
experts from around the world everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: from you know soil scientists genetics
experts to we had a whole 14 hours on
[SPEAKER_01]: plant protections and things like that
after the you know phylo scandal and we
[SPEAKER_01]: really try to cover every aspect of this
industry and there is maybe a slight
[SPEAKER_01]: leaning towards the commercial side of it
is because that is what what I do and most
[SPEAKER_01]: of the panelists do is for a living but we
do cover you know a lot of homegrown stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and it is all geared towards living soil
and aquaponics if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaponics the first 16 episodes are kind
of more of a how-to beginners guide to get
[SPEAKER_01]: started after that we really kind of
assume that hey we gave you the base
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge now we're going to start to get
more complicated and build upon what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been teaching you and then we also have a
Marty and I the co-host of the podcast I
[SPEAKER_01]: have a whole online school a PMJ class
calm you can check that out we have
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients if you need nutrients for your
stuff AP APMJ newts calm and then you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find a podcast on our your favorite
podcast app SoundCloud YouTube iTunes
[SPEAKER_01]: Spotify all the things and then as far as
stuff coming up we have the supernatural
[SPEAKER_01]: conference coming up in July 29th 30th and
31st in Oklahoma City I will be speaking
[SPEAKER_01]: there on IPMO which is advanced IMO
collection specifically for targeting
[SPEAKER_01]: pests and infecting pests with natural
predators so I'm going to be teaching a
[SPEAKER_01]: little seminar on that as well as some
other cool advanced Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies along with Chris Trump
Patrick King Wendy Kornberg Susan
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainwright Evans and a whole bunch of
other awesome organic experts and then all
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Danielle from Aquilitas coming on
the show on the 28th she's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: leading researchers if you're into
learning more about how to hybridize
[SPEAKER_01]: aquaculture waste and inputs with soil
production they utilize that have done
[SPEAKER_01]: lots of testing they've shown that it can
increase THC CBD and other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: important compound expressions essential
oil for compound production by as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: 17% and some of the terpene expressions by
as much as 40% and total crop yield by as
[SPEAKER_01]: much as 53% and this is by utilizing heavy
living soil you know happy good living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and then watering it with just base
filtered water versus aquaculture water so
[SPEAKER_01]: that really does make a huge huge
difference in the chemistry and then on
[SPEAKER_01]: the 12th of May we have Tommy Chung coming
on the show so looking forward to that as
[SPEAKER_00]: well so we had Tommy Chung on the from the
stash podcast with me Rob from CLTV and
[SPEAKER_00]: pigeons 420 and he's got some stories
there he's a he's a talker so I think he's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna I think he'll definitely do well on
your podcast and I was on your podcast not
[SPEAKER_00]: too long ago so I'll definitely have a
link to the episode I did on his channel
[SPEAKER_00]: on his podcast down in the description
section below if you're on YouTube if not
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're on one of the podcast platforms
just search for it on YouTube and it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: come up just search PotentPonics and Mr.
Grow It should pop up first I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely have a link to your channel
your YouTube channel as well down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below and yeah
head on over there give him a follow and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just about it if you enjoyed this
episode click that thumbs up button also
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe to the channel if you haven't
already every single week I'm releasing a
[SPEAKER_00]: new garden talk podcast episode and I
would love for you to tune in to future
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes Steve once again thank you so
much for coming out to the podcast this
[SPEAKER_00]: was very insightful for not only me but I
think a majority of my audience as well so
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks for coming down here and and
dropping those knowledge bombs yeah thanks
[SPEAKER_00]: for having me on your show it's been great
alright until next time take care everyone peace
