[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grud and
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions that I get every once
in a while is how do I earn money from the
[SPEAKER_00]: content that I create?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you that are watching this are
familiar with my content.
[SPEAKER_00]: On my other channel, my main YouTube
channel, I show plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: non-advertiser friendly according to
YouTube and so no ads are displayed on
[SPEAKER_00]: that channel or I think now I think they
changed it so ads can still be displayed
[SPEAKER_00]: but they pocket 100% of the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do I actually earn money from the
content that I create?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well there's a couple ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most common ones is
sponsorships.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every once in a while a company will
reach out to me and they'll mention that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to get their product or service
some exposure and if I feel like that
[SPEAKER_00]: product or service is a good fit for me,
my channel, my audience, then I'll work to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be getting that product in
exchange for the promotion or a paid
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsorship.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're just starting out,
when your channel is small for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really have an audience,
sponsorships really don't come around that
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an alternative to that and something I
want to talk about in today's video is
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliate programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one particular affiliate
program that I want to talk about which is
[SPEAKER_00]: the Happy Hydro affiliate program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off how do affiliate programs
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite simply what you would do is you
would sign up to their affiliate program.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would be able to create custom links
to products that they have on their
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you create content you would
actually provide a link whether it be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description, Instagram,
bio, Facebook, tweeting out the link,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of people create content on
specific items or they'll just show their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and then the products are kind of
shown in the background or they're using
[SPEAKER_00]: the product and then they'll link to that
product so that the viewers, the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are watching it can actually click on
that link and find out more about that
[SPEAKER_00]: product and potentially buy that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if the viewer clicks on the link and
ends up buying that product the affiliate
[SPEAKER_00]: would get a percent commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you sign up to the affiliate
program you create a YouTube video and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trimming your plants then in the
description of the video you link to the
[SPEAKER_00]: trimmers that you used.
[SPEAKER_00]: The viewer then has the capability to
click on that link potentially buy that
[SPEAKER_00]: product and then you get a commission
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know all of you are familiar with
Amazon some of you may not know that they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have an affiliate program as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a part of their affiliate program I do
have Amazon links in the description of my
[SPEAKER_00]: videos and it works the same way as the
Happy Hydro one if somebody were to click
[SPEAKER_00]: on that link buy a product and I would get
a percent commission.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with Amazon they used to have the
commission set to 8% so sell $100 item for
[SPEAKER_00]: example I would get 8% which is $8.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year they actually drastically
reduced what their commission amount is
[SPEAKER_00]: for items in the gardening category.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of being 8% it's now 3% which
is significantly lower than the way it was
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main reasons why I like the
Happy Hydro affiliate program is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's higher than that 3% it's actually
they start at 5% commission for sales
[SPEAKER_00]: through their affiliate program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me linking to Happy Hydro instead of
Amazon I'm earning more money and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: just join the Happy Hydro affiliate
program to earn more money I joined
[SPEAKER_00]: because Happy Hydro has actually been a
company that has been supporting me for
[SPEAKER_00]: three plus years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you have been subscribed to
my channel for a while you may remember
[SPEAKER_00]: back 2017 I think even into 2016 I did
have sponsored videos with Happy Hydro in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been there since the beginning
for me they also support other influencers
[SPEAKER_00]: a ton of influencers here on YouTube
Instagram they send out free products it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a small business that is very focused on
customer service they want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: their customer is satisfied and they also
want to make sure that customer gets the
[SPEAKER_00]: best price.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me personally I would much rather
support a small business like that over
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't actually have any ownership of
Happy Hydro the actually the owner's name
[SPEAKER_00]: is Chris also and some people got confused
in the past they say oh I thought you're
[SPEAKER_00]: the owner of Happy Hydro no that's not the
case I have no ownership of Happy Hydro at
[SPEAKER_00]: all I'm simply part of their affiliate
program but having worked closely with
[SPEAKER_00]: them on different promotions sponsorships
and things like that I can tell you that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is a company I support and I
recommend or else I wouldn't be making
[SPEAKER_00]: this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said for anyone who's
interested in signing up for their
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliate program the sign up process is
pretty easy I'll link you to the sign up
[SPEAKER_00]: page down in the description section below
once you click on that sign up page you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see that you would create an account you
enter in your desired username password
[SPEAKER_00]: then you enter in the password again enter
in your email address there is a spot for
[SPEAKER_00]: company name and website those fields are
optional and then they're going to gather
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of personal information from
you so first name last name phone number
[SPEAKER_00]: field looks like that's optional and then
country you're in the way that they pay
[SPEAKER_00]: out their affiliates is through PayPal so
you're entering your PayPal email there
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some terms and conditions there
you would read through and then check off
[SPEAKER_00]: the box that says I have read understand
and agree to the above terms and
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions there are a couple fields
underneath that user defined fields is
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's titled in the how did you hear
about us section put in mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it that way I get credit for
referring you you can enter in your
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram handle and YouTube handle those
fields are optional but if the owner sees
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have a following on those
platforms they may reach out to you and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially work more closely with you on
either paid sponsorships or send out free
[SPEAKER_00]: items so on and so forth then you would
enter in the security code and then click
[SPEAKER_00]: create my account I'll leave a link to the
sign up page down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below if you have any questions on
the affiliate program whatsoever leave
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the comment section below and if
there's any questions that I can't answer
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have somebody from happy hydro come
on and start replying to comments that's
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much all I wanted to cover in this
video I know there are more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: people starting to create content in this
community and not being able to monetize
[SPEAKER_00]: through YouTube is certainly a barrier so
this affiliate program that I just talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about is an alternate way to try to earn
money for your work I know this
[SPEAKER_00]: information isn't useful for everybody who
subscribed to my channel but I do know
[SPEAKER_00]: that there are some out there that this
information will benefit and of course
[SPEAKER_00]: feel free to share this video if you know
of anybody who this information would help
[SPEAKER_00]: click that thumbs up button if you haven't
already and I'll leave it at that thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you so much for watching and until next
time pace
