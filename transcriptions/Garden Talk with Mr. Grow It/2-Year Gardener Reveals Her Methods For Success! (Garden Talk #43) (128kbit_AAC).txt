[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stress the plan out just to
understand that particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stress you out to your next to see
what happens if I don't give you air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't have no airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your temperature is too hot,
if your temperature is too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a bucket from home and I go and I
get the dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the whole boxes of them and I just
mix them together in a trash bag really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized I didn't build it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was putting too much water in the
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use tree stump for my, people use
recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use tree stump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use tree stump and some molasses
water together and some banana pills that
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave sitting in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put all of them in the water overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening, it taught me to be okay with
failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It taught me to embrace failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?

[SPEAKER_00]: Hello and we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Jerria Black.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been in contact for I
don't even know how long it's been close
[SPEAKER_00]: to a year or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been doing a lot of things with
CL Media and you've got your YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're going to get into all that
and then we're going to get into your
[SPEAKER_00]: style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what you do in order to be
successful in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really this Garden Talk podcast is about
identifying different practices that
[SPEAKER_00]: people do in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then people that are listening can
take some of those best practices and
[SPEAKER_00]: implement in their garden potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to learn all about your style
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're big into DIY.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're very, very hands on building
things, aeroponic cloners, flood drain
[SPEAKER_00]: trays, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to get into all of that on this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, as always, can you give us an
introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm Jerria Black.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live out in the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been gardening for about two years,
about two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in basically around the plant
for about plants or anything gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: wise around about six years now,
six or seven years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did I get into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into gardening basically just from
gardening to help my mom.
Basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom is a recovering, you know,
I got the record story like everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was spending a lot of money and I
figured why not grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also started growing it because
I cook with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to see money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went down the rabbit hole basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started researching, started reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first I thought, and I'm not going to
lie, I thought that I was going to put,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, I thought I was going to put like
some seeds or some dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how you go to Home Depot and
somewhere you just grab a pack of seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was going to put some seeds in
the dirt, put some water on it and go
[SPEAKER_01]: about my business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I really didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went into Home Depot, you thought,
you couldn't, how many?
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought like a bag of dirt, you know,
bigger bag of dirt for seven bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some little pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my little lights I got from Amazon
for like 50 bucks a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: My little tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once I started, I realized that
growing plants is more complicated than
[SPEAKER_01]: just throwing it in the dirt and putting
some water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're growing aloe, then that's
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I realized it was more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was just starting to read more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm like anyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to not know something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to be in a room with someone
looking at something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, for example, everybody was
throwing a VPD around a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I didn't know what that was,
we Googled and we read and I want to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing with, you know, beginning
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't figure out why certain things
happened to my dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I researched that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't figure out why my leaves were
looking, my plants looking crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I researched that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as time was going along,
I started learning about different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm Googling and researching,
I'm coming across people like you,
[SPEAKER_01]: the guys over at CIO Media, Goblin,
Doggo, Vader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm coming across all these people
and I realized this is a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is like really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I just started watching and,
you know, like the blue pool of the red
[SPEAKER_01]: pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue pool of the red pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one do you take?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I took a half of each.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fast forward to two years later and now
I am a organic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every couple of days or every month or
every cycle or anything, I try to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I'm at with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it hookanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it KNF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call it organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: My style is hookanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hookanics is basically we're going to
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've gotten to the point where
you've got a YouTube channel and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: showcasing not only your GROW,
I've seen your GROW on your YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, but you also have kind of a
shows, I guess you can call it Canisys
[SPEAKER_00]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Phone a Friend show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us a little bit about your
YouTube channel and kind of what you got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I was researching, and I love some
of you guys, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was two things I realized in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why didn't nobody look like me?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I researched, I couldn't find
anybody that looked like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even when people ask me how do I pick
out my lights, one of the sets of lights I
[SPEAKER_01]: have is photon type lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how I picked those lights out was
because it was a young lady doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstration on the video.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I picked them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was basically I researched and got
all the specs and information from like
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in different rooms, talking to
different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went to each company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each company had a guy, you know,
doing their whole demonstration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And photon tech had a female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she broke it down and it made perfect
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was relatable to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought that was dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that there's not a lot of
females in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, I was like,
this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how is it not that we don't have any
females in this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're the most nurturing people on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We nurture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like I said, there was no people
that looked like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided one day, I'm gonna make a
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I started it,
but I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happened to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started saying, sure, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl power, you know, it's the year of the
girl power.
[SPEAKER_01]: Girl power, I got you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I realized that I wanted to bring light
to females in certain businesses and just
[SPEAKER_01]: tell the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the story is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you fast forward,
I realized that I wasn't talking to no
[SPEAKER_01]: guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was leaving the guys out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do what they call the
algorithm or the data, I realized that
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the people that watched me were
men.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just like, oh snap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I forgot all about the guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I keep forgetting that it's beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guys are beginner growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in the gardening field,
it seemed like it was men growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ain't never pictured in my head that
men are beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that I was leaving men out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me try, you know, doing a separate
show where I can talk to my big grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I didn't want to just talk to y
'all about gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can watch you all day about
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I want people to get to know like y
'all have other sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: As women on Kansas, we talk about mental
health, mental stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about skin care.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about, you know, anything that
women need to talk about, we talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody's doing that for a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Chris, you have stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have everyday stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started to figure out that I wanted
to talk about mental stress for men.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do men deal with mental stress?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do men deal with being a dad with
gardening for medicinal purposes?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do men use gardening in their everyday
life to help them with mental stress and
[SPEAKER_01]: PSDs and, you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them, like I say, women are not in
the military, but most men are in the
[SPEAKER_01]: military.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one's really talking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just feel like I need to show for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do your skin care?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's your snacks?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your diet?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you are a person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just not just, oh, this is a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's not how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the big row show because it was
like, all right, I want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I want to talk about something in the
industry that will help men that's in that
[SPEAKER_01]: field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also want to get like a little
personal to let men know that here on Big
[SPEAKER_01]: Row, we have a comfortable space for men
for you to, you know, in lack of better
[SPEAKER_01]: terms, let your hair down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This space is designed for you and mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can relax, hang out, and don't feel
judged or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, in the men culture,
like, Chris, in your household,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're married and let's just say the
bills are not paid, they're not looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your house, they're looking at you or a
lot of stuff falls on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, they support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how I had the big bro show.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was part of one of your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody's interested in watching
that one, just search, I got bleach tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's call Mr. Grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk all about lighting and we get a
little personal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you and actually get a
little personal in that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely link that video in the
description section below for those
[SPEAKER_00]: watching on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out that video on her
channel, let's dive into the grow side of
[SPEAKER_00]: things now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of already talked a little bit
about your grow style, hood gannics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but can you tell us, you know,
are you an indoor grower, outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil, cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: You were synthetic and now you're organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your kind of overall grow style?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started, it was,
um, organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was nectar of the gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was still bottled up with nectar of the
gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so imagine that a nectar of the gods
with bags, sorry, from, um, Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it got pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I switched over from bags from bottles
because I went from, so let me go back.
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the bottle soils of nectar or the
guys, it starts off with a baseline of
[SPEAKER_01]: four bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, because I was new, it seems
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk into the stores and you
purchase it, they give you a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like self-explanatory and they give
you how much to put in per gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have levels to it where they
have the base six events and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: pro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason why I liked, I like nectar
of the gods, cause now past tense,
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't currently use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a plug and play system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're into like science or you're
into wanting to see what your plants can
[SPEAKER_01]: do or any kind of growth style with your
vegetables, anything you want to see what
[SPEAKER_01]: they do and just trying to play with it
first to understand your, to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for me, nectar of the gods was good
because, um, and allow me to take each
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle to see exactly what that bottle
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy for me to watch you and you be
like, yeah, well you use bloom and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure your peppers grow extra big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that sounds good, but how big,
how do I know how big pepper is supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to get in the first place?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would grow a pepper out and just see
what it would look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and then the next one I would use
the bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just plug the bloom in,
plug it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted it, it would show me what the
pepper would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, oh, this is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'll be like, oh, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not using it in my next, in my next
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so as a plug and play system,
um, it also allows you, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: to research for every, any item that
you're growing and know the particular
[SPEAKER_01]: information about that plant and then
figure out what stuff you want to use for
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what will work better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, once you dive into that,
that philosophy, you get to 18 bottles and
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's like becomes, you know,
a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for me, that was, it is too,
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want, um, the best, but I want it to be
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of tasks that I do throughout
the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time for 18 models.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started researching about,
um, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came across, um, try amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's Dr. Urge is what I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Urge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the dopest part about that,
you can cut the boxes up and put it right
[SPEAKER_01]: in your dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I have that and then I,
my next thing after that, I researched
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and then once I started researching
soil, I realized I can buy different bags
[SPEAKER_01]: of soil or I can build my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned to build my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my, my, I built my own soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I use pro mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, um, worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, uh, lake water is called.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just water lakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty expensive, but it's great
because it just use up the water has all
[SPEAKER_01]: like slight already slight amendments in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can use it and mix it with your pro
mix and make your pro mix such longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I use some other stuff that I
get from other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, maybe if I decide like this cycle,
I'm going to go and build this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, you know, amendments that you
could put in to ream in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this cycle, I'm deciding to go a bit of
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I really, and then the best part
about it is, is that, uh, I get to keep on
[SPEAKER_01]: my dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to keep all my dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was so dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't keep on my dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you go from bags,
well, it's a kind of mixing your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the ratio you're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got pro mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do like the 33, 33,
33.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you like 33 organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: I took the whole bag of whole mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took all my dry mint, all my food and
all my stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I took a whole big bag of,
um, one catches all the trash can and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, my dry amendments, all the trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started up and I'm at water to it
started up at maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I use tree stump for my, um,
if you would use recharge, I use tree
[SPEAKER_01]: stump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use tree stump and someone lashes
water together and some banana pills that
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves it in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it all in the water overnight and
you know, um, but the air bubbles,
[SPEAKER_01]: I irrigate it overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, um, um, put it in the dirt and
then need a dirt for a couple of days and
[SPEAKER_01]: call it cooking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't cook my dirt cause it don't get
hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll call it cooking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I use it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have any ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you, um, 33, 42,
12.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know it works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's organics, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that title.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title, how to grow organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I don't, I don't measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't start measuring until it's time to
like feed or time to use pH or like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, stuff like chemicals,
but when it came to me first making my
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't measure anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was just like, this looks like
about enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where the guy's like, it was like that
sprinkle, that looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well let's back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just get into your grow set up
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size grow tents are you in and then
what are you using for lighting and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you talk about your grow room set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grow in the basement while I'm
currently out with my basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one, two, three, five tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, everything's all tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a eight by eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a two by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a two by four and I have two,
two four by fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have one, two, I have two X
infinity, X infinity in tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, I know people in his code down
here look in his description.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I had two, um, I have two,
um, X infinity, I had a smaller version
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I had the, um, four by four and
then in Beale's tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my tents are in Beale's tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is an eight by eight and then a
two by four and then, um, another four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and my two by four, I have HLG
three hundreds and my, um, two by two from
[SPEAKER_01]: AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, uh, a Beale's sun 1000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and my eight by eight, I have the HLG,
um, six hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have two of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one, and then in my other four by
four, I have four, uh, four photons X six
[SPEAKER_01]: hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and, um, my other four by four,
I just installed the, um, spider farmers S
[SPEAKER_01]: E 5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have those and I just installed those
maybe a week ago in those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So multiple tents, multiple lights,
really good lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you named off a lot of good
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I changed them to $600 spec.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically for a five by five veg,
I'm sorry, five by five flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: six by six veg, 2.6 microns per joule
system efficacy over 1500 PPF,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the best diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people would say Samsung LM
three Oh one H in Ventronics driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You named off a bunch of good lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool that you've actually
gotten to the point now where you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned you started off small and
kind of worked your way up into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these things that you didn't start out
with HLD six on a red light before and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a gradual transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I used a little figure I like
from, um, Amazon, like they blur pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them blur pools.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they use a little blur pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, I did not start off that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off with those and I just
transitioned as the research, as I started
[SPEAKER_01]: researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you typically starting from seed or
do, do clones or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I typically, I don't use.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else's clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you will never see anyone's clones from
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, am I into my grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm not against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you choose to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, um, all the horror stories is
good enough for me to learn from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know how other people cater to
their plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they started to feed
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they did to get the
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how they cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I choose not to go with clones,
but I do use clones because I call my own
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm about saving money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch me, you know that I'm about
saving money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, colonization money, especially on
genetics that you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I typically, you see, it's funny
because, um, I got into cloning because,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, everything in growing, I want those
people to be lucky to not have no problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I haven't had not an issue with
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have issues and blood rotting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had any of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I haven't had like, um, bugs or any
of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the biggest issue I have in growing,
my biggest downfall is germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not know why I've killed so many
seeds, but my biggest problem has always
[SPEAKER_01]: been germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, I start from seed cause I'm
going to get down pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, so seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I cloned because I need to save
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to save time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that because I have germination
issues that you better call because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not going, you may not get nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, oftentimes a lot of people don't
know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, one reason why I struggle
sometimes when it comes to germination is
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature of the medium,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too low, like you're in a
basement, you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the temperature is just too low and
it's not able to kind of sprout from the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium just because the medium is not in
the proper range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle with that myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to be extra careful that my medium
is in the proper temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people overlook that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even really think of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to look into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I looked at your channel,
I saw you have, you know, you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: DIY.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually created your own aeroponic
setup for cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us like how you built
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the machines cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they cost a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just was not paying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just felt like this doesn't make any
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I go on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm researching, like, all these
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was teaching you how to make these
miniature versions of it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one that I wanted costs $190,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to recreate that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went online and I think I came across
Goblin or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Doggo was doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of people were doing different
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just took some notes and I decided to
do my own version of it and a really
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger version of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because I wanted...
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I wanted more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to Home Depot and I got,
um, seven Goblin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I'm sorry, 14 Goblin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven Goblin and 14 Goblin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just regular tubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones you would, you know, store your
Christmas lights in or the ones you would
[SPEAKER_01]: send to college with your kids or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got me, I'm going to say correctly,
a saw bit, which is, I call it the circle
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a circle, but it's a saw bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like six bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tubs were like $11.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a coupon too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was couponing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I went to my local hydroponics store
and I'm like, I was like, oh, this says
[SPEAKER_01]: air for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: This should work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought two of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like, I had some points
because I shopped at the local hydroponics
[SPEAKER_01]: store a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those were free for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been like $14 a piece or
something, but they were free because I
[SPEAKER_01]: had points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I proceeded to go home
thinking that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I forgot the tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't realize that I needed a certain
kind of tubing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I had to go back to that little
Walmart, got the tubing and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the tubing is from my, for a fish
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically for a fish tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that cleans, you know, cleans the,
the tank out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I needed some air, air stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got those from Walmart, uh, for a fish
tank, $4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I got all these things together
and I didn't know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was just like, well, Jay,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, why do you just have all these
pieces?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I sat down and just mapped it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, so we're going to pull,
I just turned it, turned it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, each square is going to be a
hole, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm putting the holes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'm like, well, how does a clone,
I forgot to get the cloning thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to go back to the hydroponics
store and get the hockey pucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call them hockey pucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys might call them something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you give them some hook
gettings?
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them hockey pucks because that's
what I can remember about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and they're pink.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I got hockey pucks and I made sure
the hockey pucks and the circle drill
[SPEAKER_01]: piece fit together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just proceeded to, to drill the
holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized, okay, at first,
my first go run out, I built the water up
[SPEAKER_01]: too hard, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, this doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that I didn't build it
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was putting too much water in the,
um, in the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I had the research on how to clone
properly, which now turns into deep water
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, which I really kind of didn't
even put two to two together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, I'm doing deep water,
hydroponics, here I come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I realized I was putting too much
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I want the bubbles to,
you want the bubbles to pretty much bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: up, hit the bottom of the, um,
of the stems enough to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: moisten it and make the roots stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I put some great white shark
in the water, stir it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about the difference between my
do-it-yourself corner and the ones that
[SPEAKER_01]: you purchase, it might take a little bit
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it takes about 14 days total and get
really beasty and my cloning get really
[SPEAKER_01]: beasty ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the dope thing about this people is
you don't have to buy a cloner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to make one because if you
just use water in a cup and change out the
[SPEAKER_01]: water every single day, you'll get the
same results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just that it's a cup and you can
put one into, um, you know, plants in a
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, with the do-it-yourself, with the
cloners, you can have multiples and it
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like helps irrigate a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way you don't have to change the
water every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I like to save money and save
time and I'm going to forget that I
[SPEAKER_01]: changed the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got other problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the cloner machine was great
because I didn't have to change the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can clone without a cloner or
do-it-yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought up that cup of water
and just sticking in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that recently and I got nervous
because the clones started showing like
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies and I wasn't changing out the
water every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was told that you should like
people do, but you don't have to like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can keep the same water for like 14
days and then it will root, but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed my, for me, I changed it every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed a cup of water every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made sure that my stem was cutting the
angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, every day I just made sure I
pHed the water and I just had a bucket of
[SPEAKER_01]: water that already pHed to whatever and,
and, um, make sure it was a lid and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every day I would just change the
water out, change the water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I left the cups inside the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't need the same cycle of lights or
whatever, um, as a veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't have any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, in my experience, um, changing the
water every day was very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause when I didn't, it didn't,
the roots didn't sprout or they died or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the case can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, changing the water every day
just worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to change out the water every
day next time, but a big difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between the cup of water versus the
aeroponic method that you built,
[SPEAKER_00]: the DIY aeroponic setup, you're going to
get much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be getting much faster roots with
aeroponic setup, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause of the aeration you've also got,
um, like you said, I think you sprinkled
[SPEAKER_00]: gray white in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must be getting roots as early as
five days, roughly maybe seven days max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In between seven to, I wonder,
I saw people just want to say stop 14
[SPEAKER_01]: days, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I went right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I say 14 days, but for me, um,
if you go, like you said, like five to
[SPEAKER_01]: seven days, and if you see the video of
the cloning machine, I did that was a week
[SPEAKER_01]: later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was maybe like, so,
and they're like, they're coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they are like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to put them in dirt quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like they're beast and really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and they're strong roots and are
beautiful to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, about five to seven days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I say 14, just in case you do
something wrong or didn't use great white
[SPEAKER_01]: or didn't your water not pHed or there's
other things in that that can contribute
[SPEAKER_01]: to why your roots are not coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you didn't pH the water or maybe
something fell in your water or maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't sanitize your bucket enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause you got to realize that is do it
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want none of the particles
that you saw then or none of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: in your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to scrub that water out and we
scrubbed that bucket out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wouldn't make sure none of those
any cause that can affect how your roots
[SPEAKER_01]: going to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it won't affect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think it would, but it would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more question, which is the pH of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you monitor the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a blue lab pH pen,
but what pH do you aim for in your
[SPEAKER_00]: aeroponic cloner?
[SPEAKER_01]: I aim for a 6.2, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then did you do like a PPM or EC as
well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any type of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get PPMs a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no too much math.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, too much math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's too much information to keep up
with for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the PPMs is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I research it to understand how PPMs work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have my set up to in case I need to
do a run off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, like I said, I haven't had
any, I haven't come across any issues yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have things in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like I said, I'll watch you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to watch people in your problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very proactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want problems, but I do set myself
up in my growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my growth is set up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a problem does arise, I'm already set
up for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, for example, um, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to actually ask you about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, what type of water do
you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use RO, tap, well water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about your flood and drain tray
DIY setup that you did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm lucky my tap water doesn't come out
to high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people, um, it relatively stays
like at a 7.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, um, during the winter to summer
transition right now, for the next 30
[SPEAKER_01]: days, it will jump up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got to watch it a little bit and then
it'll go back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally when you straight out of my
tap is a seven, like strapped to tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't really have like,
it'll adjust itself once I put the water
[SPEAKER_01]: in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I still check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my flood and drain system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Vader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the courtesy information and
courtesy of better people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, and I'm lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a game we're not going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to keep bending over my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so I, I was like, Oh, my plants off
the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a basement now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I started learning how to grow an
indoor garden upstairs in my home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my home, I have carpet, you know,
in the room or whatever, as my knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: is expanding, my growth is expanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up moving into my basement,
but my basement is concrete floors like
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone else's basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was colder on the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I wanted to get my plants off the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so I started off with building
the tables and I were going to order the
[SPEAKER_01]: tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, they wanted $600 a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not paying you $600 a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the price in my, I'm not doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, uh, learned to build tables from
watching Vader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that video said, you know,
the trick in that video is you need two
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on my video is just me on Vader's
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a right follow later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, it was a third of the cost of
building the tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I built two tables and then I came
across, uh, dog dog was building a drug
[SPEAKER_01]: training system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, the only thing I didn't like
about his training system was his,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, his pumping the way he was pumping
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to go back and research on how I
wanted my punch to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no one had it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like no one had like a system at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so on my flat tables and you should
just saw me, Chris, wait, this is why I
[SPEAKER_01]: need my hook in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So such a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not measure the tables, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did the tables in my tent already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course you have to buy the flood
drain stuff, like the drain tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never measured the drain table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get to the hydroponics store and I'm
like, yeah, that looks like it'll fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get two of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when, and my eyesight, so ladies make
sure you either learn how to take
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements or get you to Google measure
on your phone lesson learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned to measure things out now.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I buy these tables thinking
that they were going to fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I got home, these tables was twice
the size of the table that I built.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in my mind, I, by the way,
were the flood things were the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were humongous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they were so big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were like big built for like a 10 by
10 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to go back and, um, get the
smaller versions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to figure out where I'm
going to put the pump that like some
[SPEAKER_01]: people have a trash can to pump the water
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to
pump the water out.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Limited space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I wanted to be more convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember making the, uh, the cloning
machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was just like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to Home Depot we go and I go get the
tubs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have 14 gallon tubs under my
tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I got to figure out where I'm
going to put the tube in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm such a girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like not measuring nothing out again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look and at the bottom of your flag,
people, if you look at your draining
[SPEAKER_01]: tables, you have these little circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably would never pay attention to
it, but it's these little circles on both
[SPEAKER_01]: sides, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In front of the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so on your drain table should say
like two feet, three feet, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should have numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right above that is these two old
circles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I joked the holes in those
circles, put the tubes there, and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: use epoxy to fill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got that idea from some guy that was
building, uh, a water fountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was building a water fountain and,
uh, he just had his little $7 pump thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, water go in, water go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how he explained it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he said it, I was like,
that's how I'm seeing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go back to the store for five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get water go in, water go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'll box it and it fit right into
the little hole that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, you plug it up into the,
uh, air, what you call it, the stone,
[SPEAKER_01]: the air pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the air pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used the air pumps again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, I had some points,
free air pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I plug in, you know, all the
tubing and stuff that I got from Home
[SPEAKER_01]: Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just have to figure out about your
air pumps, what size tubes you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I put a going in system and going
out system, going into, going out to,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and I played with that for a while,
filled it up, see I went up, see I went
[SPEAKER_01]: down and it happened to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the problem with that was,
Chris, was in order to water the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would physically have to go downstairs
and plug the pump up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd have to keep the purpose of me
building this whole table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that was dumb, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I went to myself, Jay, that is so
stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got to go downstairs and plug it in
just to, what did you build the tables
[SPEAKER_01]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just hand water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I sat back and I realized,
um, I didn't know what I was going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the Neweah hub, the Neweah grow hub,
and I just didn't work well for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I didn't know what I was going to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had the ring door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bell and I'm sitting in my house and the
ring door balls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's at your front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone's at your front door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come up with my camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, dang, I wonder if they got any
products like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to Best Buy and they had these
little plugs, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These little like a plug that's good for
Alexa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good for, uh, any programs you
have, like for your housing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I proceeded to plug the, um,
the pumps and signals, downloaded it to my
[SPEAKER_01]: phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, God, I hope this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it turns on for an hour and I can
leave the water on as long as I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, a program, how many times a day I
wanted to come on, depending on where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: at in the veg or the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, it, it waters itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I have to do is,
uh, once a week, make sure the water at
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom in the reservoirs are pHed
correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm cleaning them out and they are full.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went from watering like every day,
my hand watering every day to just check
[SPEAKER_01]: it on water once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes things so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a auto watering system myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been using those, the blue mat
carrots and hooked up to a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as it's above kind of the grill
pot has the, you know, come down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll automatically drop down as the
medium dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the auto pot systems in the past
where it's basically same thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes to the bottom of the grill pot and
it's like bottom feeding and it wicks its
[SPEAKER_00]: way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those things save so much time,
you know, it's like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: like hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be, it can be time consuming and
depending on your grow setup, like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're, if you need to like get back into
your grow tent, because you've got other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in front, like then you get to move
plants out of the tent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: lean into your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it can be a lot easier to have an
auto watering system set up at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be blue mats, auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flood and drain trays, you know,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty cool that you actually got
to that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're probably saving a ton of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am because normally I was in my gardens
for like 13 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It felt like now between me switching my
soil over to organics and then me also
[SPEAKER_01]: doing automatic watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a lazy gardener Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so lazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a fine new project now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be bored.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be just messing with the plants for no
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how you got, I had to,
you know, go back to the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to keep myself, keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if I don't, I'm going to just mess
it around and mess the plants up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cause I'm getting everything to do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, now I just take on new projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow some spring things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned in the beginning,
how you kind of throw together your mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil mix, you have amendments in it
to begin, but how about later on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what nutrients are you using and when
are you actually like feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm assuming that you said you're
organic now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm assuming you're doing some sort of
like top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I top dress, I use, um, it's Dr. Urch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I use those and, um, their whole line
is to me, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a little smelly, but it's pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, like I said, uh, hookings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a bucket, uh, from Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's my favorite store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I take a bucket from Home Depot to
paint bucket and I go and I get them dry
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments from my local organic store,
or I would have to order them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took the whole boxes of them and I
just mix them together in a trash bag
[SPEAKER_01]: really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, double the bag out and I
shake it like you shaking chicken and I
[SPEAKER_01]: shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it,
put it in the, um, in the bucket,
[SPEAKER_01]: put the lid on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I feed my plants in veg in the
beginning, I top dress in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they pretty much less is me about 30
days in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to feed again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do use in between that, um,
what I call tree stump, which is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for better lack of terms, it is a
recharge for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like tree stump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use recharge, nothing that gets
recharged off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works pretty awesome for what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I just, that's just my brain and
it's just cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I probably also use it
is because tree stump does not need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just pour it right into some water,
you know, measure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, measure that out and put it in the
water and it's ready to go off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I run out my local hydroponic store
also gives you free already made tea every
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you just gotta bring up, you gotta
bring a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use tree stump every, about once a
week, about once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then in flower, I'll top dress
again in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I don't have to do it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw pretty much feed probably twice
during my cycles in the beginning and
[SPEAKER_01]: then, um, in the beginning of a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the only two times that I
feed and it's in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, because I've been
running my organic for a minute now,
[SPEAKER_01]: that feed is already constantly in my
dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's constantly in my dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to feed as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say the first time me ever
switching over to dried amendments though,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have to top dress twice in veg and
then twice in flower to get to the level
[SPEAKER_01]: where now I don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the good part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about environment conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, do you supplement CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also what do you aim for,
for temperature and humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to temperature and
humidity, that's tough to answer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I say that is because
some people have a baseline of what they
[SPEAKER_01]: go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go off the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go off what I'm growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I have grown some cultivars where
they like the temperature to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 86 and humidity to be like 69%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've grown some cultivars where,
um, they like the regular baseline,
[SPEAKER_01]: 72, 78, you know, something like that is
temperature wise and then 62, 65 for
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, depending on the situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I pretty much researched the plant
and then maybe for me, I, I, I stress them
[SPEAKER_01]: like some people do training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I don't train, but I do,
I will stress the plant that a lot though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stress you out to your next to see
what happens if I don't give you air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you don't have no airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if your temperature is too high,
if your temperature, is too low,
[SPEAKER_01]: I will stress the plan out just to
understand that particular cultivar on
[SPEAKER_01]: what the baseline should be for that
particular cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how, that's how I do mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're talking about, let's just
say, you know, for back a lot of terms,
[SPEAKER_01]: a green pepper, and this particular green
pepper wants, um, you know, 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, and then, you know,
66 humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I get that green pepper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I might have a red pepper that
wants, you know, um, temperatures to be at
[SPEAKER_01]: 72 and humidity at 52, they're going to a
different, and that's what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's pretty much how I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can have two tents going on and
they're going to have two different
[SPEAKER_01]: environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to have the same
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to come into my tent and
see all the same environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you do anything with, with CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm just now learning CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as of right now, the way I met with
research wise, I haven't, I come across
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably know it's so needed yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we just breathe enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do want to, I do want to try it out
just to, um, see, I am interested to see
[SPEAKER_01]: like first hand see not just on the video,
the difference, but I haven't tried it
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I don't use CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I've been using those TNB Naturals
canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and now I actually just bought one of
those exhale bags, exhale CO2 bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be using those for the
first time and seeing how that compares to
[SPEAKER_00]: the canisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now how does the canisters work from
you not having the canisters?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've monitored like the PPM levels that
you also monitor PPM for CO2 as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been able to get upwards of a
thousand even more at some points,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, assuming it's a sealed
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes I'm exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I'm exhausting the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that up past a thousand just,
it doesn't really work with the canisters
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But monitoring the PPM levels,
I have got it up typically on average,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 700, 800 PPM, but upwards of a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does definitely work compared to
just not doing any sort of CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: supplementation at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think measuring CO2 is, I mean,
some people would say it's an overkill to
[SPEAKER_00]: even measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the meters cost so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally people don't even bother to get
any type of CO2 measurement going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have quite a bit of several years
experience growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for someone who's
just starting to grow for the first time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask yourself, do you really want to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to be a consumer of the things
that you're growing or do you want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into agriculture?
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand that if you're going to do
this, then do your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing I'm learning in this is just
do you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing for me has taught me to be okay
with failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say this a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing for me has taught me to be okay
with failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point I thought failing was not an
option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to stress myself out if I failed at
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would beat myself up if I failed at
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like a failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like anyone else, I got mental stress
and I was like other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it played a big part in my mental.
[SPEAKER_01]: And failure played a big part in my
mental.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was terrified of failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, for Gardening, it taught me to
be okay with failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It taught me to embrace failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, you learn, when you embrace
failure, I learned that you learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: things about yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reveals things about yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, Gardening has taught me a lot
about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it taught me to be okay with
certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fell in love with falling in love
again, which is the dopest thing ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in love with my friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in love with Gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in love with myself all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in love with who I'm becoming through
Gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in love with the interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to meet with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, with Gardening, I felt like if
you're going to do this, do your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be okay with what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let nobody, and I say this because
earlier I was talking about germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my biggest problems with
germination is because I allowed everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else his way to get in my head on how to
germinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not remembering how I started my first
girl ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first girl ever with germination was
never an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had an issue, and that wasn't an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that was my issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's like I issue with
germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because I allow everyone else to
tell me what's right and what's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in growing, there's no right or wrong
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no like, this is wrong
or that's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be PPMing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be know our DVDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not how this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm going to do my gardening to
where I see fit that helps me out what
[SPEAKER_01]: goes on in my garden, what goes on in my
climate, what goes on in my neck of the
[SPEAKER_01]: woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like if you're going to start
growing and get into gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: do what makes you happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a darn if you want to grow
blueberries from the damn ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, if you want to try that,
try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let anybody say, oh, you can't grow
blueberries from the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how are you going to know if you
don't try?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if you were growing stuff straight
up now, just straight up and down,
[SPEAKER_01]: they would have never known that if they
didn't try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it don't work, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just don't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you over try and try something
different, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people don't like it, then they
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let nobody tell you what not to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we do at Kennesys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kennesys stand for do not tell me what I
cannot do, sis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do whatever I put my mind to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't let nobody say you can't do
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just basically it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only advice I'll give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your own world.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just your world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't like your world,
tell them not to say get out.
That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go on to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some really good advice there
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
