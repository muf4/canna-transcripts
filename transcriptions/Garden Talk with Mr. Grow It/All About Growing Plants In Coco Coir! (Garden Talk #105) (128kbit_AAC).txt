[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 105.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 25 years and is
regarded as an expert on growing in cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we get into in today's
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about what cocoa is,
rinsing it, buffering it, pH, EC,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to bring free
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening information of all plants to the
general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.

[SPEAKER_00]: website, acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to have you on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually met a few months back at MJ
BizCon, so we had a little face-to-face in
[SPEAKER_00]: person, and we talked about you coming on
the podcast, and we talked about doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done this before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to actually do back-to-back
episodes with Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your knowledge on both Coco and LED are
just extensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really want to merge that into
one episode, so I figured, hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's do an episode on Coco, then the next
episode will be on LED, and it'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: back-to-back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the audience is going to like it
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two of the things that I've
devoted a lot of time and energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started off in this space really talking
about growing in Coco, and a few years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, I got heavy into researching lights
and doing the grow light calculator and
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where a lot of my passion
has been for the last few years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be able to explore both
sides of that with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I like to start all episodes is
really with an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a PhD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually study economic and agricultural
anthropology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work primarily with farmers in Central
America and Southern Mexico, peasant
[SPEAKER_01]: farming communities and understanding how
they manage livelihoods, to put it very
[SPEAKER_01]: simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they do their agricultural production
and how they make a living for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That got me as an undergraduate and as a
graduate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a graduate student doing
horticulture and botany classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially in grad school, I started doing
more specialized horticulture and
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural classes to understand it and
to be able to work with farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding both the horticultural and
botanical side of agricultural and crop
[SPEAKER_01]: production and to understand the economics
and a lot of the social dimensions of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a grad student, I was one of the
supervisors of the university organic
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a cool organic garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Students could get little plots to take
care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some research going on out there
and we had some classes that had a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the garden where they were doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually taught a class on small-scale
food production in that garden later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of that background, then I went
and did my research and lived in
[SPEAKER_01]: communities of farmers for about two years
doing my dissertation research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got really hands-on experience working in
those kinds of communities, but still all
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with other kinds of crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, those farmers grew primarily the
Mesoamerican Trilogy, corn, beans,
[SPEAKER_01]: and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few other crops around the edges of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working in the garden, scrying all sorts
of fruits and vegetables and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Southern California, where a lot
of different fruits and vegetables can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually in grad school that I was
recommended medical for my arthritis,
[SPEAKER_01]: my rheumatologist actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brought me into that dimension of
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been studying horticulture and
working with farmers for years leading up
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good stuff in your background in
regards to gardening and farming and even
[SPEAKER_00]: on the consulting side of things and
teaching people, which is really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked to teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the great things about moving into
this space in particular is all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: students are really interested to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach university classes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: University students are primarily
interested in getting a grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them will do what they have to do
in order to get the grade, but they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: really interested in learning the
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dealing with growers who are growing
plants and whether they're commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: scale growers that I do consulting work
with or small home growers that just have
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of plants in a tent in their
room, they want to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give a crap about doing well on
the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to make sure that they master
the material.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a teacher's perspective, it's so much
more joyous to teach students that are
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated by learning rather than just
motivated by grades.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to learn as little as possible and
still get the grade that I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the mindset behind that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's this other cohort in
universities that are just there because
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't know what else to do with
themselves at that age and time in their
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were always told, this is the next
thing you're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go there somewhat mindlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of students in your standard
university, they're actually primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated by learning, like five percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You love them when you get those students
in a regular university class.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Dr. MJ Coco, I would say it's the
opposite, like 95 percent of the students
[SPEAKER_01]: of the people that come and that I
interact with are really anxious to gain
[SPEAKER_01]: access to the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that makes your job a little
bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so much more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's force-feeding people stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be on the test?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's going to be on the test.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want us to teach like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into growing in Coco Coyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess first thing is to talk about the
pronunciation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to say Coco Coyer and somebody had
corrected me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, actually, it's Coco Coyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked on Google and looked at
pronunciation and blah, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and found out they were correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be the pronunciation
police and say, nobody should say Coco
[SPEAKER_00]: Coyer, but I thought it was worth
mentioning that I guess that the proper
[SPEAKER_00]: way to say it is actually Coco Coyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also a linguist and I'm more of what
we would call a descriptive linguist than
[SPEAKER_01]: a prescriptive linguist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking more like a prescriptive
linguist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a correct way to do things and we
should all follow that norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the prescription for how you're
supposed to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how your high school English
teacher taught English.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a proper pronunciation or proper
grammar and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most linguists that study real language,
they're descriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll describe what people are actually
doing rather than pontificate about what
[SPEAKER_01]: they should do, but they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like ending a sentence with a preposition
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your English teacher is likely to give you
a prescriptive rule, but you go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to how people actually talk in the
world and most of them break those rules
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this one in particular, yeah,
I'm willing to accept different
[SPEAKER_01]: pronunciations on it, but I guess stewing
closely to the origin, it would be Coyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm often guilty of just pronouncing
things the way that they're written,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially on scripts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that quite famously in my How to
Buffer Coco video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do I call it CocoCore,
and I know better than this, I said Cation
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of Cation, but it's almost
impossible for me not to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is now because I've been pounded
with that, but I was reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading that word written, I'm very
tempted to pronounce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, since my background in Spanish,
I'm very tempted to pronounce it according
[SPEAKER_01]: to Spanish, pronunciation rules
oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, tomatoes, tomatoes, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really actually interesting is from
a linguistics perspective, I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: watching how language does change and how
particular people influence that language
[SPEAKER_01]: change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Us talking about whether it's CocoCore or
CocoCoyer or however you want to pronounce
[SPEAKER_01]: it has some influence on how other people
then go about talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is CocoCoyer?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just coconut husk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the brown husk of the coconut
fruit, which is dried and then ground into
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's basically three different types of
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get the fine particles that are
almost like dust, which we call peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cocoa peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can have the fibers, which are
like these stringy things, which are the
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get chips, which are less broken
down, still hunks of the coconut husk,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chips have the best air holding
capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the fiber holds on to a lot of
air too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a higher enough concentration
of fiber, you'll have a good air holding
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peat or the dust holds on to more
water and less air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a blend of peat,
fiber, and chips when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through the course of time, the chips will
break down into fiber and peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peat breaks down into smaller and
smaller and smaller pieces of peat,
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that's caused by root action.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to grow in cocoa that has
too much of the finest peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes, we'll rinse it through a
colander or another screen or a sieve or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that lets the finest particles
rinse out and keeps the larger particles
[SPEAKER_01]: behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing that, you can actually recycle cocoa
indefinitely because you're getting rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the oldest cocoa that's broken down the
most each time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have to add more cocoa on the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend growers do that with their
cocoa grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no reason to throw it out and get
new cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when you get cocoa, you can either
get it in a brick form or a bagged form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those bricks of cocoa are compressed just
like the brick used to be compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lower quality, but you can
rehabilitate it to a large extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bricks have generally a larger
proportion is dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: A larger proportion is the finer
particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always recommend rehydrating it and
rinsing it through a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll yield less.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to lose a lot of that dust,
but that's the point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll end up with a pretty good quality
cocoa if you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bags usually have more chips and more
fiber, a larger particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: You yield more from the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bags are often also pre-buffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: In theory, you could use it right out of
the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There aren't a lot of brands of cocoa that
I trust right out of the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I almost always end up processing my cocoa
to some extent before using it,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if I buy an expensive bagged cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the processing is certainly less than
it would be with a brick, which you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through several steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You rehydrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you rinse it through a screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you do a couple buffering soaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you drain it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you rinse down the residual EC so you
don't burn your plant roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that takes time, a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bagged process, oftentimes,
with some bagged products, good bagged
[SPEAKER_01]: products, I'll just put in a pot and run
some water through it to saturate it and
[SPEAKER_01]: test the EC of the water that's coming
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as that's low enough, I'll trust
the cocoa basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you have to run more water
through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some products I'd recommend doing a
buffering soak and then rinsing it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, there's just less work to do to
get them prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: They cost more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each individual grower needs to put their
own drudgery to cost index, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually one of the things that I study
with my farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how much drudgery are you
willing to invest in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is just spending an extra 20, 40,
60, 80 bucks that drudgery are you willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay to avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rehydrating, rinsing, and buffering of
the bricks is definitely time-consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a handful of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally prefer buying the bagged
cocoa now to avoid that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can imagine being in a different
financial position and being like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hell no, I got time to burn and I do not
have any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are at different points of that
continuum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into the rinsing and
buffering because I know there's quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: few people who have no idea what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many growers have hit me
up over the years with their plants
[SPEAKER_00]: showing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them if they've rinsed their
buffer and they're like, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about rinsing and buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it important?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a really good,
good video on it, so you can keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty brief and we'll refer people to
that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can give us an overview here,
that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa, we talked a little bit about the
dust and particularly in a brick of cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to have more dust than you
want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to rinse that dust
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rinsing is largely just about getting rid
of the smallest particle sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also going to knock some of the
sodium out of the cocoa if it comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium, but most of that's going to be
bound in a cation bond.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to really deal with that
until you buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Buffering is the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rinsing, I just rinse through literally a
colander or a sieve, a screen and get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of the smallest particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Collect that and you don't want to rinse
it too thoroughly either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to get rid of all of the
peat because the peat is really what holds
[SPEAKER_01]: the water, but you don't want it to just
be swimming in the smallest particles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see this when you start rinsing it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water that comes out is brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: After just a few seconds, it's no longer
brown and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to keep rinsing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you want to put it in a strong
solution of Cal Mag, Cal Mag and iron,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, but primarily calcium and magnesium,
which are both double charged cations.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about cocoa being an inert growing
media and that's one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: really like about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would actually argue that the air-water
ratio is a better selling point of cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: than just the inert aspect of it,
but it is pretty inert in that it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with the nutrient water that
we're providing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't interact with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sits there like a sponge and holds
the water, but doesn't engage in exchanges
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one exception to that is cocoa comes
naturally with some single charged cations
[SPEAKER_01]: that it will give up and take double
charged cations out of the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, cocoa comes with some sodium
and some potassium, so K, cations that are
[SPEAKER_01]: already part of the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the presence of calcium or magnesium,
the cocoa will release that sodium and
[SPEAKER_01]: that potassium and grab onto the calcium
or the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates really strong bonds with the
calcium or the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's unlikely in any situation to release
those calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I often get this question, once it's
buffered, is that those cation exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: sites are buffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their calcium, they're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically taken out of the
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do almost anything to that cocoa
at this point and that cation exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: site will not give up its calcium cation.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one of the things that we do with
buffering is we're just trying to get as
[SPEAKER_01]: many of those exchanges to take place as
possible before adding plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take this cocoa that's got this
potassium and the sodium and we soak it in
[SPEAKER_01]: really strong Kalmag water, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It releases all the potassium and the
sodium and grabs onto the calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it does that, it's considered
buffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't do that in advance and we use
unbuffered cocoa, and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you've ever had the misfortune of using
really unbuffered cocoa, but it will suck
[SPEAKER_01]: all the calcium and magnesium out of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost impossible to keep up with
because the cocoa will get the calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium before the plants can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost no matter how much you provide,
you're never going to provide enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: get out of that deficit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do a good job buffering before
using the cocoa, you can definitely keep
[SPEAKER_01]: up with the Kalmag requirements during the
rest of the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never fully go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, we have cocoa chips and cocoa
peat and the cocoa fibers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly breaking down largely due to
root action of the plants that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the plants themselves grow through,
they break apart the cocoa and that
[SPEAKER_01]: exposes new cation sites and that exposes
new potassium and sodium that the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to release and grab onto the
calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cocoa is always a little thirsty for
calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In cocoa, we always provide a bonus dose,
which is not for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really for the cocoa itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing to be aware of with cocoa
is we're almost always running high in K.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because the cocoa has K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers often get themselves in trouble
later in the cycle because they'll add a
[SPEAKER_01]: PK boost, a bloom booster, which just
creates K tox, so potassium toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium toxicity can lock out calcium
and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can create other issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growers in cocoa often face issues when
trying to use those PK boosters just
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's already a lot of K.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware of that other dimension of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say they have properly rinsed and
buffered their cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic or synthetic nutrients,
let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use or recommend organic or
synthetic nutrients when growing in cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an outdoor setting and field
agriculture and in gardening, I always
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend organic models and really
biodynamic models where we try to
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivate the ecology on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil level and farm level ecology
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase sustainability and decrease
the throughput of chemical fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: of fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of what we're growing our food with
these days are nitrogen, potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: and phosphorus fertilizers derived from
natural gas, a fossil fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process to create them is incredibly
energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made with and they're made from
fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Global agriculture on the large scale is
supported by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think about how we use fossil
fuels going forward too, so much of our
[SPEAKER_01]: global agriculture is dependent on natural
gas as a feedstock for nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could argue we're eating fossil fuel
energy on a massive scale, which puts a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of those considerations into a
different perspective, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: than people are often used to looking at
fossil fuels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I'm really interested in since
my undergraduate days is sustainability in
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the rubs here, and it's something
that we've all decided to go past this,
[SPEAKER_01]: but indoor farming under artificial lights
is not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very energy intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It uses energy in a wildly different way
than farmers have ever used energy before.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first 10,000 years that our
species was farmers, we used almost
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusively human and animal energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we started supplementing fossil fuel
energy over the last 150 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first half of that time,
it was basically for transportation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, again, so much of the energy that
we use in regular agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor agriculture, is in the fertilizers
that we're applying to maintain crop
[SPEAKER_01]: yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just use of energy and the
sustainability of that have completely
[SPEAKER_01]: shifted into this dangerous territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think rightly, a lot of people have
become concerned with global agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: and the source of our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether we'll be able to maintain these
kinds of yields under biodynamic models.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was something that I looked at a lot
as a graduate student.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we conserve?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we maintain the Green Revolution
yields without using the Green Revolution
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to continue to investigate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely understand that crops,
are more efficient in their specific
[SPEAKER_01]: return when we're able to dial in
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop yields, for example, in the global
north, crop yields on conventional acreage
[SPEAKER_01]: is a little over, and this is somewhat
dated information from the 2010s,
[SPEAKER_01]: around 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crop yields were about two and a half
times as on organic cropland, primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: due to fertilization issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the global south, biodynamic farming is
actually able to match the yields of
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional agriculture, but they invest
a tremendously more labor per acre than
[SPEAKER_01]: they do in the global north.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, we're able to exchange fossil
fuel energy for human labor can take over
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of that, but where the cost of labor
is high, those balances don't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent literally years trying to
understand and asking students in
[SPEAKER_01]: questioning classes, do you guys want to
become peasants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's one way we can create a
sustainable world is we all go back to
[SPEAKER_01]: being peasants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we all insist on having these
consumer lifestyles, it's more
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where we demand other people produce
all of our foods, so we don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce any of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor agriculture, it's all about lights,
and it's all about maintaining climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We choose to do that because of legal
concerns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: With some other crops, they choose to grow
indoors other crops in places like
[SPEAKER_01]: Iceland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iceland's got a thriving indoor
horticulture industry for vegetables
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't have any sun or not
enough of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've got tons of geothermal energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So energy is cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can power LED lights indoors and
justify growing lower value crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we're spending so much energy
on the lights and the climate control
[SPEAKER_01]: growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be growing a higher value crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, it doesn't even make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of energy that we're
spending on lighting absolutely dwarfs the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of energy that we're spending on
fertilizers, just dwarfs it, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: makes pennies out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the amount of energy that we're
investing in fertilizers is now like no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer even part of the equation that
makes sense to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want to farm sustainably
indoors, A, we have to recognize that we
[SPEAKER_01]: really can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're choosing to do something that's
unsustainable because there's no other way
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've decided that a certain crop is
valuable enough to us that we're making
[SPEAKER_01]: that decision anyways, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all growers that are growing
indoors for legal reasons, for other kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of reasons are making that decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, look, growing this plant is
important enough to me that I'm doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: even though I've got to run these really
powerful lights indoors and even though
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to be the most sustainable
thing in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're making those decisions,
I think it becomes imperative now that you
[SPEAKER_01]: think about how to limit your overall sort
of consumption, how to grow the best crop
[SPEAKER_01]: you can with the least amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're already sort of blowing
our energy budget on lighting and climate
[SPEAKER_01]: control, then how do we tap into the best
of what we know about all other forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture so that we can have these
plants humming so that they don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: want for anything and so that we can
guarantee harvest success?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality there is the most
sustainable, I mean, I really looked into
[SPEAKER_01]: this before growing myself, the most
sustainable way and the only real way that
[SPEAKER_01]: I could justify indoor horticulture coming
from a background of sort of sustainable
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture was to grow conventionally and
to grow hydroponically, so soil-lessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa is a form of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that growing in cocoa is far more
efficient with water than DWC,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and this is the reason I
don't grow in DWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, DWC growers dump far more water
down the drain than cocoa growers do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even cocoa growers that have the sort of
awful name for this, which is drain to
[SPEAKER_01]: waste, and that is the way that I grow,
drain to waste, but the amount of water
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm sending down the waste is dwarfed
to whenever a DWC grower has to change out
[SPEAKER_01]: their tanks and they're sending all of
their water down the drain or they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sending all their water someplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only sending a cup a day for my little
grow, you know, or a quart a day or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, really small amounts
that I actually repurpose all of my runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: for houseplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just tiny amount of it, so drain to
houseplant or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so that's basically,
and you know, there are ways to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked this original question with
organics or conventional fertilizers or
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic fertilizers, so I use synthetic
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some organic fertilizers that
can be substituted for them, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: found them to be, you know, an advantage
from a sustainability angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of thinking about how much
energy, are they going to slow my crop
[SPEAKER_01]: down at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I have to run, you know,
an extra week in veg, I've blown my
[SPEAKER_01]: margins and whatever you're trying to save
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if this puts, you know, in any way my
crop at risk, like I've blown my margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also aware now that a lot of people
sort of follow the way that I grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pretty closely in terms of my
specific dosages of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: my recipe, my frequency of fertigation,
all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's important that, you know,
cumulatively we're aware of the impact
[SPEAKER_01]: that we have and that we're sort of doing
this consciously in a way to try to reduce
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of pushback from organic
growers that think that their style of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing is responsible and my style of
growing is sort of irresponsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I want to just suggest to all
growers that it really requires thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper through these problems and
recognizing, especially in an indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture, like where does our impact
really come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how can we responsibly sort of work to
minimize that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was from that perspective that,
you know, my background's not in grad
[SPEAKER_01]: school.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background was working with field
agriculture farmers that were using
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic and kind of organic styles of
fertilization, but like they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in cocoa core.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't growing hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that, that really came when I
decided to grow my own indoors that I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to figure out and to sort of use
the experience that I did have and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I was still a grad student,
sort of my penchant for doing that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: research to figure out the best way to
minimize this impact, to do the most
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is also incidentally why I'm so sort
of interested in lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I really test about lights is how
efficient they are and sort of how well
[SPEAKER_01]: they distribute the light and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we're doing this, if we're making
that decision to grow indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's do it as well as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of my audience are indoor
home growers, kind of similar to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I feel like a lot of folks are using
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's narrow down the conversation a
little bit to indoors and let's talk a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about using synthetic nutrients
with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into like EC and pH and
stuff like that, aeration options.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some people who are
adding in, like I used to add in perlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people add in pumice, vermiculite,
lava rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different aeration
options.
[SPEAKER_00]: What aeration options do you recommend and
at what ratio aeration to cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Container size depends primarily on
watering frequency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to be the type of
grower that only wants to water their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants once or twice a day, and I realize
that might sound like pretty frequently,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I advocate high frequency for
irrigation in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once or twice a day, you're going to
want water in a larger container.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to go five, six times a
day, you're going to be able to get away
[SPEAKER_01]: with a smaller container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage you to kind of think of
the container that you're growing in as
[SPEAKER_01]: like the cup that you give like your
guests at a party.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you give them a small cup,
you better be running around and refilling
[SPEAKER_01]: their cups all of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give them a larger cup,
like, you know, you don't have to fill up
[SPEAKER_01]: their cups all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water watering, in my sense,
is filling up the cup.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, if you're going to water six
times a day, then you can grow big plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in a one gallon container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I totally endorse that style.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to only water once a day,
then you can grow that same plant in a
[SPEAKER_01]: three or five gallon container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be a better option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, your question is actually about
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perlite ratio depends on the size of
the container and to some extent,
[SPEAKER_01]: your watering frequency as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Larger containers, I like to put more
perlite in more of that aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, it certainly aerates perlite,
certainly aerates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really what we're hoping to get out
of the perlite is improved drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coco holds on to water a little bit too
wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like to encourage the water to drain
out a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the good things that
perlite does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coco, unless you have all dust,
remember talking about like chips and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have fibers in addition to your dust,
then cocoa stays pretty well oxygenated,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if it's at field capacity,
which means like fully saturated,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still oxygen available to the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happens if you're in a large
enough container and it's the dissolved
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen in the water accounts for a large
proportion of the available oxygen to
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're watering infrequently,
especially if you're watering less than
[SPEAKER_01]: once per day, especially if the water
sitting in the pots is above 70 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: which it almost always is in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a few hours, there's not going to be
a lot of dissolved oxygen in that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hypoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have an area that doesn't have
a lot of roots, so the roots are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: where most of the water gets taken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We often think about the water sort of
like just pouring through the pots,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're, we're filling a cup and then
the plant is like drinking that cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the reasons we transplant up to
make sure there's roots all the way in the
[SPEAKER_01]: center, because it's really in the right
in the middle of like, you have a big pot
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the middle of that pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots tend to grow around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow out to the edges.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow down to the bottom and they'll
leave this area in the middle of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a lot of roots sucking out
the water and the water is allowed to get
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of like stagnant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it doesn't have perlite to sort of
vertically flow through, it'll become
[SPEAKER_01]: hypoxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically a dead zone for roots
because there's no oxygen for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing in like a big
container, get a lot of aeration in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of that, make sure that,
you know, the water is going to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to move through there because roots like
that area less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tends to become sort of stagnant
and not as well sort of oxygenated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversely, if you're growing a big plant
in a one gallon pot, you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, adding too much perlite just sort
of cuts down on the amount of water that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can store in that pot because,
you know, a one gallon pot that's full up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a hundred percent cocoa can hold a
little over half a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A one gallon pot that's stock full of like
50, 50 cocoa perlite can hold less than
[SPEAKER_01]: half a gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're sort of cutting back sort of the
reservoir function of the pot for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to require you to
increase fertigation more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go anywhere from no perlite to only like
10 to 20% sometimes up to 50% perlite in a
[SPEAKER_01]: larger container with less frequent
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So perlite is your go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't recommend like formiculate or
lava rock, any of those other options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perlite is definitely my go-to or one of
the specific perlite substitutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think formiculate is a good
substitute for perlite and cocoa for this
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Formiculate tends to hold on to water
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does do some of the same aeration,
but it's not as good at sort of aiding in
[SPEAKER_01]: drainage as perlite is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lava rock, can work for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other things that you can
substitute perlite for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm aware that some growers don't like
to use perlite specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that there's a couple of
drawbacks to using perlite that should be
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think whenever it's brought up,
do not allow yourself to breathe perlite
[SPEAKER_01]: dust ever, ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It causes, it's like so much worse than
smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's moments worse than like
anything else you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a respirator, a ventilator,
do it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an outdoor space, at least wear like a
N95 mask or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see so many people either on sort of
videos or in real life or walking through
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facilities where people are
dealing with perlite, just breathing in
[SPEAKER_01]: this cloud of perlite dust disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't put yourself in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perlite is also a mined resource and
there's a limited sort of global supply of
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're not sort of at a threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually think the peat is a bigger
issue to be worried about and concerned in
[SPEAKER_01]: those regards in terms of how sustainable
the mining of the resource is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice on the mask.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wear a mask and I probably should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really hear people talking about
the safety behind handling perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely be wearing a mask
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get the vents on or whatever you can do
to, I mean, whenever you pour perlite and
[SPEAKER_01]: get it wet right away so knock down that
cloud of dust, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you get a bag of perlite and you
pour it, you're going to have this like
[SPEAKER_01]: cloud of rock dust that you get to breathe
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into pH of, you know,
specifically when growing with synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in cocoa, what is the optimal pH
range?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hydroponic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant is for the most part
interacting directly with the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sort of mitigating by any other
cation exchange or microbial activity or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we keep generally for hydroponic
nutrients, the pH between 5.5 and 6.5 is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's often quoted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never kind of push out those
extremes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is more available at the higher
end of that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So early on, I usually recommend growers
in cocoa start at like 6.2-ish,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then buy early veg, have worked down,
you know, in the high fives and allow the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH to sort of drift up.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH almost always drifts up if you're
mixing nutrient water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to set it like 5.8 and allow it to
drift up to 6, 6.1, 6.2, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in that range, allowing it to drift back
and forth a little bit ensures the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: have good access to the different chelated
nutrients that are sort of more accessible
[SPEAKER_01]: at different points along that pH scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to drill it in at 5.6 for
too long, basically, because calcium's not
[SPEAKER_01]: very available that low.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also don't want to sort of drill it in
at 6.4 for too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus isn't very available there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping it kind of in the middle of
that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I suggest with most forms
of hydroponics, certainly with any form of
[SPEAKER_01]: drain-to-waste hydroponics, is to only
measure the inflow pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't measure the outflow or the runoff
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in our DWC recirculating systems,
you know, you got to measure both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all kind of the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in DWC, you got to just measure
whatever they're sitting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a drain-to-waste setting,
where you're doing top feed in cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: the important thing about pH is that the
water that you're providing has nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that are accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not, I really can't stress this
enough, you are not trying to like change
[SPEAKER_01]: the runoff pH by altering the inflow pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fool's errand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen dozens and dozens of growers
torch their plants by doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The runoff pH starts to drift high,
often is what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll just go lower and lower and
lower with the inflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're telling me, I'm feeding at
five and I'm still getting these plant
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and my runoff is still 6.8 or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, stop feeding at five.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can chase your tail like that so
easily and just run yourself right out of
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of what the acceptable range is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so, I tell growers literally don't
measure the runoff pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Expect it to swing because of cation
exchange with the plant, things are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen to that water that's going to
knock around that pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll never look at the pH, the runoff pH,
except as a secondary sort of diagnosis
[SPEAKER_01]: tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're having problems with maintaining
EC, for example, if your runoff EC is
[SPEAKER_01]: always high, so you do check the runoff
EC, but not the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's always high and we can't knock
it down, eventually I'm going to tell,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, let's figure out what the EC or the
pH is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll try to get deeper into a
diagnosis about what's going on like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, as part of your general practice,
make sure the water you're providing to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is in the correct range and just
don't even worry about what the runoff's
[SPEAKER_01]: coming in at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had good luck going 5.8 pH
going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I first started using Cocoa,
I was checking the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was coming across that same exact issue
that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, why is it 6.8 pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it 7 pH runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was scrambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so tempting to go like five and
then lower on the inflow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I read to ignore the runoff pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ever since I've been doing that,
my plants have been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm really glad you mentioned
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, now as far as water that you're
giving it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the cool thing about this style
of growing anyways, is like no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: screwed up the situation's gotten in their
pot, like I can still give them good water
[SPEAKER_01]: that I know is correct now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them good water that you know is
correct now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now EC, sometimes we do sort of,
if the EC is getting too high in the
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff, you go lower on the inflow to sort
of correct for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's where you're
going next, but that's probably where we
[SPEAKER_01]: should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I was going to ask about
next is EC, or some people actually
[SPEAKER_00]: measure PPM instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing, different calculation,
but different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant has different nutrient
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people start with a low EC and then
work their way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about EC and Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, let's talk a little bit about EC
versus PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC is a measure of electrical
conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have an EC or a PPM or a TDS or
what's just called a water quality meter,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's measuring is EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little probe, two little
electrical probes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's passing electrical current through
the water and it's measuring sort of how
[SPEAKER_01]: easy that current flows through the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why that's important is a few things,
but that tells you how many sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved solids are in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's no dissolved solids in the
water, then it's very hard to pass an
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical current through water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a chock full of calcium,
then it's pretty easy to pass a current
[SPEAKER_01]: through the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the EC reading tells you sort of how
salty, because all those things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: dissolved in the water, we can just
consider them and think about them as
[SPEAKER_01]: being salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically telling you how salty
the water is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, PPM is parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: And parts per million tries to tell you
how many sort of parts per million in this
[SPEAKER_01]: water are different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, how many parts of calcium
and phosphorus and iron and potassium and
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium are in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what a PPM meter does is it measures
the electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then using a formula, it says,
OK, if the electrical conductivity is
[SPEAKER_01]: this, then I assume so much of this water,
so much of that is coming from calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: because in most water, in most places
around the world, the bulk of the
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical conductivity comes from
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is a double charged cation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has sort of a bigger impact on
electrical conductivity than on PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each unit of calcium is only one PPM,
but has a double charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have one unit of calcium and one
unit of sodium, your PPM would be maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: two out of a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: But your electrical conductivity is going
to be higher because of that calcium being
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to make an estimate about sort
of how much stuff is in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: all we know is how easy it is to pass
electricity through it, how much stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: in the water, there's different formulas
for figuring that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why we have different PPM
scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, there's less calcium in the
water than there is in the Americas in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're making an estimate about
from electrical conductivity, two parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million, you're going to assume that
sort of there must be more other stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I think there's a little bit
smaller ratio of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that gives them sort of the scale,
the 700 PPM scale in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: where calcium is tends to be in larger
proportion throughout the Americas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium tends to be in large proportion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use 500 scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a different formula for
going from what the meter's measuring is
[SPEAKER_01]: the electrical conductivity to different
assumptions about what must be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: water to arrive at a guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really just a guess about what
that PPM is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a PPM meter, your meter's
measuring electrical conductivity and then
[SPEAKER_01]: using a formula to guess what the actual
PPM is.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another way we can approach coming
out PPM, where we could get a scale and
[SPEAKER_01]: dry nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can actually weigh out and know
exactly sort of how many parts calcium and
[SPEAKER_01]: how many parts phosphorus and how many
parts everything that we put in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could describe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can reverse engineer this if you
get good information from your nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: companies in terms of what your PPM
actually is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that angle, we think about PPM in
terms of dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many parts per million do we want of
calcium?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many parts per million do we want of
phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many parts per million do we want?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when we're thinking in terms
of parts per million, people tend to think
[SPEAKER_01]: about it in terms of all these different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing that I often get from
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, why does the PPM matter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't it matter what the PPM of nitrogen
and phosphorus and potassium is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I just need one number that
describes all of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a damn good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need one PPM number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not why we're measuring EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if all you have is a PPM meter,
you can basically sort of crib off of that
[SPEAKER_01]: because what your meter's actually
measuring is EC anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're doing this for and why we
measure it has nothing to do with making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure there's enough nitrogen and enough
phosphorus and enough potassium and enough
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium and making sure those dosages are
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We never use electrical conductivity to
measure dose of specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We measure electrical conductivity to
understand the overall salinity of the
[SPEAKER_01]: water because the overall salinity of the
water, it affects the plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: get water, not the plant's ability to get
nitrogen and phosphorus and calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically assume all that's there
because I followed a recipe and I'm using
[SPEAKER_01]: reputable nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ratios better be there based on the
products that you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you provide too much of them and
you're giving your plant this water that's
[SPEAKER_01]: then really salty, the plant will not be
able to get the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to be able to keep the sort of
overall electrical conductivity in a range
[SPEAKER_01]: where the plant A sort of is trained for
it and B expects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the most part, I think growers try
to sort of push their plants a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: too much in electrical conductivity,
thinking about it in terms of I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: provide more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to provide more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to like push the gas pedal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you don't realize is as you're
pushing the gas pedal, you're making
[SPEAKER_01]: osmosis harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to get water, if there's like
a cell membrane, there's water inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: root and then there's water like in the
cocoa in this case on the outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: root.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the water outside the root is really
salty, the plant gets water through
[SPEAKER_01]: osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant needs to increase the
concentration of the solution of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically it does this by manufacturing
sugars so that there's a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of sugars in the water
inside the root than the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: salts in the water outside the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that allows water to flow into the
root because water flows from osmosis
[SPEAKER_01]: across that sort of gradient from the area
of lower concentration to the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration of dissolved solids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your plant can be trained for a higher
electrical conductivity basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can like gradually work plants up and
up and up and they'll keep manufacturing
[SPEAKER_01]: more sugars and more sugars in their roots
to be able to sort of continue to absorb
[SPEAKER_01]: this water despite the increasing
salinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some growers can get away with sort of
training their plants to take a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: high electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily think that that's
beneficial, but like plants can be trained
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you jump electrical conductivity
too fast, if they've been used to say like
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.0 and you suddenly go to like 2.0,
like you've doubled it, there's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be enough sugar in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be so much salts in
the water outside the roots that water
[SPEAKER_01]: literally gets sucked out of the root.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever poured salt on a slug?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what happens in this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So water actually can get pulled out of
the root through osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason we test electrical
conductivity is all about osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really all about keeping that
electrical conductivity in the range that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant is expecting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it goes down too much, the plant starts
taking in more water than it wants to take
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It quickly has to convert those sugars to
starches and sort of to stop that process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That requires energy that the plant is not
growing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the electrical conductivity quickly
goes up, then the plant has to manufacture
[SPEAKER_01]: new sugars using energy that now it's not
using to grow with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're swinging the electrical
conductivity up and down and back and
[SPEAKER_01]: forth, I know a lot of growers do an
alternating flush where basically it's one
[SPEAKER_01]: watering at like a really high EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next watering, plain water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next watering, really high EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next watering, plain water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your poor plant is just like, oh,
it's salty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to increase sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's not salty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to process those sugars into
starches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's salty again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're just making your plant work
every single day to adjust to the salinity
[SPEAKER_01]: level of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of the number one thing that I
think, if you're using an EC of your,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some people fertilize with much lower
ECs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of okay to go back and
forth in terms of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's in a style like cocoa,
certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll pick up a lot if you just go to
feed every time at the right dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants love consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants really love consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like my number one sort of
theoretical idea about plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep them at that level that they're
good with the electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be swinging them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be able to sort of invest much
more energy into growth than they would if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're swinging them around like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're growing in cocoa,
we want to know the electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity of the water that goes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fairly low target.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.5 is pretty much the highest I'll ever
put my inflow at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 1500 or 1.5 on an EC scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to monitor the runoff so that
the runoff is not getting too much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than the inflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm going in at 1.5 or 1500,
and again, this is like late flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's the highest that I ever get my
inflow EC up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.2 is sort of where I'd be in veg for
most of the time or an earlier flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if I'm going in at say 1.2,
then I want my runoff to be within 1.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.6 is going to start raising my eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes above 1.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to start to take action to
bring the runoff EC back down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to keep it within 300,
within 400 is usually OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in that range, so above what the
inflow is, usually we can expect the
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical conductivity will go up in
between watering events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about the water that
you're adding to the top of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's new water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water that comes out the bottom is not
that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water that comes out the bottom is old
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's already been sitting and that kind of
gets pushed out the plant as new water
[SPEAKER_01]: gets added to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: That old water has been sitting there for
a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would expect that the EC is going
to be higher because generally the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: removes water faster than it removes
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so nutrients accumulate in the pot and
the electrical conductivity goes up in
[SPEAKER_01]: between fertigation events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we notice that it's going up too
much, so the runoff is now like 2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fed at 1.5 for 1,500 and it's coming out
at 2 or 2,000, then I probably need to
[SPEAKER_01]: feed more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing that I would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving too much time in between these
events and that's allowing the EC to creep
[SPEAKER_01]: up too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increasing the frequency or the decreasing
the interval between feeding events is
[SPEAKER_01]: likely to resolve that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the best way to resolve that
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, for whatever reason,
you can try increasing quantity,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that results in additional runoff or
lowering the inflow electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity to sort of allow for a larger
rise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now growers that are only able to
fertigate like once or twice a day
[SPEAKER_01]: generally have to sort of allow for a
larger rise than growers that can
[SPEAKER_01]: fertigate five or six times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One area I actually want to get into,
which is somewhat controversial,
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculating with microbes, specifically
when growing cocoa and using synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some people that say it's
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've seen a benefit inoculating with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilizing microbes during their grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other people that say this is
completely false.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should not be inoculating with
microbes because the medium is inert.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrients are already in a form that's
available for the plant to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbes don't have any value.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I certainly think they have less
value than they do in other styles of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regardless of style of fertilization,
there are some microbial activity that
[SPEAKER_01]: works in the same synergy in the
rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the roots that aid in nutrient
uptake, even in a cocoa grow, even in a
[SPEAKER_01]: DWC grow, even in a DWC grow that's
running sterile, you know, with like a
[SPEAKER_01]: high concentration of hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are still symbiotic relationships
with bacteria in the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are like every style of growing
sort of requires some bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some styles, we need to maintain that
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think organic growers
that are depending on sort of breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: down organic fertilizers into sort of
plant accessible farms can really get a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge boost from sort of inoculating with
some bacteria or inoculating with
[SPEAKER_01]: different microorganisms at the right time
of their grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, treating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the challenges with any kind of
synthetic drain to waste system in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular is, you know, the whole idea of
drain to waste is we're getting rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sort of flushing a little bit out
each watering event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it somewhat harder to
maintain, you know, microbial communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also not necessarily feeding them
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in organic nutrients,
growers sometimes use stuff like,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, a fairly famous one is
molasses, which is really used primarily
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed, you know, microbes that then feed
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily used to feed the
plant directly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you're not using those
things, it becomes a little bit sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: less beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are still times and places for
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do a great deal of inoculation,
but I'm aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of lean towards the side where we
are able to take control of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilization and sort of, you know,
a lot of what the plant's able to absorb
[SPEAKER_01]: and uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the downside would be wasting
money and resources using a product that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not sort of getting a benefit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that there's a downside
in terms of, you know, doing that is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to screw up your plant or is necessarily
going to cause problems either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to I always like to separate
practices, grower practice, because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all sorts of different grower
practices out there into things that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, beneficial, harmful,
and then probably not either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, beneficial or harmful practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would put a lot of the ways
synthetic growers use microbes as probably
[SPEAKER_01]: not beneficial or harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least in the root zones like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose on the other side of this is
that is one of the reasons why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing this style, why we're investing in
those nitrogen fertilizers, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: at this scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're like I said, the top of the
podcast, we get those nitrogen fertilizers
[SPEAKER_01]: from natural gas and in a really energy
intensive process in order to sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: separate the nitrogen from the
hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, at the scale that we're
growing and considering these other
[SPEAKER_01]: things, I tend to think that that makes it
worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that does sort of alleviate the need
to practice deep ecology within our
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still like taking that ecological
approach where it makes sense to and where
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes sense to at that point is more
than sort of the IPM side on the pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: side on the, you know, beneficial insects
and that ecological approach in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: working with biology to solve our problems
as opposed to sort of trying to be God.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll admit there's a certain aspect of
my style of growing where I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of be God in this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figure I have to create the sun for
these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to try to sort of hand feed
them everything else as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are coming up towards the end of the
episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to ask you, is there anything
else in regards to growing in cocoa using
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics that you wanted to cover in
this episode that we didn't cover?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think we covered a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I appreciate sort of having
the opportunity to talk about those
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainability angles on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that that's sort of the only
reason to grow in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a point that I like to make to people
because it's something that's important to
[SPEAKER_01]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you guys are interested out there
in the audience in terms of sort of being
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable with your home grow,
to think more about some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: dimensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think sometimes choosing quote unquote
organic options is sort of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in maybe more about the karma
relief as opposed to the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental relief that you're getting
out of that in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to think through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think talking about calcium,
magnesium and cocoa is always important in
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of getting that message about
buffering and continuing to provide a Cal
[SPEAKER_01]: Mag dose in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: High frequency fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the fact that cocoa,
even at field capacity, holds on to
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate oxygen for the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm definitely on the side that there
is no such thing as overwatering really in
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens isn't that the plants have
too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is that the plants don't have
enough oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of the things that we're used to
thinking about in terms of quote unquote
[SPEAKER_01]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're coming from peat or if
you're coming from heaven forbid soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't peat, most growers that think
they're growing in quote unquote soil are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually growing in peat soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this sense would be like dirt,
like, you know, sand, silt, clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're used to having to really limit the
amount of water that you provide or having
[SPEAKER_01]: to create a dry bag period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of this is really about
maintaining adequate oxygen for the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about starving the plants of
water, but the only way to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: adequate oxygen in the roots is starving
them from water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if, if overwatering was just about
overwatering, like DWC would not be a
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be a way to grow plants,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they always have too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about too much water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about oxygenated water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so cocoa can be watered almost
constantly because it maintains adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're watering it, you know,
frequently a lot of the oxygen itself
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from the dissolved oxygen in the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to keep your water,
if you're depending on that, below 70
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually like to keep my water right
at like 68 degrees Fahrenheit because
[SPEAKER_01]: above 70, there's not the ability of water
to hold dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically drops off a cliff at about 70
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at 68, water can hold a lot of
dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 72, it can hold almost none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really helps to sort of think about
that in terms of water temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also, if you're ever running a rez
with these systems to keep the rez cooler,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if it gets above 70 degrees
Fahrenheit, the oxygen levels drop and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when you start to grow bacteria in
your tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to have to do cleaning
more frequently and all the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a watering system or a tank
that you have to clean all the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: get it a little bit colder, drop it below
70 degrees, and you'll sort of resolve
[SPEAKER_01]: those issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could probably ramble on for a few more
minutes, but I think we did cover a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the key points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I got a lot of other
resources and articles, videos on this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in more of that,
I invite you to come and check out our
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we touch upon a lot, you know,
growing in cocoa, using synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think we could even do another
episode in the future at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa and organics or even cocoa and
synganic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people are mixing the two
and growing the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe we could do something like
that in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the synganic mood is like,
I'm going to take what makes sense from
[SPEAKER_01]: different things and apply them to my
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that style of growing where,
you know, you think through things and you
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what makes sense as opposed to
just going with something because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: label that it has or thinking that it's
safe or not safe because of the label that
[SPEAKER_01]: it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I endorse and sort of identify with
that style.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys tuning into this want to see
that talk, definitely comment below and
[SPEAKER_00]: let us know you want to see a part two on
cocoa and we can definitely get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Final words.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you have anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I have a YouTube channel,
Dr. MJ Coco on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some videos like we mentioned about
cocoa and growing cocoa like my
[SPEAKER_01]: germination tutorial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of grow light reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next time that we come on,
we'll talk about horticultural lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of what we're interested in in
horticultural lighting, how to compare,
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate different lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll find a lot of that kind of
content on my YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also run the website, CocoaForCannabis
.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where you'll be able to find my
articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a big community.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do grow challenges, which are basically
collaborative grow alongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we're in the middle of the new
year grow challenge, which started on
[SPEAKER_01]: January 1st and a few hundred growers
growing together in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also find all my grow light reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything else there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also on Instagram and do some things
there, but I do some other podcasts and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, check out my YouTube channel and
come visit us.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely have a link to YouTube
channel down in the YouTube video
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below so you can
easily get to his channel and stay tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: for next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next week, he's going to be on again,
Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to talk about LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are the present and the future of
horticultural lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really sort of no question about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garers sometimes hit me up with questions
about like, well, something else is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to come next or some new technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, maybe, but LEDs are already
about 90% efficient in terms of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: transfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to see sort of how another
technology could come along and be much
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty phenomenal in terms of sort
of how LEDs themselves work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think understanding a bit more about
them can really help growers become better
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of consumers of grow light fixtures
on the market, too, because I think a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of manufacturers are taking advantage of
the fact that growers don't know a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about indoor lighting for horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so manufacturers are able to sort of
manipulate growers and try to convince
[SPEAKER_01]: them of a bunch of BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been happening for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my big passion there is to try to arm
growers with sort of the knowledge that
[SPEAKER_01]: they need so they're not sold a bill of
goods, so that they actually can go out
[SPEAKER_01]: there and evaluate grow lights and make
good product decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I definitely look forward to
getting into that and talking about how to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluate what we're looking for,
why LEDs are, I say, the future of
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural lighting, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited about that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for that one as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look forward to that next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: As always, hit the thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend, I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love for you to tune in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. MJ Coco, once again, thanks so much
for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't wait for that talk next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow a lot, everyone.
