[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you're that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Vivo Sun 315 watt CMH grow
light and in this video I'm going to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: power test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the Apogee MQ500 power
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing this so you can get a
general idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurements are taken in a grow tent so
the reflective material could increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: power output so keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also this light has a flowering coverage
area of 3 foot by 3 foot and this is a 4
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by 4 foot grow tent so I'm not going
to be going all the way to the corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to try to keep it in a 3 foot by
3 foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances 12 inches 24 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: and 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are pretty standard distances for
CMH grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other power test videos
I do I will let the measurements do the
[SPEAKER_00]: talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about these
measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: A link to this grow light is in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have more power test videos coming
out here soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you want to see next?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Green Sunshine Company's ES300,
the Solar Extreme 500 by California
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightworks and I also have the Sun System
315 watt CMH grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
