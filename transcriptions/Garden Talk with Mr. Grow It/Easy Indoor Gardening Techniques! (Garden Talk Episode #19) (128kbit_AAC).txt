[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get switched to flour,
the day of flour, no matter when they got
[SPEAKER_00]: switched, no matter how long ago they got
vegetative nutrients, I give them two
[SPEAKER_00]: tablespoons per gallon of 484,
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nematodes work really well, too,
but you have to be diligent with them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well and keep dosing them because they
still come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fungus gnats, their fungus gnats come
back so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get very equal results from topping the
low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is, is that low stress is
less stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that even topping the
plant can stress it out and they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, all these videos, this dude
told me it was the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody say that way is the best
way, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way you're gonna know is just to
go ahead and do it and figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are here with Mr. Good Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on, Mr. Grow It?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the audience ought to
know how long we've been trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I was going to say, when we finally
did it, you can go ahead and talk crap
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's been a long road trying to go
from doing what I normally do to doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to get my stuff together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it took us a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I had like four or five people
request you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been telling people, I'm like,
we're trying to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finally, we get to sit down,
get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get it out there for the people
that want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm cool to hear that people request me on
your platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you've been out doing it a lot
longer than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that made me feel real good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll make sure everything is up to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking good on your platform,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you have a real large following,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got like almost, you're about to
have 20,000 people following you on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube, which is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there's got to be some
people in my audience that don't know who
[SPEAKER_01]: you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself, kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into gardening was a long journey
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started wanting to grow probably about
eight years before I actually started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during that time, I was living in a
house where the basement was all screwed
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Detroit and in my old house,
a lot of Detroit houses had problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: flooding basements and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to start then and I literally
built an entire growth like out of two by
[SPEAKER_00]: fours and black plastic and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the basement flooded, destroyed all
of it, had plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It destroyed the plants and it was all
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my first attempt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from that point on, I literally was
so obsessed with growing that I researched
[SPEAKER_00]: it nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: For like five years straight after that,
until I finally moved into the house I was
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny because once I moved,
I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one day I was over at my boy
house and I still had these same seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AK-47 seeds, the first seeds I grew on
my first growth, my first season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had those seeds literally eight years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had those seeds for eight, almost five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, I had them for like six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had them for five years and then I
stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I moved, I forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went over to my boy house who had
been growing and it was about the time to
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing right when my first AK-47
season had started, my first YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he asked me, he was like, how come you
ain't started trying to grow yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was like, it's that season now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do still got those seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, I'm gonna go ahead and
drop them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was growing outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to grow outside that time,
that particular time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you watch my OCs, you can actually
follow everything I'm saying, cause I
[SPEAKER_00]: started it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got like a super crazy rain and
then just like, I came home one day and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the plants was tilted over and it was
all laying down and the dirt was falling
[SPEAKER_00]: out the cups and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I moved it all inside and I just
started going from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day, the same guy told me,
he was like, how come you don't record
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and then make videos for
YouTube for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I had been doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I've been recording it for
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I literally, in my first video,
I took every clip I recorded, not making
[SPEAKER_00]: it for YouTube, but I just took the clips
I recorded for myself and made my first
[SPEAKER_00]: video out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've just been doing it ever since
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been a pretty cool journey since
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just had that one outdoor season or
one outdoor period, and then you brought
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors and you've been indoor,
is there a percent?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a week outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do outdoor grow right now,
but yeah, I was like a week outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It scared me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It scared me too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just bought it inside and got a tent
and started from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you mostly growing auto flowers or
photo periods or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: At first I was growing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me a lot of fear out what I really
liked the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this point I can say for sure that
I like, I prefer photo periods,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do grow auto flowers and I had a lot
of recommendations for auto flowers that
[SPEAKER_00]: people like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had, I've grown a lot of great
auto flowers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do, I do like them both, but for me
personally and the amount of space that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have, I prefer doing photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been sticking to that mostly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I had more, more space,
I would grow everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into breeding and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to start making some feminized
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, you know, I've seen some of
your indoor grows on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I know she really liked to
do is you like to keep things simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like to make things easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have kind of a more laid back,
hands off approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what I want to get into here
in this podcast is ways to make things
[SPEAKER_01]: easy, simple techniques that you do,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to get into the questions
that I sent you several weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're first trying to plan this out and
we'll go through your grow style and we'll
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about some of the things you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for indoors, what size grow space are
you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have three tins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in a two, four by fours and a three
by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the four by four the most for my
photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfect for what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep four or seven gallon pots
flowering like towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my tins is just a veg tent,
which is, well, I don't know if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see, this is the flower tent, but right
next to it is the veg tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I veg plants out in there and then
flip them and flower right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing that with my other
tent too, but my other tent was mainly the
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly, but yeah, four by four mainly is
my favorite space so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm in a very tight space as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to get in bigger,
bigger spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm similar to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got small area to work with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just got, right now I just got one
four by four and one two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually running smaller than what
you got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for, for lighting for
the three tins?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got, all Mars are the lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got, right now I got in the three by
three, I have an FC 4,800.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't run it at full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run it at about, I run it at about 400
watts during the peak of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty, it's pretty, it's built for a
four by four, but I like to go by,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this, I got this from Mr. Canucks
too, that you go off for 35 watts per
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had great success with it since I
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been sticking with that ever since
I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go strictly off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other four by four, I have a TS
3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I like to have like around 600 watts
per, 600 watts, true watts from the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also have the other four by
four, I have two SP 3000s currently right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and they're both running at 300
watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 600 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to keep them around the same
thing at 35 watts per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science behind it, I'm not completely
sure about, but I've had wonderful success
[SPEAKER_00]: with it and I've done less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had, I've had less success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking that's a sweet spot for
what we're trying to go for here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had my hands on the SP 3000,
two of them in a full bat four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a part test on it and it looks like
it rocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's cool to see you running
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I was doing the part test,
I'm like, man, if anybody's running two of
[SPEAKER_01]: those, it's going to be working real good
for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my hands on the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: The SCS 3002, I thought that was pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the FC 4800, that's one of the
newer ones, right, that they released.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bar style one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The FC 4800 is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually with the bar style lights that it
has, I have really good light penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first time I used it was with some
very small clones that turned out really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buzz, I grew OG because a lot of times
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one time I grew it, starting with
very small clones underneath the 4800,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really nice size buzz,
really dense buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, I actually really liked
that light for that first run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to stick with it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the detachable ones too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually going to be putting the
6500 in the other four bar four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm liking the bar style lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that that allows a greater
penetration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to experiment more with it to
see how the results we can get from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it definitely helps with the light
spread across the footprint, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that even light spread.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I personally like about
those bar style lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like with the bar style light 6600 when
you can dim them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're not running CO2, you don't
need to have these things at full power,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're frying plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you running CO2 or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a million kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of my things about trying to
keep everything simple because they keep
[SPEAKER_00]: me really busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a wife and they keep me really busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a world where I want to grow,
but I'm going to make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to keep things simple as possible
so that I can maintain and get good
[SPEAKER_00]: results while still being distracted by
everything else in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of that, I don't use CO2 because I
have so many people in the house that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's plenty of carbon dioxide flowing
around in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids are always up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got millions of nephews and I got
cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got plenty of carbon dioxide in the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't supplement it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it once and I didn't notice
anything different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that was because I already
got a decent amount of CO2 in the house
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have people living in the same
house where you're growing in,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to be enough CO2 for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume you do some sort of air exchange
in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have inline fans that you're kind
of exhausting out of there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all I have is just the
exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run an exhaust fan in each tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about the smell as
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I just realized that I probably
should use carbon filters because the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying nutrients smell really bad when you
water them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just realized recently that I should use
carbon filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got three exhaust fans in each one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any intake fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I allow my vents to stay open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave a vent or two on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger tents, I leave two vents open.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my three by three, I just leave one
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: That takes care of the intake of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air has to be replaced as the air has
been exhausted out of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I exhaust the air right into my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people like to exhaust it
out of the room completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't able to do that in the situation
that I'm in because my room is in an attic
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a weird room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just exhaust everything right into the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had no problems with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: One exhaust fan, then one air to circulate
the air inside the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must smell amazing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plants are flowering,
it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to leave the house and then come
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, oh my God!
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells wonderful in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get used to it while you're here all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been running carbon filters
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good thing to bring up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an optional piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't need to hide a smell,
you don't need that piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't need to hide a smell,
don't even buy the equipment ceremony
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my neighbors probably can smell
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Late flowering, you know how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when you're drying, they can even
smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drying would be something different
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when they transform and they get a
lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of little danker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had so many FedEx drivers and UPS
drivers just like, oh, smells good in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's continue to talk about environment a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you usually aim for when it comes
to temps?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another thing when it comes to
keeping everything simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, like when I get into a facility,
I would like to have different temps and
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges for vegetative and flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being all in one room and not being able
to do that and having to have everything
[SPEAKER_00]: up here to keep it safe for my family,
everything pretty much runs at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and the same humidity all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I can control and I can
keep a difference in is the drying tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I like to keep it at 65% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the room, I'm pretty much at the
mercy of whatever the season is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's winter time outside, then the
humidity in here is nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no humidity in the air in here
because it gets extremely dry in the
[SPEAKER_00]: wintertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried raising the humidity in my veg
tents and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just impossible in this room.
[SPEAKER_00]: This room is horribly insulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then vice versa, in the summertime,
the humidity is super high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of different in the summer
because the air conditioner helps lower
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep the humidity around 40,
50-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about as low as I can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't bother the plants and flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had really any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, my veg plants that were used,
because I had a humidifier that I ran in
[SPEAKER_00]: the veg tent for a while, but I was
literally refilling it every few hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: which drove me crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, y'all just not going to have any
humidity because I can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't keep up with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: During that particular growth,
they adjusted to it, which I learned that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants will adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even my clones, I don't have a dome over
my clones either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have a problem with that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty relentless guys there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't answer the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature, I do have great control
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always keep the temperature around 75 in
the room, period, with the air conditioner
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer and the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to keep it around 75,
70-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a few times that it's gotten super
high being in the attic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a fight to keep it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I ask the laws I could ever get
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity though, I can't control the
humidity at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring up a great point is you don't
really have to have the optimal humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: that is widely set online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be in this range for veg,
this range for flour, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with lower than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be optimal growth,
but the plant will still grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is resilient, like you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are trying to keep it simple,
if you're on a budget or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can probably get away with not having
some of this equipment and not regulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now people could probably argue about the
overall final quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a fair view on that,
but the plant will still grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: still usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be detrimental to your
growth until you have nothing to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people get hung up on a lot,
which is something for me starting off is
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into learning about growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody makes it an extremely big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not doing this, then your stuff
is trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get discouraged by that,
but we're growing it for ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had to tell myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was done, I was happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it wasn't as great as my first
time when I got done with my first growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't the greatest I ever had,
but I was happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was satisfying to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I had to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, man, it may not be the best of
the best, but I'm not trying to sell this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to appease my own
pastimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that people need to think about
what's good for them and just do it and
[SPEAKER_00]: see how you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get hung up on it being the best
ever or somebody tell you that's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: biggest or it doesn't smell good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it and see how you like it for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be satisfied for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to do as much or work as hard
as you need to work so that you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important that
people remember that they're doing it for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You even had a grow I saw on your YouTube
channel where 10 went up to 106.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still got a final product out of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was amazing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another thing that showed me just
listening to everybody else with things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that happening, I started panicking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I panicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you how hot it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I opened the door to my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a sauna.
[SPEAKER_00]: I instantly started sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, the aroma from the room was
so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cooked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like they got cooked in the heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally panicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through here, opened the window,
fanning them out, opened the tents all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took them out of the bars and left them
open all night.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants was all droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were hurt from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I panicked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally thought that that harvest was
going to be for nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have never knew that that
happened to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you were able to get stuff out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of my scariest times
since I've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about what medium you grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in soil, cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't do DWC or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use rooster organic soil, which is
mostly cocoa and peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not actually soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is partially soil, but it's
mostly cocoa and peat moss and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of perlite too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it once and I had great results with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants all love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know much about dirt
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently went to the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of guys walking out with
bales of ProMix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asking the guy about the ProMix.
[SPEAKER_00]: He confused the crap out of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you complicate stuff so much,
I was like, he said, you got to do this
[SPEAKER_00]: and then mix this down and then put some
of this in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to get through this
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not about to do any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about mixing this,
basically making his own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people do, but it was just
like, I was just about to get the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought y'all were just growing in the
ProMix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the roots organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown in it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have nutrients already in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real heavy in vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too bad too that it'll burn the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I go right in the flower
and I use that, I'll mix flower nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: directly in it and it has no issues with
that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the perfect mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used Fox Farm soil the very first
time I tried to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually was burning my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the plants, all my seedlings,
they all came out kind of burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were fine and they were still
growing, but they came out looking kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know why then, but now I'm
thinking it was because the soil was too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I primarily use the Fox Farm soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you leave the soil out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be more breakdown and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a few problems, but very,
very few problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very rare to have problems with the Fox
Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me, but I have heard of people
not having good experiences with that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that the roots organic has
nutrients, so you're probably not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of feeding for the first 30,
40 days, depending on how much you're
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it kind of easy, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you start off in a small container and
then work your way up to that seven gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: that you spoke about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with the photos, I always start
off in a solo cup coming from our decloner
[SPEAKER_00]: going to a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally stay in the solo cup
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got plants that'd be three feet tall in
a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally put nutrients in the solo cup
and just put it right on top of the water
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'd be so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in the solo cup and I try to go
into one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to go in between a one gallon
before I go into the seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go from the solo to a one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: After it just looks like it's dying off,
then I keep it in a one gallon to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, I just read a man every 30
days, but if I'm not flipping the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything like that, I'll read me some
dry nutrients, but every 30 days with the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, I'm not feeding at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the water around 6.5 to 6.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just plain pH water the first 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that 30 days, if they're going into
a flower or they're going into another
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, if they're getting transplanted,
they don't get fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I try to keep everything around
those same time periods too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's around that time period of
transplant, then I'll wait it all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when I transplant, they can go
another 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I try to keep it right around.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to go in the flower, which I
still have to feed them, but if they go in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower, I still try to keep it right
at that 30 day limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they ate all those vegetative
nutrients and they was ready for new
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really ever only have to feed mostly
flower nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I barely ever use my vegetative dry
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which nutrients are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use down to earth dry nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only use a few of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: 444, the 484, rose and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I use the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use bone meal as a halfway through
flower boost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 3 and 15 phosphorus and zero
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use those in my lime every once in a
while too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just those four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fully organic then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I'm really big on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't agree with chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly because of my hair too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things I do with my body,
I don't use any type of chemicals in my
[SPEAKER_00]: hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't eat chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use things with petroleum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I carry that over into growing the plants
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to stay away from chemicals and
just try to keep it completely organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that you can get from the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also heavy on apocalyptic situations
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I want to still be able to do this
after apocalypse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to look up a lot of ways to get
natural nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural phosphorus and potassium and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep everything organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people, down to earth is
very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually know a lot of people that are
looking for instructions on how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't give very good clear
instructions on how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just mention a little bit more how
you apply that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said with the dirt, every 30 days
if I do need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're going to get the vegetarian
nutrients then I'll do two tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per gallon of the vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Per gallon pot that they're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they're in a five gallon pot then
they'll get 10 tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be every 30 days if they're going
to stay in that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they get switched to flour,
the day of flour, no matter when they got
[SPEAKER_00]: switched, no matter how long ago they got
vegetative nutrients, I give them two
[SPEAKER_00]: tablespoons per gallon of 484,
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then halfway through flour, like maybe
late week four, early week four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, I'll give them 75% 484 and then I'll
give them 25% bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically they're still getting the
two tablespoons per gallon no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll add that up and then I'll break
it down to 75% of the 484 and then 25%
[SPEAKER_00]: bone meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if it was a five gallon pot and I
was doing two tablespoons per gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would get seven and a half
tablespoons of the 484 and then they would
[SPEAKER_00]: get two and a half tablespoons of the bone
meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they still got the exact same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to give them a little boost at
the end of the second half of the flour
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you also do microbes too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You inoculate with microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're using recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using anything other than recharge
or just recharge and how do you apply the
[SPEAKER_01]: recharge?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off using Russo Organic Organism
XL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started to recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason, they're both exactly the
same for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They both recharge didn't do any better
than Organism XL.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only difference was, that was very
important, is that that Organism XL clumps
[SPEAKER_00]: and it gets really hard and it turns into
these rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically it takes you half the
time trying to break it down so that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can feed it to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the recharge doesn't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stays in that powdery form the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the micros are extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that having a good micro life in
the soil, however you put it,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology, living with the soil,
living with those micros in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: is very important for breaking down the
organic, having the organic nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works hand in hand with the dry
nutrients though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, that's my, that's the only
thing I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those dry nutrients and the recharge
micros once a week and some PAs water and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And talking about microbes, it's,
you know, we're talking about making
[SPEAKER_01]: things easy, maybe saving some money,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes, you know, when you're growing
the organic side, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might not be something that you
kind of want to skimp out on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to get a lot better
results if you do have those microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's a good call out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So recharge using just in flowering or
using throughout the whole grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's most important for me in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure I never miss a feeding of
recharge in flower, but I do use it the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes I'm a little more relaxed
about using it in veg, just because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not, the veg plants kind of grow,
like veg is veg, veg time is time for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to heal themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to recover and like,
like it's a, it's a more of a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: relaxing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there is, it's like, once you get
into flower, it's like a race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, like then during that time,
they, I make sure they get a recharge
[SPEAKER_00]: every week on, on the diet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no missing, no recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy cause I like, it works
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can see, it says it on the bag,
like noticeably you'll notice the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do, like you do, they'd be really
happy like the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not having the microbes in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're working with a quality
bag of soil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It already has those microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes in there to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be enough for the first 30,
40 days or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, keeping it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, just inoculating the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about plant training?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about, what do you typically do
for plant training throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the plants, plant training,
depending on what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that with the photo periods,
this is all in keeping it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, topping and low stress
training, I get very equal results from
[SPEAKER_00]: topping and low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is, is that low stress is
less stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed that even topping the
plant can stress it out and they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you got more than one
topping, you topping all the tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can stress the plant out and get
droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't, I don't like to,
I don't like to top all the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little lot of people say all the
flowers, they don't want to stress them
[SPEAKER_00]: out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I strictly train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is because I've noticed stress
from, from topping a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I've broken the entire
top off of an auto flower and it still is
[SPEAKER_00]: my second highest yielded plant from that
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't always know, but I try to stay
away from, from stressing out the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flower as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But topping is way easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really easy just to top a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then having to pull all these plant ties
and bending the plant over, trying not to
[SPEAKER_00]: break it, tying it down like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be a lot more work than just
pinching off the top and being done with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the photos, I just strictly top
the photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really do too much anything else
unless one of them starts to grow too much
[SPEAKER_00]: farther, too much taller than the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll do some super cropping just to
bend it down and bring it back down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: same level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I strictly just top my photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I top them like three or four times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I top it once at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it gets to two tops, I top both of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I let it grow all the four tops and I
top off four of those tops and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, it bushes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I usually get it, it's usually about
time to get it under the scrawl net for
[SPEAKER_00]: the photo period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about all I do for the photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they get big enough in the four by
four, I do use a scrawl net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will utilize a scrawl net because it
does help with light penetration and
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing the yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that when you spread those plants
out, they will replace tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've been to the top now,
it will replace it with two more tops,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you're not pinching them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you remove a top out the way,
it'll allow another top to grow to where
[SPEAKER_00]: that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to take that scrawl net and bend
down all those main tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's always a bunch of small leaves,
small tops that's right at the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: scrawl.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a couple of weeks, when those other
tops are bent over, as those grow back up,
[SPEAKER_00]: those small tops grew up as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then now you've got a whole bunch more
tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use the three-inch scrawl net
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, once I fill that up and I
try to strategically ... Sometimes though,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have recently gotten away from trying to
fill up every single square.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big deal for me at first,
but I found that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filling up every single square versus not
every square, but getting most of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really suffered my yield too
much, so I just try to keep the work easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, I put a six-inch square scrawl
net on just to hold them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low stress training is so much work
because they grow out of it so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll low stress train them and then come
back the next day and they've all grown
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even had plants rip out of the tires.
[SPEAKER_00]: You literally have to keep tying them down
every single day and they just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an everyday thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to stay away from low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I try to stay away from
autofly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know how autofly is kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in those things, just talking like
that, it makes it a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a similar technique for topping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do the main top, then I'll top those
tops, and then I'll top again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight main colors or 16 main colors,
depending on how many times you top.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I've challenged myself to do
when it comes to low stress training,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I like to do the topping and then
do low stress training along with it to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to keep the canopy even at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to fly going after you right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I'm bending them down doing low stress
training, I'm challenging myself more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more to just bend with my hands and then
use no ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually been getting away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just bending it now, yes, it's going to be
beneficial to get in there twice a day and
[SPEAKER_01]: do the hand bending.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get away with it once a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not have as much good of a
canopy just doing it once a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's definitely possible to get away
with low stress training without ties for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I know you do some defoliation too,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You pluck up some leaves every now and
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you usually do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Defoliation is very important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: With autos and follow-up periods,
I defoliate all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, I used to not defoliate
all the flowers barely at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my grows, I particularly did it on
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it in my normal defoliation because
I don't do too much defoliation period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still always with photos or autos,
I'm still very selective about it just to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the top sides uncovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my autos grows, I actually
particularly just went ahead and just was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I'm just going to defoliate like I
normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no issues out of it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I defoliate all my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep the big families.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once all the families get really big,
I take them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they start getting the granddaddy
families, those huge families,
[SPEAKER_00]: I take those off for the ones that have
been there from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to keep the huge ones going.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular size families that they grow,
they grow new families and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they grow tops, then they grow new
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the new tops to keep their
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant gets older, I take the old
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let it develop new families.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets bigger and bushes out,
as those older families that's super huge
[SPEAKER_00]: and those tops got really long,
I take all those old families again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep doing that same routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that to the auto flowers too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have no issues out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am defoliating, particularly within the
first three weeks of flowers when I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: pluck off the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after the stretching period,
once they're done stretching, the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: fatten up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to pluck off leaves during
that time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get away with it, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then sometimes towards the very end of
flowering, day 45 of flowering,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a week before, two weeks before
harvest, I'll get in there and I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliation on the middle of the canopy so
I can get down in.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps with the finishing in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I do there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up and talk about pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do anything at all to prevent
pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you got a housefly running around
there and you've got your grow tent right
[SPEAKER_01]: behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do to prevent pests,
if anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through a lot of different things
with the pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neem oil works really great,
but it smells horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really strong smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really good, but it fill your
entire house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your whole house will smell like neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't use it during flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got away from neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started using mosquito bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosquito bits work pretty well,
but not great for spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had fungus nets a million times and
I've only had spider mites once.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neem oil spray worked okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked great for the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It worked great for the spider mites and
the fungus nets while I was in viz.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really much I could do for them
once it was in flower and they still came
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I got away from doing that,
then I started using the mosquito dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The skill dunks didn't do anything at all
obviously for spider mites, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: worked good for a little bit for fungus
nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still kept coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus nets are relentless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started getting into using
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nematodes work really well too,
but you have to be diligent with them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well and keep dosing them because they
still come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus nets come back so easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then these damn flies too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep fly traps up in an easy
grow tent too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know where all these flies came
from just today because they all came
[SPEAKER_00]: today to bother me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went and got some more sticky
traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to keep the sticky traps up too
just so that it alerts you to what you got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really notice the fungus nets
until you come to water the plants and you
[SPEAKER_00]: water them and then the fungus nets get to
flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to come in every day and just take
a look at the sticky traps and see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll know that you got other
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had spider mites again since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been pretty blessed with the pests
except for the fungus nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to mention the yellow stickies
because I've seen those in your videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to keep things simple, putting just
sticky traps up is kind of an easy thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can do in order to help catch the
fungus nets so you can kind of see and
[SPEAKER_01]: then take action from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're growing organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medium needs to be moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no surprise that fungus nets will
come at you a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thrive in that wet medium on that top
layer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having those sticky traps there are so
key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, they could just invade so
quickly and then before you know it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get that fungus nets damage on the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The yellowing in the leaves and those
circle spots, the rust spots, just all the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and then you know you have fungus
nets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really bad, really out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those yellow sticky traps are an easy way
to at least catch, to identify and also
[SPEAKER_01]: helps remove some of them because they're
getting trapped into dying there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're kind of flipping things
around here, kind of getting all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: One other thing I wanted to talk about
was, I think that I saw in your video,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not on the list of questions that I
gave you, but I figured it would be good
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring up here because I thought it was
pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: After you harvest, you do your trimming or
whatever and you're putting it into
[SPEAKER_01]: actually a vacuum seal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to me a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said you had a lot of success doing
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I discovered
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't explain exactly how I discovered
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I needed to figure out how the
product was going to be after being vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: sealed for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was how I don't normally do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happened to just do it this one
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I did what I did, I just wanted to
make sure that it wasn't going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: destroyed afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to check.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I did what I did, I took some more of
the plants and I vacuum sealed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I left it in there until the other
thing that I was doing was ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I came back to check to see how it
turned out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually experimented with two ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bud and put it inside of a
regular Mylar bag and sealed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I actually vacuum sealed some of it
inside of a vacuum seal and sucked all the
[SPEAKER_00]: air out and then sealed it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Detroit, we got this stuff that a lot
of people like to call exotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the way that they do it is more
so chemicals and stuff that they give it
[SPEAKER_00]: this really tight look and there's really
strong smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: After this week was up, and I opened this
pet, I was completely blown away because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like, oh my God, it turned to exotics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It literally got really tight and then the
smell was extremely strong and I opened it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I was just like, what did I just
do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I harvested another plant and I did
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you letting them dry?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're harvesting and then letting them
dry then trimming or are you just trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: and then going right to it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim it and then I put it in a jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I leave it in a jar for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it cure normally before a week just
because it'd still be kind of soft still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I'd be scared to do it right
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's going to just crush it
completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it cure regular for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I go to the vacuum seal and I just
squish and make sure it's ... It got to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with a good material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Material need to be a decently dense
material already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to do it with ... I've had an
auto that didn't grow as great and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried that and it did not work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even after letting it cure for a week,
it still crushed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has to be a decent plant that's a
decent density that can withstand the
[SPEAKER_00]: strength of it being squashed like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a week regularly curing the jar,
put it in the vacuum seal and I only do it
[SPEAKER_00]: for one week, literally only one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to compact it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does something to the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like it traps everything
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you open it up, it never loses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that week, I break it all down like
how it was and then I put it back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: jar and I continue curing just like
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It continues to cure normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do it for the look and that smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just boosts the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie and say that it makes
it smoke any better because it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes just as great either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the appeal, it definitely does
something for the appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in my city, a lot of people are
looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even sure if that's how they do it
or not because it seems like that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been doing it because it literally
did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that ever since,
just one week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacuum seal a week and then back to the
jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine the video that you showed,
it looked like it was tightening up those
[SPEAKER_01]: buds quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as bag of the eye, it makes total
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was interesting for you to
bring that up on here in case anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: either wanted to know that as a tip or if
maybe some people are already doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: and they already know about that,
but it's not something that we normally
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find no information on it
myself either.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those things that I had to
come up with that little routine myself
[SPEAKER_00]: because I researched it hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I did that that one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: How should I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I go straight from the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I trim?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long should I dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long should I leave it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find no information on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was something I just had to experiment
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, if anybody wants to do what
I did, I'll explain one more time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim, cure regularly in the jar for a
week, vacuum seal, leave it vacuum seal
[SPEAKER_00]: for a week, and go back to a jar for the
remand or the curing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I know that most of your following,
there was a lot of followers of yours that
[SPEAKER_01]: are beginners and they're following.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a great job with kind of explaining
things step-by-step on your channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, you probably get a ton of
questions from beginners, so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for people who are
just starting out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Advice I have for people that are just
starting out is go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jump into it and get your first growth
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spend a lot of time confusing myself and
harping over how I should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I doing it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into growing is so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is so hard and so frustrating to get
some type of solid information that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to make you comfortable enough to
pull the trigger on what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never be comfortable enough with
the information that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I learned from that is just to do it
and learn from doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff about the way that my
channel is is because a lot of that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: was hard for me to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of information that was hard to come
across from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started, I was trying to
build an ebb and flow table.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had me trying to build an ebb and
flow table for flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had me trying to build a draining
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them was going to be an ebb and
flow where it would flood the whole table
[SPEAKER_00]: and then drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was like a dripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The very system was like a dripper system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had all these leads and this water pump
and all this stuff that the guy was
[SPEAKER_00]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched all these videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: This dude told me it was the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody say that way is the best way
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way for you to know is just to go
ahead and do it and figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable for yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nobody that's going to be able to
tell you what's comfortable and what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to say it's the best way,
but it may not be the best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get too caught up on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live my life that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just jump into it and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learn from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different ways to grow
and it can become so overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like just do it, try it, do what you
think best, adjust, go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single part of growing is a million
different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never be satisfied.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so wrapping things up,
where can the listeners find you and what
[SPEAKER_01]: do you got up coming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still trying to open this
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Detroit right now is being sued,
which is a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're being sued for basically trying to
have this program for low income people,
[SPEAKER_00]: for people who aren't low income that
don't qualify for being sued for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dispensary may not end up in Detroit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there will be a GoodBuzz Wellness
Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to give up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be in Detroit, but it will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to holler at me, you already
know to follow me on YouTube, MrGoodBuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep up with me on Instagram and
see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: MrGoodBuzz on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Facebook and Twitter as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All MrGoodBuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just type in MrGoodBuzz on
anything and you can look me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might even start a TikTok grow channel
too and just do some quick little grow
[SPEAKER_00]: things on TikTok.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been seeing some stuff like that
lately too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might get on there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have a TikTok page, MrGoodBuzz
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all going to holler at me there as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for those on YouTube, I will link
his YouTube channel down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below so you can go
down there and click on it to get to his
[SPEAKER_01]: channel real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him a sub, show him some love over
there in the comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much for coming on, MrGoodBuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad we got to finally do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was a great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you being patient with me
too, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through hell trying to get this
going, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Y'all didn't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was waiting one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know what, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do it no more.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I was going to beg you
like, man, please, man, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate that though, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got it done for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I will let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate y'all, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
Peace.
