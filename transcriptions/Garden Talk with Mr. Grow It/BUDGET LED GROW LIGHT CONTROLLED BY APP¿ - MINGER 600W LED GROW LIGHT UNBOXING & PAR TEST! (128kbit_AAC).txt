[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, feel that don't know
me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grud and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Minger 600 watt LED grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased this grow light off of Amazon
at a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I am going to unbox the
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do a quick walkthrough of the app
that is used to control the light and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: test the power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out of the box is the antenna.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the product listing page,
the Bluetooth range is 15 meters,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is about 49 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next out the box is a power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is six feet long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a set of wire hangers and a
user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't go over all the features in this
video, but I will leave a link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below so you can click
on it and you can learn about all the
[SPEAKER_00]: details on this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've hung the light on one side of a two
foot by four foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, the wire hanging kit that
comes with this grow light is a single
[SPEAKER_00]: style hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This results in difficulty in hanging the
grow light straight, so I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: picking up a pair of light ratchet
hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can do what I've done here,
which is remove the hook that comes with
[SPEAKER_00]: it and connect the wire hangers directly
to the light ratchets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it much easier to hang the grow
light straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do a quick walkthrough of the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the app is Gove Home and it is
available on Android and iOS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get into the app, click the icon
on the top right corner and you can add in
[SPEAKER_00]: the device.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually already added in the device
as you can see here, so I'll tap on this
[SPEAKER_00]: device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a few seconds to connect to the
grow light and then this is what you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually set two different timers
and then you have the option of three
[SPEAKER_00]: different spectrums.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to enable the timers,
you would tap the slider and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: would tap the time spots and adjust the on
and off times.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the spectrums, they have three
different options, 4, 1, 6, 1,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 8, 1, and the manufacturer recommends
these different spectrums for different
[SPEAKER_00]: growing stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the unit into my kilowatt
meter just to see what the wattage draw is
[SPEAKER_00]: on this unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 4, 1 setting, it pulls about 106,
107 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the 6, 1 setting, it pulls 98 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the 8, 1 setting, it pulls 94
watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's jump into the power
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the Apogee MQ500 power meter and
this meter measures from 389 nanometers to
[SPEAKER_00]: 692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any light being emitted
outside of that range, it won't be shown
[SPEAKER_00]: on this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just to give you a general
idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't meant to be exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflective walls in this grow tent
could increase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't say what the coverage area is
for this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, from my experience, this size
grow light is best for a 2 foot by 2 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, I've hung this
light on one side of a 2 foot by 4 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent and I'll try to keep my power
meter within a 2 foot by 2 foot grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, I'll let the measurements do the
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
