[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk, you know,
you really have to be ruthless and
[SPEAKER_00]: Deciding you know, what's gonna make it
what's gonna move forward and I'd rather
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut the plant down and not deal with bugs
in my greenhouse if you have high nitrate
[SPEAKER_00]: levels in your plant material You're very
susceptible to pest pressure Do not change
[SPEAKER_00]: labs because all their machines are
different all of their calibration is
[SPEAKER_00]: different trying to compare two results
from two different labs You're gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: a very bad time employ some of this
science and you'll really be able to See
[SPEAKER_00]: and and have you know recordable data next
to what you're seeing tissue testing sap
[SPEAKER_00]: testing soil testing The whole reason I'm
doing all of that is so I don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: fight pests at the end Sap testing has
really opened up a new level of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the cheat codes for growers for
sure What's up everybody feel that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know me my name is Chris aka mr Grote and
you're tuned into the Garden Talk Podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode number 42 in this episode
interview Tyler Platt from grassroots
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric pots He has been gardening for 10
years and he grows a variety of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: such as aloe vera chia Apples various
vegetables and medicinal plants in this
[SPEAKER_01]: episode Tyler talks about various testing
processes such as sap testing soil testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and tissue testing He also talks about the
outdoor and greenhouse operation that he's
[SPEAKER_01]: worked in Thanks to all of you who support

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the garden talk podcast today
and join with Tyler Platt from grassroots
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me on here I
really love chatting with you whenever get
[SPEAKER_01]: a chance to this is gonna be fun Yeah,
so we known each other from MJ biz con I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's what we met back and I want
to say 2017 I believe is when we first met
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's a long time ago and then we saw
each other a couple months ago a month ago
[SPEAKER_01]: at MJ biz con and Figured we'd do a
podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have extensive amount of knowledge in
so many different areas today We're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be talking about tissue testing sap
testing soil testing and then we'll hear
[SPEAKER_01]: if we have time We might talk a little bit
about your outdoor greenhouse operation
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've been working in So super
excited for this one But before we get
[SPEAKER_01]: deep into the whole testing side of things
the various ways to test Can you give us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us about yourself and how you got
into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 32 years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been cultivating to Northern
California for a little over 10 years The
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning five years definitely wasn't as
successful as like the most current five
[SPEAKER_00]: years but Been working for grassroots for
the last six years and honestly have had a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of customers just pouring into me what
works great for them and that just the
[SPEAKER_00]: Success they have and using our products
or using other products similar to ours So
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been taking all those cool tips and
just putting them to practical use of my
[SPEAKER_00]: own personal garden and trying to Get down
to the possible best quality I can get to
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know one day I'd love to enter
into some competitions later on down the
[SPEAKER_00]: road and they come back on and really show
what I can do Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's your overall growth style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say I mean your indoor outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow in soil cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you synthetic organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your growth style?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Mean, I've tried them pretty much all
separate deep water culture But I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly I'm very very comfortable
outdoors Preferably in a greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have its cover on it And then we
put our cover on a little bit later in the
[SPEAKER_00]: season To really benefit towards the
flowering, but we're obviously in the
[SPEAKER_00]: foothills So we have a low amount of
electricity some of its on solar power So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I can't keep my greenhouse cover
on all year and pay for all of those fans
[SPEAKER_00]: or even be able to have Power to move all
those fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't have a cover on our greenhouse
most of the season So it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor and then we would get down to you
know that kind of season Where we got to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep things going and get to get the
flowered really pushing forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll put the cover on It's a poly we've
covered that's 12 millimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just some basic plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are throwing on So outdoor
organic living soil, I've been in the same
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for four years now and I've just
constantly been seeing improvements
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm not counting on bro science
I'm using actual science to amend my bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha Gotcha and that kind of wraps right
into what we're going to talk about first,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is soil testing So I assume you've
done soil testing on the bed that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: been using for four plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is soil testing and why do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know soil testing is really something
you should use to take the weight off of
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoulders To know what you've put
together is going to go forward in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right direction Growing, you know many
maybe medical plants that were growing or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever we could be growing But there's
so much science and data that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: collected over the last 50 75 years on
what our slow makeup should be Let the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical make the competition MPK your
levels We've got so much data that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: really count on to make sure that we're
starting out in right foot forward So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, why wouldn't you use those tools
just to make sure things are gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have customers doing this in a two by
four raised bed couple fabric pots Just
[SPEAKER_00]: because they really want to see that super
high quality jungle boys product without
[SPEAKER_00]: having to go through all of the effort You
know, maybe some crazy for negation or
[SPEAKER_00]: Rockwell, you know people know we can do
it with living soil already So it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: let's let's get rid of all the BS and get
down to really the meat and potatoes of
[SPEAKER_01]: the situation Because when you do a soil
test, right you're getting I think most
[SPEAKER_01]: people use Logan labs I know there's a ton
of different places you can get soil tests
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like the most popular one is
Logan labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a breakdown, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different tests that can
be done and they give you kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown Can you explain kind of that
process?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it consists of that you see on
that breakdown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and there's a lot of different soil
tests You could do you could do a very
[SPEAKER_00]: simple soil test for just a couple dollars
through a local lab The main thing is and
[SPEAKER_00]: the reason why people use Logan labs is
because they took him in the most amounts
[SPEAKER_00]: of samples in America And they have the
best rapport and main thing is even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: find somebody local, which you might want
to do Just because of the cost of things
[SPEAKER_00]: stick with that lab Do not change labs
because all their machines are different
[SPEAKER_00]: all of their calibration is different
trying to compare Two results from two
[SPEAKER_00]: different labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have a very bad time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pick a lab stick with it Many people
are using Logan labs because it's just so
[SPEAKER_00]: easy to translate in common ways but I
still personally take my soil test for
[SPEAKER_00]: that on over to the soil doctor he charges
you $45 to give you a Four page write-up
[SPEAKER_00]: on that and take all the guesswork out of
you and tell you exactly what to amend per
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral So you can't go wrong in that
situation and you should be doing That
[SPEAKER_00]: soil testing a lot in the beginning and
then taper off later down the road as
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing patterns I know a lot of
commercial facilities use it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's it's so justifiable when
you're gonna have such an increase,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned $45 for the consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's another $50 for the actual
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hundred bucks I know sometimes
they'll do it before they plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: There's companies also will spend the
money and do it before they flip the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower To make sure that they're optimized
going into the flower stage and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a commercial facility So it's very
useful there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about home growers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recommend they get soil test too
or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, definitely You know the soil testing
side of things takes a lot less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you only need two cuts of soil So
if you're growing it any more than two
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts of soil, you know, you're definitely
a candidate for it It's just can you
[SPEAKER_00]: justify spending that much money in such a
small situation, you know for me I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: reuse my soil forever My soil is something
like some of my consider Mike some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: customers consider their soil to be
something that I could pass on to the next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation The next generation of feet on
this farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then managing it moving forward is very
important to them I know in a tent that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not that big of a deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just wipe it clean and start over
But the main thing is return on your
[SPEAKER_00]: investment, you know, let's let's do this
once Let's do it right and let's prove to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else going along with viewing
need to do this That is successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what I'm doing So a small grower
small tent grower You know five or seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pots situation kind of changes too
much to do this but If you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: towards living soil or going towards just
using your soil more than once or twice
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely do it Now what about the folks
that are running synthetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying is they can
justify the cost of the test and the
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting but they're a synthetic grower
They go use synthetic or salt based
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you recommend them also getting soil
tests?
[SPEAKER_00]: We would recommend a little bit of a
different test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The test that we would recommend is called
a drip Drain test so we're gonna send in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little Sample the water that we're further
getting into the plant and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: send a little sample the water that's off
You know draining off the runoff So we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna compare those two in the laboratory
and see what's holding into the media by
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously what's collecting on the bottom
of it and we can adjust our Nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: levels with that drip drain test to know
where things are at and where we should
[SPEAKER_01]: move forward Okay, gotcha And then I
talked about the frequency like I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: of commercial facilities getting testing
before they plant the crop also flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stage What is your recommendation?
[SPEAKER_01]: For how often I've heard some people say
only once a cycle, you know once before
[SPEAKER_01]: you plant would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once before you plant would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know more than once throughout the
life cycle or what if this was me helping
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody is set up a new facility a new
grow a new situation I would start testing
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as you can afford to so,
you know, once that soil is mixed it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bed You're getting ready to plant or
obviously before you're getting ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as long as that soil is in the bed
You've done everything you're gonna do to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say that's a perfect time To pull a
sample because even if you do plant you
[SPEAKER_00]: can still make adjustments by just doing a
basic Fertigation that's got minerals or
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrients that you need to how do you
actually take a sample for those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to do the whole sampling
process Definitely with rubber gloves on
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't want any oils from our
fingers to you know affect that test or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that If you can afford to
you should go to Amazon and order a core
[SPEAKER_00]: sampling tool So there's a cool t-shaped
device that you can insert into the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: turn it pull up and then it's gonna
collect That sample so you can dump it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not touching it with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can guarantee it's gonna be as best as
possible Logan Labs requires two cups of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally will do a saturated paste
test where I'm sending them my soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight ounces of my water they're gonna
combine the two together and create a
[SPEAKER_00]: paste So they're best trying to recreate
my situation at home and then they read
[SPEAKER_00]: the available nutrients that's available
to my soil allowing me to know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend and Most most of the time I'm
amending what the plant has removed from
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha Okay, and then what's the
turnaround time to kind of get results
[SPEAKER_01]: back from them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will ship out my sample overnight and
pay a good amount of money for that You
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get your samples there by Monday
or Tuesday?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're gonna get a email by about
Friday requesting you to pay that invoice
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you get your results back Okay,
so it's not too long of a process there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like it sounds like they get
through them pretty quickly Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: they get through them pretty quickly and
then the next step would be forwarding
[SPEAKER_00]: that invoice Information over to whoever's
gonna translate out your soil tests You
[SPEAKER_00]: can invest a lot of time and effort into
trying to figure out where those levels
[SPEAKER_00]: would be I recommend at least getting with
the soil doctor once to have them explain
[SPEAKER_00]: what these levels should be and So then it
gives you something to work towards,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know in the future Absolutely,
and if anybody wants to learn more about
[SPEAKER_01]: soil testing I actually did a whole
podcast episode with the soil doctor So I
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend you guys go check that out if
you want to learn more about soil testing
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we are gonna move on to sap
testing want to talk to us about what you
[SPEAKER_00]: know about sap testing Yeah, you know sap
testing has really opened up a new level
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivation for me When you talk to
Jenny Garley at new age laboratories about
[SPEAKER_00]: sap testing She commonly tells how a lot
of her customers were referred to sap
[SPEAKER_00]: testing as getting the cheat codes on
these plants For really trying to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: best genetic Expression possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want to have the best nutrient
load possible we're asking these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's a fruit tree or whether it's
a vegetable or Anything to run a race for
[SPEAKER_00]: us and to be producing the best possible
product at the end of that race Because we
[SPEAKER_00]: want something that's going to be you
know, highly highly minerally charged to
[SPEAKER_00]: really benefit our bodies So, you know
using sap testing We compare the top
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves at the top of the plant and we
compare the bottom leaves at the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant at the bottom You're always
going to see the deficiencies You're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: see those yellow leaves first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see that discoloration.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that weird stuff Also plants that
they have an over of too much nutrients of
[SPEAKER_00]: one kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna get rid of it in those lower
leaves So we're going to collect about 90
[SPEAKER_00]: grams of samples from the lower leaf of
the plant We want leaves that are fully
[SPEAKER_00]: developed but still have obviously,
you know a nice green color in them And
[SPEAKER_00]: then with the top of the plant we're going
to collect from almost the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant But a little bit lower where we have
full green Of the leaf, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want a brand new leaf that's
still still going and pushing out We want
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's gotten out to its full
stride at least we're gonna take those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves The laboratory is going to extract
the sap out of those leaves So they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna squeeze it out extract it out and
they're gonna compare it to the bottom to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top and see Obviously the newest
growth at the top is gonna have all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in it and like we discussed a
few moments ago The bottom is gonna have
[SPEAKER_00]: all the deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're comparing the bottom Leaves to
the top leaves that it gives us a chance
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what's not making it to the top of
the plant We can do this soil test and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get this soil absolutely dialed in and
perfect But the sap test allows us to
[SPEAKER_00]: quantify what's processing through the
plant to create that end product So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: very important to do that, you know,
as soon as you have enough leaf material
[SPEAKER_00]: to send in that 90 gram sample The 90 gram
samples about full one one gallon Ziploc
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fill up a whole one down one gallon
Ziploc bag Measure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're well over 90 grams every time and
that gives them plenty of material to
[SPEAKER_00]: really go at that If you don't have enough
leaf material I think you would very find
[SPEAKER_00]: a Tissue sample testing very simple and
very easy because you can take a small
[SPEAKER_00]: sample of the plant Whether it be the
petiole or the stock and send that in and
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows them to do a different Where
they ash it they burn it and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: measure those those levels to see what's
in the plant and what's it's what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do compared to a sap test we're
squeezing out the juice and Measuring that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like a blood test that the doctor
would do giving you a real-time way of
[SPEAKER_00]: doing so So with the soil doctor,
I know he counts on the tissues testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that's the way to go He counts on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He loves that that's just been around for
a lot longer the staff testing is
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely a little bit newer to the game
and Can give you a little bit of a more
[SPEAKER_00]: real-time situation with what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I conducted sap testing I found
out if I feed any more nitrogen I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: start creating a pest problem If I don't
feed my minerals that I'm lacking in I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna end up having some TM issues So it's
very commonly known in all agriculture all
[SPEAKER_00]: plants if you have a deficiency in copper
You're most likely going to end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: mold or mildew So I saw those copper
levels were almost non-existent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They measure them in parts per million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said to myself immediately Okay,
I need to start doing some copper foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: sprays Now the only way to obtain a lot of
these minerals is to use a sulfate which
[SPEAKER_00]: is a non-organic product So that's a big
shocker for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to use something that's
non-organic in my organic garden Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to understand that as far as
everything goes in the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: everything goes in the United States if
we're taking a test a sample we're sending
[SPEAKER_00]: it into a Laboratory that laboratory is
determining that we're low on these
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're allowed to use a non-organic
substance To get those levels where it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be and it still remains organic
because we have not gone over those levels
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the second we add way too much when we
go over those levels It's not considered
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farming and you're synthetically
feeding the system or obviously and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna have problems because you've given
it too much so with that stop testing it
[SPEAKER_00]: really let me lead forward with some
corrective foliar sprays and some
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements in growth and That year I was
blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I planted July 5th first in my
greenhouse and by June Or excuse me about
[SPEAKER_00]: August 14th or 15th the time when
everything flips over to flower in
[SPEAKER_00]: California I had tremendous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had sometimes eight foot growth in some
of these plants, which is just absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: insane But you know, I'm using that sap
testing to be feeding it supplement leave
[SPEAKER_00]: like spoon feeding it Everything it needs
and I know what it needs because I
[SPEAKER_00]: collected those samples and I'm not using
bro science So it's been fun It really has
[SPEAKER_00]: been been quite a journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the cheat codes for growers for
sure So how often would you do a sap test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know just like a soil test you
want to do it, you know frequently,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know for me the first year I did it I
I pulled my samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw these little levels I did some
corrective foliar spray for a week or two
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to wait three days after foliar
spraying before I can collect my next
[SPEAKER_00]: sample So then I got to the point where a
Friday afternoon I'd come to my farm do my
[SPEAKER_00]: corrective foliar spray I'd be there
Monday morning at 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collect my samples before 8 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's really important to collect
those samples as early as possible in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning Then we're gonna you know
immediately overnight ship those out We're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna cold pack them so they don't you
know get a chance to volatilize or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything crazy happening in there to be
nice and cold Get that out there and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna give you You know a great response
of what's going on So when I first started
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this I did it a lot because I wanted
to see the changes and see what's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: This last year, I felt it a little bit
more accurate to do a test before I
[SPEAKER_00]: planted So I saw my plants and what their
health was before going into my soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system, which I knew was in, you know,
a really good situation I planted them in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them sit for a week or two and I'm
still well in veg I pulled another sample
[SPEAKER_00]: just to see how things are going in that
soil that I've put on the right path and I
[SPEAKER_00]: still saw a couple little things like iron
copper also boron Which creates the big
[SPEAKER_00]: holes if you're low on boron You're gonna
get a big hole in your stem which slows
[SPEAKER_00]: down the amount of water that can pass
through the stem So I decided I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: spray some I was excuse me I was told that
I should Correctively foliar spray some
[SPEAKER_00]: boron but also at the same time with
calcium Boron and calcium should always be
[SPEAKER_00]: applied together and it really makes the
get into the plant a lot easier I'm sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you've heard that a lot of times before so
I kind of went through this process at
[SPEAKER_00]: twice a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that boron calcium spray and do a
little iron and copper foliar spray to
[SPEAKER_00]: offset that and If you're an ever
impressed by the way your plants grow if
[SPEAKER_00]: you do this stuff It's gonna just blow
your mind Especially if you've been
[SPEAKER_00]: working the same strain for several years
and you're just so used to what it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like So used to what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just if this is the plant I know it
you put it through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna see genetic expressions
You've never seen before gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like sap testing can be
extremely beneficial in certain
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances Especially if you're at like
a commercial facility now, let me ask you
[SPEAKER_01]: this Home growers do they traditionally
get sap testing done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well with the sap testing you have to have
the right amount of leaves to send in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sample You got to have 90 grams at the top
and the bottom So, you know, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be at least, you know in a four by
eight tent pushing four plants per four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four square to have enough leaf material
to do So if you don't have enough leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: material to do so, honestly I think you're
gonna find tissue testing a better way of
[SPEAKER_00]: going because it's a smaller sample you
can Pretty much the same amount of data.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does a sap test cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: New age laboratories if you just do one
test just once I think it's $75 If you
[SPEAKER_00]: sign up to do 10 tests over whatever
period of time you want to do You can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it for a little bit of a lower price.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's somewhere around $60 Okay,
and so that one test is that that's for
[SPEAKER_01]: both the top part of the plant leaves that
you collect and also the bottom part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant Yeah, that's considered one
sample the new and the old And they're
[SPEAKER_00]: compared together and then we get a
breakdown of every different mineral Your
[SPEAKER_00]: BRICS level so we can see what the sugar
levels are we're gonna see the pH of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material we're gonna see so many
different things that Really allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: become an expert in your own situation
Especially for people who are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: side-by-side stuff or have the same setups
as other people you really want to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: step ahead employ some of this science and
you'll really be able to see and Have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know recordable data next to what
you're seeing that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah sap testing is something I've never
done before, you know, I'm just a smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: home grower I grow no more than 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I'm allowed to grow in my state
soil testing I've done before but the sap
[SPEAKER_01]: testing I haven't so I think I need to
kind of send one out and I think for me
[SPEAKER_01]: being a home grower When it would be
beneficial do is maybe while it's in veg
[SPEAKER_01]: big enough to where I could pull the
leaves off before flipping a flower I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like potentially that would be beneficial
because then I'd get that report Know
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm struggling and make adjustments
before flipping the flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I would do at a bare
minimum because you know, you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping the flower You've got several
weeks of foliar spraying that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: done there and so you get to a point where
you're like, oh my gosh These buds are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting big and I don't feel comfortable
foliar spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm risking mold and mildew and that kind
of stuff Me I foliar spray quite a while
[SPEAKER_00]: through flower because I'm supplementing
products to prevent those issues from
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in the beginning And I don't
have my cover on my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not trapping in a bunch of humidity
You know, it's getting a chance to dry out
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody's situation a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense Let's move on talk about
tissue testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of touched on upon it a little
bit Give us the details about tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I honestly would count on somebody
like the soil doctor for all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced information I personally have
never conducted a tissue test myself two
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago I got into sap testing and that
was the first thing That you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's shown to me is it's a better form
of testing because they're not burning the
[SPEAKER_00]: material You're getting you know,
the best information directly out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant right then and there So tissue
testing I think can be better for somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that's on a smaller scale and you know
Maybe you should be doing one of each just
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what test is more beneficial for
you You know, maybe it's sap testing
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way to go because you like
that process and it's easy for you Maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: the tissue testing is gonna really be A
better simpler process for you in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know me personally I'm gonna imply
some tissue testing and I'm gonna compare
[SPEAKER_00]: some things and I'm gonna see what's
easier What's what's more simpler for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really about the less labor and what
what's you know, making us have it enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: growing Let's let's enjoy growing and not
be like, oh my gosh, I have to follow your
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's ruining my life So I like to keep
things positive now I assume tissue
[SPEAKER_01]: sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you need a lot smaller
amount of plant material Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is like a tissue test done?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it cost things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I actually don't know because I
haven't I haven't been done one myself
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people take you know samples of
a stock put it in a ziploc baggie Properly
[SPEAKER_00]: label it and send it out to the laboratory
There's a lot less risk because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about keeping the sample
cold You know You can collect that sample
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day and then ship it out
once you drive past the post office later
[SPEAKER_00]: on the end of the day Compared to a sap
test You have to be very critical about
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to cold pack it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get it out there immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's gonna depend on what works for you
guys and where and logistically how far
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to ship these samples as well
Okay, and then as far as the report the
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown I think you might have touched
on is pretty much the same information as
[SPEAKER_01]: a sap test or are you gonna have
different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Results.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're gonna have all the same
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just not gonna have a comparative
from the bottom to the top So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know and now that I'm thinking about
it the real thing, you know if if I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a plant and I was seeing some
definite deficiency issues and We're like
[SPEAKER_00]: what the heck is going on with this thing
You would definitely want to do that sap
[SPEAKER_00]: test because it'll comparatively show you
you know What's in the top leaves what's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bottom leaves and what's moving
through the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that tissue sample is just gonna
tell you if we chop that stem off right
[SPEAKER_00]: there It's just gonna tell us what made it
to that point and what the plant was able
[SPEAKER_00]: to create at that point in time in Growth
and when we collected the sample So I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that tissue testing first sap
testing thing really depends on where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're at in what situation you're gonna
be best in Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the outdoor greenhouse
operation that you've been working in So
[SPEAKER_01]: you talked to me before we start recording
this you're excited about everything you
[SPEAKER_01]: got going on there So talk to us about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you get going on out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm running a couple of 48 foot
raised beds We're in Northern,
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're kind of Riding it out
as long as we can and having a great time
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we're growing our six plants
but on a very big scale that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: become you know large and you know Give us
what we need for the year But the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: testing is really progressed in a way that
is I'm showing less amendments every year
[SPEAKER_00]: So my soil is retaining nutrients and is
moving forward in a very positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I I think by Three or four years from
now, there could be a point where I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do anything to my soil I can go
out there and make sure it's saturated and
[SPEAKER_00]: plant my plants So, you know, that's gonna
be a beautiful day a really beautiful day
[SPEAKER_00]: when I just walk out to my farm and plant
those those plants and They take off and
[SPEAKER_00]: they do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's kind of the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's getting to and I see that on
the horizon, which is Takes a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: weight off your shoulders putting through
a large crop without having pest issues
[SPEAKER_00]: probably been one of the most relieving
things I could have to my life Tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: testing sap testing soil testing the whole
reason I'm doing all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to fight pests at the end
I'm really trying to set up the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: set up these plants to where they can
treat the soil like a kitchen and get
[SPEAKER_00]: everything they need whenever they want it
and they can live the healthiest best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible life they can so I'm treating
these things like my children and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking them to the doctor which is my soul
test my sap test and I'm making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna be healthy throughout the
way Taking as much care for these things
[SPEAKER_00]: as you would for your infant in a certain
sense, you know on a scientific level So
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year was some of the highest quality
crop I've ever turned out And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy with it definitely Yeah,
it would be cool to get to a point where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just adding water and you don't
even add any amendments at any more Like
[SPEAKER_01]: the goal you had said I actually just got
done talking with blue of green tank Not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure if you never heard of him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's yeah, he's got avocado tech So he's
literally just at the point where he's
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding his soil, you know feeding the the
insects the worms Avocados and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking that down and providing nutrients
for the plant now oftentimes he does do I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe he calls it a mash where he's
Mashing together some amendments and then
[SPEAKER_01]: putting that in with the avocado as well,
but the worms and insects Go crazy for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's applies one I think he said he
applies one in veg and one in flour half
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg half in flour and That's like so
much hands-off compared to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding liquid bottled nutrients For
example here you're mixing up nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: every single week, you know Sometimes
several times a week or even just growing
[SPEAKER_01]: with organic amendments to where you have
to top dress You know two or three times
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the grow so becoming more and
more hands-off a lot of people see that as
[SPEAKER_01]: the ultimate goal now What about chop and
drop you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I got I got rid of cover crops because
they can harbor bad pests We found out a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time ago that the russet mites can
feed off of the clover and feed off of
[SPEAKER_00]: those kind of things So if I ever do any
sort of a cover crop, it's gonna be maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a Dichondra maybe some grasses But that's
mainly gonna be in the offseason while my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is taking a rest and that kind of
thing So now that I've harvested my crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw down some more Dichondra seed It's
rained like crazy for the first time ever
[SPEAKER_00]: in California So it's gonna pop like nuts
come around next spring I'm gonna have a
[SPEAKER_00]: big old mess to deal with and having to
clean up my beds and get them all ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and everything like that So I don't
do the chop and drop thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my style.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of doing a one inch cover crop
I'm just give me a one inch mulch layer
[SPEAKER_00]: that mulch layer is broken up three equal
parts of straw Rice holes and wood chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take three equal parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix them together in a wheelbarrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill it with water I put a couple bricks
on top for a few hours make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything saturates real well and I add
no more than one inch of mulch on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: my soil More than that can suffocate your
soil make things hard for the worms So
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've learned you don't want
more than an inch layer And it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: working out very successful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main thing is no pest problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that's the goal I'm willing to
sacrifice a few other things but if I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't got to deal with with pests at the
end of the year What's your IPM routine in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to try to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil testing, sap testing is the main
thing because that'll let you see your
[SPEAKER_00]: your nitrate levels So when you do a sap
test, there's gonna be breaking down
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen at three different points You're
gonna have nitrogen in a nitrate form.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have nitrogen in two other
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't reference right now I should have
my sap test with me, but we found out if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have high nitrate levels in your plant
material you're very susceptible to pest
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure and as pests they don't have
eyeballs where they view these plants they
[SPEAKER_00]: have antennas and they're looking at radio
signals and they're looking at radio waves
[SPEAKER_00]: that these plants are giving out So if
they have high nitrogen nitrate levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're giving out heavy signals wanting
those bugs to come to them So for me if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have low nitrate levels and I have
beautiful green growth I know that my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are going to be very less
susceptible to pests So this last year I
[SPEAKER_00]: did not foliar spray once for Any sort of
IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not do that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I do is I applied
beneficial biology At grassroots we have
[SPEAKER_00]: the concentrated biology line,
which is beneficial liquid microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a compost tea product That has a
one-year shelf stable life When you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it you combine it with our
microbial food that activates the microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: you can foliar spray that on the leaf
surface And veg or obviously I've mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: just root drench that into my soil system
every single week So I'm mainly farming
[SPEAKER_00]: with microbes and I'm putting a protective
layer on my leaf surface early in the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants life So it's got beneficial
microbes on the leaf surface Due to
[SPEAKER_00]: science we now know that Microbes do
survive on the leaf surface after your
[SPEAKER_00]: your foliar spray has dried out so you
don't get the full life but you did get
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes left on the leaf surface and if
let's say I Have powdery mildew spore
[SPEAKER_00]: lands on the on that plant surface,
but we've got beneficial microbes there to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it and Out compete it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to have those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a microbial farmer Using science
and using science as much as I possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: can That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting that you're not doing
any IPM sprays and I talked to a large
[SPEAKER_01]: handful of outdoor greenhouse growers and
everybody spraying with something whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it be neem oil or some some sort of
essential Oil, you know peppermint of
[SPEAKER_01]: rosemary some of those things in order to
try to prevent pests That's awesome that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've gotten to that point where you're
literally just utilizing step testing soil
[SPEAKER_01]: testing You know looking at your plant for
the health making sure those are in line
[SPEAKER_00]: then you don't have to spray at all Yeah,
you know, there was a grower a very famous
[SPEAKER_00]: grower in Humboldt Kevin Geordrie If you
ever get a chance to have anybody else on
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's a legacy grower from
Humboldt I would really look out to Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Geordrie.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got some of the most amazing
Knowledge of anybody in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, you know a long time about four
years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to sit down and share share some
medicine with Kevin and He explained to me
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference in between a good grower
and a great grower is The difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: between the healthiest plant in the garden
and the unhealthiest plant in the garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and how big that gap is Do we have a very
small gap in between the healthy and
[SPEAKER_00]: unhealthy and a very healthy crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we have a large gap and we have more
unhealthy plants than we do healthy plants
[SPEAKER_00]: So my whole life I've been trying to go is
you know Let's close that gap and have
[SPEAKER_00]: those healthy plants that are there to
survive and they're ready to run that race
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're Asking them to run and be those
athletes that we want them to be because
[SPEAKER_00]: they can they're already kind of there You
know, you wouldn't pick a 320 pound man to
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the track team expecting to win a
race this season You don't do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so grabbing that plant that's
got purple stops purple stems Fading
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on it and picking that to go into
your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the biggest mistake you made
that whole time and Foliar spraying or
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a pesticide when your plants really
don't need it is affecting them on a
[SPEAKER_00]: greater level than you really understand
So I'm not gonna I'm not gonna use an IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: product unless I have a really bad issue
And if you are going to use one,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest maybe stuff oil X Which is
retailed by Arbico organics It's a mineral
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and the times that I have used it or
need to use it at the plant I just
[SPEAKER_00]: freaking love it and I'm not gonna use it
again for a week or two And if I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use it again, I'm debating getting rid of
that plant you know, you really have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: ruthless and Deciding you know,
what's gonna make it what's gonna move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and I'd rather Cut the plant down
and not deal with bugs in my greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: then to continue on and be like I'm gonna
folder spray it again I go to folder spray
[SPEAKER_00]: it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still not healthy You know if you're
folder spraying IPM products and expecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to be healthier That's not gonna
be the end result the plant You're just
[SPEAKER_00]: wiping off that those bugs and and hoping
that it doesn't continue you have not
[SPEAKER_00]: Fixed the problem from the beginning
that's creating the bugs That's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been my whole life purpose the last five
years is what stops bugs from ever coming
[SPEAKER_00]: and what can we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to get to the IPM side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a horrible situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful and you're not happy I'd
rather be on the other side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're constantly preventing it and
having a happy life So yeah, happy plants
[SPEAKER_01]: happy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great way to go about it,
you know prevent The issue from occurring
[SPEAKER_01]: at all, you know to begin let's
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about grassroots fabric pots
You say you've been working with them for
[SPEAKER_01]: about six years I believe you said talk to
us about what they do at grassroots what
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got for products and so on and so
forth We're here to educate people that
[SPEAKER_00]: normal fabric pots are not smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually suck Just why we have the
living soil fabric pots right here that
[SPEAKER_00]: have a liner in it that help you Grow
plants in a nor organic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normal Fabric pots that don't have a
liner they dry out from the top down the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom up and the sides in so there's no
Situation in the world where a plant dries
[SPEAKER_00]: out from all those different situations
Besides maybe something that grows in Sam
[SPEAKER_00]: straight Sam 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know Throughout the years we had
people that we thought were crazy telling
[SPEAKER_00]: us the fabric pots sucked We're just like
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody buys them leave me alone,
you know, go have fun now, you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years later People were telling us
I'm having problems and then we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you having problems So they started
telling us how the soil was drying out
[SPEAKER_00]: unnaturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like unnaturally explained to this me
to Explain this to me further and they
[SPEAKER_00]: said well when you plant native soil,
the Sun is gonna dry out the soil from the
[SPEAKER_00]: top down You're not gonna have it drying
out from all these different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to recreate native soil as best as
we possibly can We went into a grow The
[SPEAKER_00]: first commercial situation we ever dealt
with we did some custom pots We did some
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool stuff, especially for Scott of
Crested soil services, which is another
[SPEAKER_00]: great person to have on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a soil scientist We did some really
cool stuff with Scott he was the first one
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of implement that in fabric pots
and one of the people he was growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of Noticed like hey, there's a big
difference when I wrap these pots with
[SPEAKER_00]: saran wrap on the outside So if you ever
cruising around living Soil hashtags or
[SPEAKER_00]: cruising around on social media seeing
people playing with with living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll commonly see a fabric pot wrapped
with plastic on the outside So that is
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's trying to recreate native
soils best as possible and eliminate the
[SPEAKER_00]: dry walls from sight drying out That fast
so with that living soil liner,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're allowing the roots to grow all the
way to the edge They can grow down before
[SPEAKER_00]: they start circling They're going to
realize this normal fabric down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and start their air pruning
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So It's really cool how this is behind me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just worked out But your roots are
allowed to grow to the edge and have a
[SPEAKER_00]: better utilization of the container in all
areas One really cool aspect that we
[SPEAKER_00]: really were not expecting is these growers
started reporting back to this lower
[SPEAKER_00]: energy Costs as in their their PG&E bills
their power bills were coming lower
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this liner right here was holding
in the water from every time you water
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of it going out immediately into
the room It's being held back and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: making a lot less effort for your
dehumidification system of your fans to
[SPEAKER_00]: battle all of that system so Safe water
Immediately have fungal life growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the first things that
if you wrap your your fabric pot with
[SPEAKER_00]: saran wrap, you'll probably see a Mushroom
or two pop up within 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like oh my gosh all that biology
is there but it just was never given the
[SPEAKER_00]: right situation to really Cultivate
prolific and go crazy and be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: his thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anybody out there growing in a normal
fabric pot, I Really would urge you to
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap it and see the differences see how
much water you save and see how much
[SPEAKER_00]: happier the plant is and then on top of
that move to a living soil fabric pot or
[SPEAKER_00]: raised bed because You know, that's really
where you need to be in the future for
[SPEAKER_00]: growing your vegetables your plants your
medicine all on the same program So
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots fabric pots, we really make a
lot of custom stuff We're in Sacramento,
[SPEAKER_00]: California and we have a 12,000 square
foot manufacturing facility where we make
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff right here in Sacramento
Our fabric is from the state of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's American made If you've ever been
in the military or have any family members
[SPEAKER_00]: in the military This fabric will look very
familiar for to you because this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: same fabric that's used for the US
military and their Hesco barriers
[SPEAKER_00]: barricades any forward operating base
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the same exact manufacturer
We just have a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications as far as the thickness
goes With those barricades that can go
[SPEAKER_00]: with the thinnest material possible and it
does great So for us we went with
[SPEAKER_00]: something a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went with an 8.5 ounce material which
shows the weight per square inch American
[SPEAKER_00]: made no heavy metals very consistent
fabric Indoors I can't estimate a life on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably gonna last for pretty close
to forever Because there's no UV light to
[SPEAKER_00]: break it down Outdoors you've got the UV
light coming down from the Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's gonna break down the
materials over time There's not much you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do about that You know our products
outdoors and the harshest harshest
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are gonna have a minimum life
of about five years Probably well well
[SPEAKER_00]: over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're being concerned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have the two foot by ten foot bed
outside I got some veggies there you
[SPEAKER_01]: gifted to me several years ago man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was Had to a bit 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think is when you gifted me that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate that I like them I agree
with what you say about how like fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: pots it just trials from dryouts from all
angles and When you got microbes that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be there to break down those
Amendments for the plant, you know turn
[SPEAKER_01]: them into usable nutrients for the plant
Well, if they dry out and there's no water
[SPEAKER_01]: there they go dormant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a sleep state So they're not
able to work and break things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are more prone to see deficiency
Potentially happen because the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't getting a lack of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a believer in grassroots fabric
pots for sure I've actually also just done
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic pots over Fabric pots just for the
reason you you mentioned, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't want them drying out from
all different sides Specifically when I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in water out the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this has been a great talk kind of
wrapping things up Tell us how they can
[SPEAKER_01]: lose to just find you and what do you have
upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we've actually got some absolutely
amazing stuff coming out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our New shirts we have soil
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new version of our logo coming
out some really cool stickers save the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil So we haven't done any new marketing
in about three years We've just been
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on our products and focusing on
getting out as much fabric pots and raised
[SPEAKER_00]: beds as we can to people but now for the
last eight months the owner and myself
[SPEAKER_00]: have focused on some new marketing and
we're really going to get down to showing
[SPEAKER_00]: how much we we benefit the culture and how
much we are a part of the culture of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that we work in so we've Got some
amazing marketing some new boxes that all
[SPEAKER_00]: of our products will be delivered in a lot
more support a lot more help for You know
