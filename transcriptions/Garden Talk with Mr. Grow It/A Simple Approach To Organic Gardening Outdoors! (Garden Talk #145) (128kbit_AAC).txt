[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 145.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview C.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bunny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you might recognize her from Home
Grow the Community, a home grow show on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been gardening for two years and
grows both indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing outdoors, she takes an
organic approach, which is what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talks all about her style of organic
gardening outdoors and how she keeps it
[SPEAKER_00]: simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.

[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with your show, your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got you, Mama Kush, Mr. Gannix,
doing your thing on, is it Friday nights
[SPEAKER_00]: and Wednesday nights, or what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so every Friday and Wednesday night
at 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern, we are over on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home Grow, the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I appreciate what you guys are
doing over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we're going to get into
organic gardening outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots and lots of people have been
requesting outdoor content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of content gardening indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go by Sea Bunny Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a single mom of two sons with special
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm French Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a late bloomer, so up until seven
years ago, I had never even seen this
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful plant that we all come to know
and love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started by helping defoliate it,
started watering them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about two years ago, I decided I
wanted to do it solo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew a great passion for it,
and I just couldn't wait to learn more
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and learn quicker than I was
being shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're mostly outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at your Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you do a little bit of indoors
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see a lot of big plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to ask, do you start your seeds
indoors and veg them for a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: and then transfer to outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you planting directly outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for indoor, what I'll do is I'll start
in a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use ProMix and I will start it in the
tent till they have about their first set
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll transfer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll transfer them to the secondary
location where the outdoors go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that hardening off process,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume you're not just taking them from
the indoors and then putting them into
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors direct sunlight and just leaving
them like that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a hardening off period so they
don't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that period?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that transition?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they do go to the second location,
they are put in the garage and I do put
[SPEAKER_01]: them on the windowsill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do get a little bit used to
hardening off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once they're a little bit bigger,
I do bring them outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll put them in the shade for most of
the day and then I'll put them in the side
[SPEAKER_01]: for a couple hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them get used to the weather and the
change of lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you go from an LED to the sun,
which is a big, big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're starting off like day one,
they're doing maybe what, two hours direct
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight and then you're kind of gradually
ramping up day by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: When are they getting like full sun?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I transplant them from the solo cup
into the bigger cup, so they're a decent
[SPEAKER_01]: size when I transfer them into their
forever home, then they get a full sun all
[SPEAKER_01]: day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then full sun, are we talking 10
hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking 12 hours?
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the month, usually we'll
say from 6 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: till about 9.30 p.m.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the entire time they have sun on
them or is there some like shade?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, direct sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you in containers or are you
planting them in ground?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually use plastic containers,
plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be anywhere from 25 gallons to
10 gallons, depending how many I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I ran out of the 25 gallons,
then I'll do the 10 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'll put the clones in the 10
gallon and I'll put the seedlings in the
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what do you have, what's in your soil
mix there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: What fertilize are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for outdoors, I've actually,
this year I'm using old marsh soil from a
[SPEAKER_01]: swamp down the road from the secondary
location.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mixed with old horse and cow manure
and about I'll say 15% of perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or better drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, so that's what you're starting
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any sort of like top
dressing of amendments or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that throughout the grow at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just kind of water only for the
whole grow cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the marsh soil, it already has a
lot of life in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already have fish poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with the manure, it is high,
very rich in nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have your nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will also sometimes use a slow
release pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in flower, I'll add potassium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you usually add the potassium
nitrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the start of flowering, I know some
people will wait until like mid or late
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing it from the start of
flowering and then throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending again, what the plant is telling
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just looking for, reading the
plant, looking for deficiencies and then
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of feeding according to that.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are you using for a water
source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using like a local tap water,
well water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you filtering your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually use two different kinds of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use well water and I use collected
rainwater that we collected in a rain
[SPEAKER_01]: barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time, if I use the hose,
then it's well water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I use the rainwater,
I'll do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, have you ever done a water test on
your well water to kind of see what the
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of nutrients are in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you just kind of assuming that
everything's good and hoping that the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes kind of work things out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just assuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, it's been working over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd ask that because I know some
well waters are high in, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, yeah, some people get into
hot water because they're adding this well
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then they're seeing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've come to find out that
it's just an excess of some elements in
[SPEAKER_00]: their well water that's causing a lockout
of other elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd ask that just to see if
you had been testing or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about compost teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do those at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they have a lot of stuff already in
them from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already got that microbe life,
indigenous microorganisms from the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that you took from that area in the local.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's local.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into plant training next.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do for plant
training when growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: So considering where my second location
is, there is no neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not worried of smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not worried about the plants being
seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all I do is absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them grow wild and free and how
nature intended them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no bending, no topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: No super cropping, no filming,
no nothing, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when I looked at your Instagram,
one thing I noticed is that I believe you
[SPEAKER_00]: do have one steak in the middle there and
then there's a cup at the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: steak.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that all about?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just to know which kind it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a label basically for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blue cups are clones of one kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red cups are clones of the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bigger pots, the seedling
have actual like popsicle sticks inside
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now do you ever get, without doing the
training, I'm just curious, do you ever
[SPEAKER_00]: get plants that are so big that we were
just kind of flopping all over the place
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the end of a flowering there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to manage or,
or no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, but that's where the bamboo sticks
really come in handy tying them up to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep, uh, keep them straight because
otherwise, like you said, they will start
[SPEAKER_01]: to flop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in flowering you are going in and
adding in support stakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it like mid or late flowering or
something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just as needed or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just does needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants may not need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants may.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how big do your outdoor plants
typically get?
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically they'll get anywhere from
seven to feet, uh, seven to 10 feet tall
[SPEAKER_01]: on a good, good harvest, typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of time trimming, I assume,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not want to be in that trim jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I feel like that,
like the bowl trimmer would be super
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got the money, even one of those
larger trimmers, more commercialized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they make more commercialized ones for
home growers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they can get pretty pricey there,
but Jesus, if you're dealing with,
[SPEAKER_00]: with 10 foot plants and you've got
multiple of them, maybe we're worth the
[SPEAKER_02]: investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to get into something that's
going to potentially hurt yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your IPM routine consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are you doing in order to
prevent pests from invading your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very lucky, knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I might regret saying this,
but I did not do any IPM management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, mother nature has been good to me so
far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the ladybugs we have out there
and with all the amazing life in the marsh
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, uh, both good and bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's helped keep it pretty,
pretty steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, no major pest so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a couple caterpillars,
but you just flip them off and it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: good indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I've ran into a lot of gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great to hear about outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, uh, you know, usually hear about
some infestations happening, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of beneficials out there that is
really going to help combat those pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been doing any sort of spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said you you're flicking them
off, but I know some people really
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle with caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it, is it, you just find one here and
there, or is it like, does it get really
[SPEAKER_00]: bad sometimes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been pretty lucky where I do have the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do keep them away from other trees and
other plant life that is in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have like caterpillars
falling on it and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm assuming that's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had many, or it could just be
luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about beneficial insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any of those like kind of
flying around or that you can spot that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're aware of that you know,
or doing a good thing in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I could really think off at the
top of my head, like just the normal,
[SPEAKER_01]: like of course the ladybugs, they're,
they're our favorite, uh, our favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But besides that, I can't just think right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about cover crops and mulch layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned you're growing
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the inputs and what you're
using for a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people are going to do cover
crops as well, which could be very
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial for a wide variety of reasons
or mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you utilizing either one of those in
your containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not, but it is something that I want
to start doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I haven't yet, again, with the soil
I'm using, it already has a lot of those
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes, a lot of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of everything I need,
which is great, but I know cover crops
[SPEAKER_01]: would be good for, um, pest controls as
well for keeping certain pests away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain smells will keep certain bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is definitely something I'm
interested in my next gross, but not this
[SPEAKER_01]: one, not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll definitely be staying tuned to
your Instagram to see, uh, once you start
[SPEAKER_00]: using those things, how you use them,
because, uh, yeah, it's definitely,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see what the difference would be
between using them and not using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any advice for the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is somewhere,
a lot of folks, they just struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a really healthy veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: They veg their plants for however long,
then flip the flower or an outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just automatically transitioning the
flower as there's less light naturally.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the flowering stage, people come
across problems, potentially with
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for getting
through the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, the best advice I can give
is to just not give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, reach out to the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to ask for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be patient because that is my biggest
challenge in flowering is being patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, definitely, uh, if,
if you don't succeed, just don't give up,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, ask for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no shame in asking for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all started at the bottom and that's
how we will learn what kind of deficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: we have, what kind of, what kind of
nutrients you may need to add and so on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to go back to the harvest process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, you mentioned these seven
to 10 foot plants and it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you walk us through your process of
harvesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when do you harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking at to determine when
or not to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then walk us through your process in
detail, like cutting down on the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ideally I would like to cut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to cut down, uh, Thanksgiving,
Canadian Thanksgiving, which is in
[SPEAKER_01]: October.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do like to check my trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for something that's no clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want any clear on my trichomes,
but, um, due to our weather, which is very
[SPEAKER_01]: up and down, it's very hard to,
um, get that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we do get a lot of rain,
a lot of frost cause I am up North.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we tend to get a lot of, uh,
bud rot, which causes us to cut down very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you typically just cut off that branch
that's infected or are you like getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of the whole plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if it's not bad, we'll cut off the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, just the branch that's
infected.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we notice that it starts to
spread, I will cut the whole plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: then cut out the pieces that have been,
um, that have bud rot and just hang it and
[SPEAKER_01]: go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I do cut them, um, I will hang
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the whole plant would be hung in a
garage in the top loft on strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the garage on strings hanging upside
down, and then for drying, what does your
[SPEAKER_00]: setup look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just in that area?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also are you setting up like you
humidifiers or dehumidifiers fans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your dry setup for drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do look for 60, 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it is much cooler in October,
especially up North again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do not need to have any, um,
extra humidifiers or air conditioners or
[SPEAKER_01]: fan knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I've been pretty lucky for between
the 55, 60 is what I I've been getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ideally I aim for 60, 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: It must be nice to have that natural
humidity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say that in almost every episode
here because, uh, people need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reminded every episode, but it's 20 to
30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had winter time, it was 16%
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm always trying to crank in
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drying, it's so easy to overdry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can only imagine being a place like
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's just, it's naturally around
that 55, 60% relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is ideal for the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little bit jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will notice that like, if it does rain a
lot, the humidity, it is very humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will put it a dehumidifier,
but it's very rare, thankfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better safe to deploy that out and try to
start removing that humidity rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: come across that bud rod, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that, that mold can even happen in
the drying stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened to me, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I went through a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: My fan died within the last couple of
weeks and I noticed it after 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fan died.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I added in the fan, let the plants
continue to grow for those past two,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last two weeks harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's during drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I noticed that I actually had an
issue, there was white buzzy mold on the
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh no, what happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to think, was it by drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it actually wasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to think back and be, Oh,
I had a fan die for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure the fan died and it was only down
for 24 hours, but that's enough time for
[SPEAKER_00]: that to establish and start the botais to
start to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, even though I added in fans,
that doesn't eliminate the problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That the mold has already started and it
would slowly grow grew from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bud rod is definitely not a fun thing
to come across.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad you have to cut them down too
early and they don't, they're still good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they don't get to the full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you're done drying the plant,
so it's brought down to that kind of shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: stable percent, what are you doing for
curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you putting into jars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk us through your curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for curing, um, I do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the jars and I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the reason I do that is because again,
having so many, so much to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I only have so many bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go to the jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the rest of the jars and I do like to
see the side by side difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't notice much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing with, for myself personally
with jars is I tend to forget to burp or I
[SPEAKER_01]: forget to tend to put the jar lid back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the curing bag, I don't have to worry
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll open it once in a blue moon,
move the buds around to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and then I just leave it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those Grove bags, you don't even need
to burp at all technically, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a self burping thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, as long as the buds are dry,
once you're putting it in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: sealing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you also like heat sealing it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, uh, it is recommended to heat still,
but, but I did not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even when you're sealing it,
it's, it's burping itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to, uh, actually open up
a jar every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes things a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to move it around just to make sure
there's no, no more moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, just, just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sometimes you think it's dry and
it's not a hundred percent and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: that moisture in the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to check on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely sounds like a good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using the large Grove bags that
hold like a pound at a time or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the larger ones since you're having
such a big yield out there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have a lot of, uh, larger bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have some medium bags, but,
uh, yeah, I tend to stick, stick
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely with the larger bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long until you actually consume?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, ideally I want it to be a month or two
for curing, but that all depends on how
[SPEAKER_01]: well I did on my previous harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need to, uh, get into it earlier or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then did you mention, I'm trying to
remember if you mentioned what you usually
[SPEAKER_00]: get for yield when growing out to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally what I'm looking for and what I
normally get is anywhere between a pound
[SPEAKER_01]: per plant, a pound, a pound and a half per
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all, of course that all, that all
depends on the phenol as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any particular strains that you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: Being so new to growing, I haven't tried
many strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains yet, so I can't really,
uh, recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to grow, um, outlaw seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has been one of my favorite breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do like, like the forbidden fruits,
um, the Mary Berry there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that gassy fruity herb is
what I like to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the gassy fruity citrusy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that more than like the dessert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super sweet, but everyone has their own
preferences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're real skunky, gassy, fuely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all me for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So misconceptions, I want to ask you this
question here is a lot of misconceptions
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us a, maybe a short list of
things that people think of the case when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's when growing outdoors, but it's
actually not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing outdoors, um, again,
people think it's, it's very easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it, it, again, it's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weather has a big factor to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, always have a backup plan for bad
weather.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know it's going to rain,
have tarps ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know it's going to be windy,
get ready to tie them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, because that kind of stuff can
definitely ruin a good, uh, plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you have any advice for
beginners that are just getting started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely, um, never give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, previously is one of my big
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, learn from your mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, don't be afraid to ask for help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when you do ask for help,
you always got to keep in mind that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's environment is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So their advice might work great for them,
but it might not work great for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep looking until you find what
works great for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until you dial in, um, your craft,
but yeah, definitely never give up and be
[SPEAKER_01]: patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't cut too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be kind of difficult when you're so
excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Oh, is it ready to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then cutting too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is my biggest fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a pretty simple,
straightforward approach to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you mentioned that you've been
growing outdoors for a couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So arguably you're in the kind of new or
stages of growing outdoors, but you keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it very simple, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using the soil that is at your local marsh
from down the street or wherever using
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs, manure based inputs locally,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about lights,
lights on or off, or any controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's all done naturally outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't come across many pests
fortunate enough for that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So not using a cover crops, a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keeping it simple all around and
you're getting all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good example of a way
that you can keep it simple and get to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks will do the process and
they'll overthink things or they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: complicate things and they're getting the
same result that you're getting and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that comes with being,
um, again, a new grower is I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten to over complicate things yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying very hard not to,
I'm trying to stay authentic to if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: working, stick to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What works, works.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you don't know, you don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing things, trying it out and having fun
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
