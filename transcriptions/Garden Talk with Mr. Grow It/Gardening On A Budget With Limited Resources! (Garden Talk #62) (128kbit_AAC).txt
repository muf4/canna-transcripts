[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mending with like the natural
fertilizer, so I add a lot of the guano,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bone meal, blood meal, and I found
that just really making my own mix turned
[SPEAKER_00]: out to be the perfect solution and really
just helped to cut a lot of cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes to show that by having the
perlite and creating those little pockets,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really does help, you know,
the root system, the plant, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me one that runs cool, something
that's not too heavy, something that does
[SPEAKER_00]: not run too hot, and is full spectrum and
has the external dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the main things that I look for
when buying a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily all about like
spending loads of money to achieve a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants can't tell if you're using like a
super expensive piece of equipment over it
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're using like a 3x2 frame that
you built and made your own scrog net out
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just knows it's being trained.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grewit, and you're tuned in
[SPEAKER_01]: to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 62.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Matt from the
ICANN THC channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been gardening for 12 years,
and many of you know him from his channel
[SPEAKER_01]: and podcast here on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks about gardening
on a budget with limited resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening, all plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big thanks to our sponsor, Gorilla Grow
10.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check out their carbon filters to help get
clean, contaminant-free air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The filters remove odor, pathogens,
disease-causing spores, contaminants,
[SPEAKER_01]: dust, and bacteria from the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use a 2-inch thick layer of coconut
carbon, which is the most eco-friendly and
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable source of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a significantly higher density of
micro pores compared to other forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: activated carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: This results in it being 50% more
effective at absorbing odors and
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to the website GrowStrongIndustries.com

[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: AC Infinity is a sponsor of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coupon code MRGROWIT will get you a
discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using their Cloudline T6 and T4
inline fans for several years now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I absolutely love the automation built
into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the inline fans controller,
you can have set points for high and low
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, as well as high and low
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: This greatly helps control my indoor
garden environment, so the temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity stays in the ideal ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will leave a link to AC Infinity down in
the description section below,
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't forget to use coupon code
MRGROWIT for a discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Matt from the ICANN
THC channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm finally happy to be on here with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've been talking about it for
quite some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just happy to be able to finally jump
out and chill out with you, chat and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an absolute pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with the YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a fellow content creator busting
out grow videos and you have a podcast now
[SPEAKER_01]: and just a whole bunch of good content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad we're linking up today and
we're able to to merge our minds a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit and have a grow conversation,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you've honestly been an
inspiration for me and like a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mad respect to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole Farm the Stash podcast,
all the fam, Pigeons and Rob, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of you guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mad love, mad respect to you guys,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those listening in, Matt has been in a
situation similar to a lot of you
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to this podcast today,
really having to keep things budget
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He lived in an area where it's difficult
for him to get grow equipment,
[SPEAKER_01]: both in person and even ship to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he learned to do a lot of stuff on the
budget and found ways to take an
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative approach when needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what I want to get into
today in this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can we do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got the channel, but I actually
started gardening long before the channel
[SPEAKER_00]: was created.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first grow was like a medicinal grow
back in like 2010, 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was out in the UK in Southampton,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to the UK mad love.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually with one of the HPS bulbs
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a little closet grow,
HPS bulb, really hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of mistakes were made.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some nice magic beans and randos and
it actually turned out to be a male
[SPEAKER_00]: variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a bit in vain, but the lessons
learned were fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, I grew a lot of other
plants in my garden as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like like house plants such as snake
plants, spider plants, aloes, even the
[SPEAKER_00]: mother of thousands that propagates like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also like like thyme, basil,
mint, oregano, those sort of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I really like to just throw that
in there in my cooking and use that try to
[SPEAKER_00]: be very self-sufficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So gardening has just always been
something that I leaned to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my mom got me into it when I was
really, really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to her as well, you know,
for laying the foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to give credit where credit is due,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 100% dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think your, what would you
say your overall style of gardening is
[SPEAKER_01]: like today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you mostly indoors, outdoors,
you grow in soil, cocoa, hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use organic inputs, synthetic
inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mainly a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown outdoor and I'm growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: My preference is indoor just because you
can really control the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control what goes in there and you
can control the light, the humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's sort of like my preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into some challenges with that,
such as the pests, the nature's automatic
[SPEAKER_00]: clock, you know, from 12 to 12,
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always on that cycle for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a bit difficult in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown indoors now and like I said,
I use a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my preferred style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will sort of amend it with like natural
amendments, the bat guano, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did start off with like the bottle
nutrients, but I sort of veered away from
[SPEAKER_00]: that as I got more like knowledge behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can get into that a bit more later
on, but for now, I pretty much say that my
[SPEAKER_00]: main style of gardening is like an organic
style, which basically moves around soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It centers around the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use potting mix and natural
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big on the hydrophonic simply
because I haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tried pure peat moss mixtures,
but that turned out to be very acidic and
[SPEAKER_00]: very hard to like work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found the easiest way and like I
said, keeping it on a budget turned out to
[SPEAKER_00]: be soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it always just turned back to soil for
me and that was just the easiest way to
[SPEAKER_00]: move on a budget, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you, you know,
first question, what do you use for medium
[SPEAKER_01]: and containers in that soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you like using the native soil out of
your backyard and like rehabbing it to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, inoculate with microbes,
aerate, so on and so forth, making it into
[SPEAKER_01]: usable for medicinal plants or are you
actually, you know, is available locally
[SPEAKER_01]: to where you can buy soil, either by the
bag or by the yard or by whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I use like a lot of soil
from the backyard and just sort of like
[SPEAKER_00]: revamped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll try to, like I said, get a lot of
the bat guano because you can get that
[SPEAKER_00]: locally in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm from, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out in Tobago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in turn it out in Tobago,
you did get like a lot of grow supplies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients and that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it was imported, there was a
slight like increase in the price on those
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of stuff, especially if you want to
bring it in yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to pay customs and taxes and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that just like trying to
circumvent that using the easily available
[SPEAKER_00]: organic fertilizers are a great way to
just give the plant what it needs,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found myself getting into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that actually answers your
question, but I did find myself getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have to add in any microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people don't inoculate with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you able to purchase microbes locally
at all or was just not available for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not really available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The typical ones that I would get would be
like even just a mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you get that a lot, but that's
more like fungi and bacteria and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really was necessarily that
available back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now that I'm in Colorado, I think it
would be easier to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, when I was growing back in
the Caribbean, a lot of the fox farm soils
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, you were able to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did try to run with those a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my experience with those was sort of
hit and miss, but I did have great
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: With like the regular pro mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I go back to amending with like
the natural fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I add a lot of the guano, the bone
meal, blood meal, a lot of that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found that just really making my own
mix turned out to be the perfect solution
[SPEAKER_00]: and really just helped to cut a lot of
costs because you can get a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: natural fertilizers for pretty cheap and
you can get them at a lot of grow shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as opposed to trying to buy and
bring in the brand name stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something that I've
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to answer your question, in terms of
the inoculation of microbes, not all that
[SPEAKER_00]: much, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're probably getting a lot of the
microbes from the amendments anyways,
[SPEAKER_01]: all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: That says, you know, a lot of that comes
comes with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can definitely help with the
breakdown process and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned using soil with the
amendments, but what do you use for
[SPEAKER_01]: containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a lot of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I found that keeping it simple
often works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the fabric ones, those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, you know, pretty inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that when using the fabric
ones, it can be really difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant out of those, especially if
you've got a big plant and the roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: like really busting through that fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cause a lot of damage to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've actually shocked the plant
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm using the fabrics, I tend to try
to use them as the final pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes down to what parts I
actually use, I use a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start off with the plastic part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that those are very easy to
transplant out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're durable and they hold the water
very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if I'm using a smaller fabric
pot, I find that water runs out of it a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and that can be stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just I've actually seen one of
your videos where you talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: dumping water over top method when you're
watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a really heavy hand and just
having water everywhere in the grow room
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't always ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the plastic parts to start off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go into like the flowering stage
and I can pop them into some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fabrics and then I'll harvest from there
soon after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now I'm actually just using some
of those like super cheap, like almost
[SPEAKER_00]: like a plastic film.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like 90 cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I paid for one of them and it's
just like a sort of plastic film with a
[SPEAKER_00]: few holes and I added a few extra holes
just to give her that extra aeration and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really what I grow and I try to
keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to figure out what works best for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people, depending on
their environment where they're growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: different parts will dry out faster
depending on your environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the fabric ones will dry out a lot
faster in certain climates as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plastic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really got to find what works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what works for me was the plastic and
then transplanting into the fabric as they
[SPEAKER_00]: get older or the transplant into flowered,
that sort of stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that works best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen a lot of people in the
Caribbean where I'm from growing like in
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets, they use like very creative
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, wheelbarrows, a lot of creative
stuff because it's not always ideal for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to go out and spend money on the
plastic parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even those plastic parts can be pretty
expensive back in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of ingenious ideas have been seen
on my Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a Facebook group where I post a
lot of our stuff, the ICANN THC channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a lot of girls out there just
being so creative and mad love to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I like the plastic parts when
I start off and then go on to the fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna say there are a lot of
creative ways out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are using the five
gallon buckets that they get from like
[SPEAKER_01]: Lowe's or Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like two or three bucks or
something like that for those containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people use like peanut butter
jars and like the like large tubs of
[SPEAKER_01]: peanut butter and like turning that into
grow pots or just like large plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: containers, you know, from food and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like there are ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing is just kind of being aware of
is that you don't want light to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could potentially lead to algae
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if you see an algae growth and
that's one of the signs of overwatering,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, too much water in the medium as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But algae does grow off the light there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as one other thing I want
to mention is those air pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how much they cost,
but like I'm thinking if you're using like
[SPEAKER_01]: your native soil, which can be somewhat
compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a lot of people add like perlite or
lava rock or something like that to add in
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because these plants don't grow real well
in a compact medium, at least in medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that we're referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe having those air pots would
probably be beneficial to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is air getting to the root zone,
you know, so it's not choking up the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So forget to mention that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to add to that point,
actually, when I'm actually using native
[SPEAKER_00]: soil outdoors, I would actually add a
hefty amount of perlite because that
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite sort of like goes to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to add oxygen to the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to break up that really thick soil
because I've actually grown in like some
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing added.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was literally just like dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it got wet, it became like mud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots had a really tough time
penetrating through that mud and really
[SPEAKER_00]: establishing themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just goes to show that by having the
perlite and creating those little pockets,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really does help, you know,
the root system, the plant and the overall
[SPEAKER_00]: health, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I second that, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mentioned the amendments as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched upon them, but I'd like to get
just a little bit deeper into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the vegetation stage, what are you
using for amendments?
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, when are you top dressing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe let us know what ratios you're
using, if you know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also for flowering, same deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently I've gotten to like using the
Guy Green amendments when it comes to top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially I'll use my, I'll just go for
a very basic potting mix since I'm up here
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gone to Walmart and got like a
cheap $3 bag of potting mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to amend that myself as best
as I could with like bat guano,
[SPEAKER_00]: bone meal, blood meal, worm castings,
a few other things I'm just sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: missing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that will usually help me out for the
first few weeks of the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes I might add some kelp
in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really does help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that helps me out for the first few
weeks of the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes down to the flowering stage,
when it starts to need a lot of the P and
[SPEAKER_00]: K ratios, you know, the phosphorus and the
potassium and that sort of stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I sort of need a bit more nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant starts to show me signs that
it's really hungry and it needs some more
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at that point, then I'll start to like
top dress with the Guy Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the Guy Green takes a little
while for it to actually work into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil for it to break down for the plant to
absorb it, what I'll start to do is two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks or so before I actually flip the
flower, I will top dress because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to flip the flower within
the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll give the plant a chance to break
down everything, absorb it through the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, you know, I'm sort of ahead
of the game because it's always harder to
[SPEAKER_00]: recover from a deficiency than to deal
with that upfront, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just something that I've
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always, always harder to like recover
than to deal with it upfront.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to like just the
overall, my overall feeding stage cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, what I would say is that the
natural side of things has worked
[SPEAKER_00]: fantastic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really had any signs of
overfeeding or any signs of burning.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are issues with slight
deficiencies, sometimes I may just use
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little nutrient booster and maybe
liquid nutrients, like there's liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrients such as kelp,
like I mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fantastic thing that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mix that up and I will just,
you know, add it to my water and water it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sort of helps the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't attack the microbes or
anything, but I found that it has great
[SPEAKER_00]: results for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's your approach with soil,
the containers, nutrients throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did want to mention is that,
you know, a lot of people seem to be
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the natural farming approach and
that is a way you can save money,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, learning it, learning KNF,
JDOM, which we're not going to get into on
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode, but there have been like two
or three episodes in the past here on
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Talk with some people that have a
lot of good knowledge in JDOM and KNF in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to save money that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're actually going out into the
woods and getting your own indigenous
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms, for example, in your own,
you're creating your own fermented plant
[SPEAKER_01]: juice and your own fermented fruit juice
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like so many different things
you can do and those ways you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can use things that you probably
have laying around that you could,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to go out and spend money
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also composting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a whole nother avenue we
could talk about is people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: composting their waste and turning that
into things that they can put,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they can top dress into their medium
and have usable fertilizer through
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course the microorganisms,
the beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if you compost at all or
not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've composted like a few times,
but like in my experience, it just becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: so smelly and it can like just really get
to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, especially my small,
small crib, like the grow room is pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: close to like where my studio was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to have to like inhale that all
the time was a bit rough.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, it was a fantastic way to,
you know, inoculate the microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get the microbes going in the
soil, just to feed that plant some organic
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you said, a lot of stuff that
you're going to throw away anyway,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use that stuff to feed your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you understand the NPK values and NPK
ratios, what the plant needs and when it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs it, you can like really dial in on
your feeding schedule, what you're feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize like, okay, I don't actually
need all these fancy bottles of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need 37 bottles of nutrients to
feed my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, during the flower,
the veg stage, they like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like a lot of micronutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the calcium, magnesium,
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go on to flower, you want to give
them a lot more of the potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: the phosphorus, that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get an understanding of that and
where you can derive those natural
[SPEAKER_00]: substances from, you can feed it to your
plant through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it may take a longer time to break
down depending on how you feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why composting is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like compost teas are a great way to
get it to the plant quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've brewed a lot of compost teas and it's
like a fantastic pick me up for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it quite often, but again,
the smell is horrific sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all really depends on when you want
to do it and how you decide to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on how and when you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently have a vermicompost bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the worms in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have European nightcrawlers and red
wigglers in there and it's about seven
[SPEAKER_01]: months in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still haven't actually taken any out
and tried to top dress plants yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still kind of feel like I'm seeing some
breakdown that needs to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it was just winter time, so it slows
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the activity slows down.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breakdown slows down and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my experience, it doesn't really
get smelly unless you have that imbalance
[SPEAKER_01]: of carbon to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's like too wet in there,
it can attract mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an old population of mites,
which I went through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's like a balancing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still consider myself a beginner at this
point when it comes to vermicomposting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just knowing that, hey, maybe another
six months down the road, I'll be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: take compost from there, top dress my
plants, and I don't want to defeat any
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all waste that I've turned into
compost through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also bokashi composting,
which I'm just learning about now,
[SPEAKER_01]: which seems to be a little bit better in
various ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I won't get into that because I'm
still learning, but there's a book called
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi Composting, and that's what I'm
reading right now to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can use additional scraps that you
can't put in your traditional compost pile
[SPEAKER_01]: of vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to start a bokashi bin soon,
do some bokashi composting, and just hope
[SPEAKER_01]: for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what you said, actually,
about the humidity as well is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely...
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an awesome point, dude,
because back in Chattanooga, the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: was unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big part of causing a lot of
the imbalance that you referred to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very difficult, and I guess
that's one of the uphill challenges that I
[SPEAKER_00]: faced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get deeper into environment a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with lighting first,
and then we'll get into temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity and CO2, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lighting, how do you suggest going
about lighting when you're on a budget?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're on a budget, lighting can be a
bit tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you're growing indoors,
because a lot of growers want the best
[SPEAKER_00]: lights, and lights can be pretty
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the truth is, you don't always need
the best lights, brand name lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a few things, actually,
that you may want to look for when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying a light, like the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to probably stay away from some
of the older tech, depending on your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get a little bit hotter on the
HIDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs have turned out to be awesome lights
nowadays, so I would highly recommend the
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things that you can
zone in when you look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mainly, I would suggest that growers
look for the full spectrum lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay away from the older tech,
such as the blur pull lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those lights, they're okay, but we've kind
of gone past that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really recommend the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend one with an external dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really does help you when you just
want to increase and decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: brightness.
[SPEAKER_00]: One which can be adjusted as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the main characteristics that
you look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of light companies offer those
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the great thing is that a lot of the
light companies also offer budget-friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll have the cheapest version or
the most cost-effective version for the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those will have those spaces
covered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to get one of those,
you can always get another one later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can manipulate the lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the light bleed to your
benefit, rather than having one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the main things to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look for full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want something that runs cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's not too heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that does not run too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that is full spectrum and
has the external dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the main things that I look for
when buying a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, different lights for different
stages of plant growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a seedling, or you have a
young plant in veg, or maybe even a
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning station, you don't want to have a
huge light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say a Mars Hydro FC6500,
which is what I have downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will definitely fry your stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a smaller one will work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different light for different plant
stages of growth, depending on your setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some folks who, being on a budget,
they only can get one light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might choose that Mars light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to dip it down, like you said,
I think is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might be wasting light for a period of
time while the plants are seedlings,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think they can grow into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these prices of lights are
insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot more budget friendly
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of people out there that are
saying that the prices are going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: down over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: As there's more competition, as production
gets cheaper, prices should come down over
[SPEAKER_01]: the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the past five plus years, they have
been coming down more and more and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that initial investment can
certainly be painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some blurple lights out there
from my experience that do put out enough
[SPEAKER_01]: photons for plant growth and actually put
out equivalent to some of these top lights
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you mentioned, they're older
technology, the spectrum, they've got the
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy on the blue and the red,
so it looks purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people say that the morphology of
the plant is impacted from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also with the active cooling, versus
passive right with the active cooling,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have the fans on that using a more
wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a failure point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if your fan breaks on it,
that, you know, do the coolings screwed on
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you might want to consider a passive
cooling light, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, there's a lot to talk about when
it comes to lighting and what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it really comes down to getting
the right amount of light, because these
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants in particular,
they're heavy on the way they can take a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of light, is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some of these grow lights you see
on Amazon and stuff to like maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: small bulb, maybe the 20, 30, 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be enough really to grow
anything worthwhile, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't put out the photons needed
for good growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something to be careful of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another topic there that there has been
multiple people on that podcast that has
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one in particular, it says what to
look for in a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search that on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also a grow light buyer's guide
2021 with chilled LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great episode that that'll help
those folks that are looking to buy a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: light kind of what to look for,
because there is there's so many different
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you can freaking look at on
these grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gets overwhelming because there's
so much to learn and you don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: to focus on and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now how about environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it's difficult for humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you had mentioned offline that
it's difficult for temperature as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you control like temperature and
humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you typically aim for on those
things?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, those two things were really
difficult to manage as a Caribbean girl
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really difficult to manage those
things because it's extremely hot and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So especially if you're growing indoors in
a grow tent, you definitely need a carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: filter and an exhaust fan that helps to
manage the air circulation inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had to add some standing
oscillating fans just to help with that
[SPEAKER_00]: air air circulation and air movement in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes that just blows around hot
air, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So thankfully I had an AC unit installed
in the in the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to run that 24 seven just to
counteract the lights, the heat coming off
[SPEAKER_00]: of the lights, the heat from the
environment in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ran that 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: My bill was amazingly high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And aside from that, actually,
I had to run a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had one of those big dehumidifiers
like what Mr. Canucks grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hooked that up to a drain hose and
had that draining directly outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that actually helped me to get my
humidity down to around the 50s,
[SPEAKER_00]: the 40s, the 50s, especially during
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the sort of range that I would
look for just to avoid any bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried not to go too much lower than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't want to run into any
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that said, when you're using a
dehumidifier and an AC unit in your main
[SPEAKER_00]: grow room at the same time, you kind of
run into issues if you're trying to clone
[SPEAKER_00]: or if you're trying to run seedlings,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's sort of the other end of
the spectrum as to what seedlings like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedlings like more humidity, seedlings
like more moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did is I found myself having to
get a mini humidifier and I have to put
[SPEAKER_00]: that into a separate little seedling tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really difficult just sort of
like dialing in all of the temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humidity, and all of those sort of
environmental factors just because of
[SPEAKER_00]: where I was living.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of growers probably find
themselves in that same sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: predicament.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once you get like the right pieces of
equipment, you can really help to
[SPEAKER_00]: counteract and set that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of humidity, when I was in
flower, sorry, when I was in seedling
[SPEAKER_00]: stage or veg, I would aim for like 75
percent all the way down to maybe 65,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was in veg, then maybe 60 to 50
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And flower, I would probably try to go
down to 50 to 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a lot of my measurements of
temperatures in degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just because of where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically the environment,
the temperature outside will be about 35
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can get pretty warm indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can get pretty warm as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would aim for like around the 26
degrees, 23 degrees sort of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: That didn't always happen, but that's what
I would typically aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if current were to go or electricity
were to go, trouble, man, trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that's that's pretty that's the
difficulty of, you know, growing out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the Caribbean, trying to get everything
set up for a homegrown anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, just about every area,
it can be difficult to control temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you doing anything for that at all or
just doing the normal CO2 levels?
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal CO2 levels, I didn't supplement any
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there were so many pieces of
equipment already in my setup that just
[SPEAKER_00]: managing another one just seemed like a
daunting task.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I had like, like I said,
a humidifier, a dehumidifier, an AC unit,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light, grow tank fans, the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really just I just didn't think
that adding CO2 would have done too much
[SPEAKER_00]: more for me at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I didn't get into that too
much, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about water?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you using for water when you
were out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how was the local tap water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have to get filtered?
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you catching rainwater?
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you doing for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rainwater actually worked great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, that natural rainwater out
there worked fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used that quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those times that I couldn't get a
lot of water or couldn't get enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would typically just fill it up from my
tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pHed it in the early stages so I know
what the pH was coming out of my tap and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd just occasionally randomly test it
just to make sure that it's all at that
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it's at that level and I realize
that, okay, the pH doesn't actually move
[SPEAKER_00]: much, I can just water, use the water from
my tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to be safe, I'll actually use the
water from my tap, fill up a few gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets, and I would set that down for a
few days and let that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Were you actually adjusting the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have a pH meter?
[SPEAKER_01]: You had access to a pH meter or were you
using those drops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I used a pH meter so I actually had
one of the cheap Amazon ones and I started
[SPEAKER_00]: off with that and then I got a Blue Lab
one just to make sure that the cheap one
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't actually setting me up or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it came out with a similar reading so
I realized, okay, this is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was usually around seven or seven point
something, something around there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it was okay for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked with that and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how would you go about determining when
to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic question because that's
something that stumps a lot of beginner
[SPEAKER_00]: growers and I see you talk about that a
lot on your channel like over watering is
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge problem among beginner growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, guys, plants need water, but water
can also drown the root system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I try not to over saturate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is lacking water,
it tends to dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tends to get really soft to the touch
and you can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, for watering, I like to wait
until the plant is show signs of needing
[SPEAKER_00]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch the leaves quite often to tell if
the leaves are full of, if the plant has
[SPEAKER_00]: been recently watered, then the leaves
tend to be really thick and swollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost swollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if they're not, you can fold them
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very malleable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally feel it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get really in there with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I touch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lift up the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way that you can tell how
heavy it is, how much water is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's typically what I'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I actually go to watering,
I try the easiest method possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fill up a bucket and dump a bunch
of water over there and let that drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just let it settle down in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I don't see any runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try not to water with runoff because
I don't want any runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want any runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want any over saturation at the
bottom of the plant pot either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen instances where water can just
settle down there, even though you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: like holes and stuff in the bottom of the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants can always recover quickly
from, or easier rather, from over under
[SPEAKER_00]: watering as opposed to over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over watering can be fatal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you under water your plants,
water them and they'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you over water them, then may the God
be with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about plant training techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any of those at all
throughout the year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've actually done quite a few plant
training techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: My favorite method is LST.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to couple that with topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once the plant reaches about three or
four nodes around there, I will do the
[SPEAKER_00]: first initial topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get too technical with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just get in there, pinch it off
and watch it grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use these little LST clips, which I
mentioned earlier, for those who may not
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to see, it's simply just a little
clip, which allows you to bend the branch
[SPEAKER_00]: of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without breaking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in so doing, you can expose lower bud
sites to light and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is just a really great way to
increase flowers, increase yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: increase health and potential of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be happy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, LST is a great way to,
you know, manipulate the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking of training, LST is also a
great way that I found to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: bonsai experimenting side of things,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's probably a whole different
episode, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: LST for me and topping is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about, like, are you doing
any super cropping at all or fimming right
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do fim.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I miss when I top, yeah, I accidentally
fimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the super cropping,
I don't go out of my way to do it often
[SPEAKER_00]: unless I really have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if one of the branches are
reaching too close to the light or they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting too tall during the preflower
stretch, then yeah, I'll try to super crop
[SPEAKER_00]: it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not like my favorite approach to
doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not necessarily sure why because I've
done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done videos on it and I've had great
results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just not the hugest of fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer the LST because to me,
I can achieve the same results using LST
[SPEAKER_00]: and just like one or two tops,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to go too crazy with the topping
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Relating budget into this, I feel like
there's a lot of people out there that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that are on a budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have smaller spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I wanted to talk about
training is because that does help keep
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants confined to a small space if
that's what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm glad you were talking about LST
and some of the training techniques you do
[SPEAKER_01]: because it can be helpful for those that
are in a smaller space, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you doing anything to prevent
pests at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, when it comes to pests, man,
I've ran into some serious issues growing
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the Caribbean.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of pests out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown right into like the aphids,
the spider mites, mites in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of different stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found that prevention is a lot better
than cure and having like an IPM routine,
[SPEAKER_00]: an integrated pest management routine is
really key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically what I'll try to do is on
occasion, I will just spray down the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Firstly, I'll keep it extremely clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll spray down the grow room with like
rubbing alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep the tents clean and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: After every grow, I'll reset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aside from that, on a weekly or biweekly
basis, I will just do like a little spray
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll spray onto the leaves and that
will have like peppermint, neem oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: just some of the very organic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I did run into issues back in the
Caribbean, I don't recommend this to
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone, but I did have to use some of
those more heavy, heavy duty style
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides on the plants just to get rid
of the infestations that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not recommended, but it did work,
but you've got to be very, very careful
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely to avoid getting to that
point, I'll recommend to anyone,
[SPEAKER_00]: have an integrated pest management system,
which you use because that can save you
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of headache in the long run.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of natural stuff that you
can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, the peppermint extract,
even rosemary extract, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that and mix it up,
make your own mix and you should be good
[SPEAKER_00]: to go apply it like every two weeks or so
just to avoid any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's what I would say for my
IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of people that use
essential oils, they have diffusers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have essential oils going
throughout their house and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually use those oils as an IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would dilute it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use dish soap as a
surfactant, but water, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: dish soap, use about a teaspoon of dish
soap, and then some drops of the essential
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you mix that all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spray it on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an easy way, a cheap way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you already have it on hand,
it can be a cheap way to help prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: pests from invading your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It deters pests, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pests don't like to come close to your
plants on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something there, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking a step back and just talking
about like general advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned that there's a lot of
people out there that are on a budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're either a beginner,
just kind of getting into it, or there is
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who has intermediate or advanced
knowledge, and they already have their own
[SPEAKER_01]: set up going, budget friendly set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any general advice for those
at any level that are trying to do things
[SPEAKER_01]: on a budget with limited resources?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would definitely say keep it
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, guys, remember that plants
have been growing for millenniums without
[SPEAKER_00]: our intervention, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of things that you can
do just to mimic the natural environment
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not necessarily the most expensive
way of doing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to keep things simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are ways that you can use
natural substitutes instead of the bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use, even when it comes to like
setting up a grow tent, you can build your
[SPEAKER_00]: own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Importing grow tents to the Caribbean is
super costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually build my own out of like PVC
and roofing insulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like these are great ways to get a
budget friendly set up, get things running
[SPEAKER_00]: on a budget, and really just maximize your
plant's potential, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one suggestion that I would
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can like hack a lot of your grows,
then definitely try to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use like the cake covers as
humidity domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have one of those at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things really come in handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of things that you can
just be creative with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create your own plant labels from
like yogurt containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can create your own PVC Scrog using
PVC frames and the screws and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: like twine and wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So guys, really get creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think outside of the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not necessarily all about like
spending loads of money to achieve a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect set up, simply because plants have
been doing this for such a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: without our help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just need to guide them along the
way and you don't need, plants can't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're using like a super expensive
piece of equipment over it or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using like a three by two frame that
you've built and made your own Scrog net
[SPEAKER_00]: out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just knows it's being trained,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of it that way and just try to
think of the budget friendly ways of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: things because there are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really are guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that that's helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, lots of good tips there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure they can go to your YouTube
channel and probably learn more ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it budget friendly, right?
