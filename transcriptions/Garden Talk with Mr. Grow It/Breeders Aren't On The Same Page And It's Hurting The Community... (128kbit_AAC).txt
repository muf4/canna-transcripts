[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a juicy one for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders aren't on the same page these
days and it's hurting the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've spoken to a number of breeders
over the years and they all seem to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing that has sparked a little
bit of controversy recently was Zaza
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not trying to single him out,
but he does have a way of doing things
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a little bit different than other
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to talk about that today
and spread some awareness to the growers
[SPEAKER_00]: because unfortunately it causes confusion
in the community when some people are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it some way, some people are doing
another way, then there's another way
[SPEAKER_00]: things are being done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's arguments about which way
is the right way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure I throw it all out here in
this video and I want to get your input as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this video, I want to
hear your thoughts about what way do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think breeders should go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think one of the bigger disagreements
amongst breeders is the testing of the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics before the release.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Zaza genetics on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have an episode coming up in a
couple of weeks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat down with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually the second time I sat down
with him and fired off a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things he mentioned in
there, we talked about testing and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: asking him about what the proper way to
test genetics before releasing to the
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things he had mentioned is
that he does all in-host testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does all the testing himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to be sure that what he releases
to anybody else besides him is solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to herm on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants to get to the point where he's
comfortable and then release to the public
[SPEAKER_00]: because he doesn't want to have any bad
experiences happening, such as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: flipping, herming, showing nanners,
for example, at some point throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that statement alone caused another
breeder, Chaz Westport, to speak up and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about his perception of really the
importance of having a team of testers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chaz would say not just test yourself,
but also send out to a team of testers
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had mentioned he sends testers out to a
whole bunch of different people in
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas, some indoor growers,
some outdoor growers, and he likes to send
[SPEAKER_00]: to new growers because they often make
mistakes and they tend to stress out
[SPEAKER_00]: plants more than experienced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Chad likes to get input from all of
those people and then make the
[SPEAKER_00]: determination whether or not he's going to
release genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's what I grasped from what
he was saying in another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Pigeons420.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually released a video on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link his video down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes into both of their opinions in one
video, and I thought that was a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: juicy video as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's just one example of how
breeders just simply aren't on the same
[SPEAKER_00]: page when it comes to testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are other things people aren't
on the same page with, breeders aren't on
[SPEAKER_00]: the same page with, which is when it is
acceptable and not acceptable for plants
[SPEAKER_00]: to germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are two types of herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are herms where the plant is in
flowering and within the first roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: two, three weeks, of flowering,
there will be pollen sacs at the nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now from what I learned, this is genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not stress induced, so this is going
to be within the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently there is a way to make it more
of recessive traits, so it shows less
[SPEAKER_00]: often.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just comes down to not selecting
those and using those for future breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also hermaphrodite plants that
show intersex traits via nanners,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is said to be stress induced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll typically show within the
first several weeks of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant starts to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had nanners show as early as week
three, four, five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big, you know, a big blow to the
grower because, well, you got to kill the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some people will take and pluck
nanners off of the plant and try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to continue on for weeks and
weeks and weeks until harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they actually get a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others are just going to kill off the
plant at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having nanners show within the
beginning of flowering, those first
[SPEAKER_00]: several weeks of flowering is detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are the things that can actually
cause the plant to be so stressed out that
[SPEAKER_00]: it causes nanners?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are several different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things is heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high of heat, and the plant can be so
stressed out that it causes nanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too high of light, light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That causes nanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a blueberry by MSNL years ago,
and I had it too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this one branch that just came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was flopping off towards the side,
and it was only about 10 inches from my
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to be okay all of a
sudden a couple days later, and that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: branch was just loaded with nanners due to
light stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took that upon me because I messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I had the light too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: A grower error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I personally deemed it as.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of growers will take
responsibility if they are running plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants outside of the normal
parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So too high of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is too high of heat?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking overnight?
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 degrees Fahrenheit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we talking over 100 degrees
Fahrenheit?
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point should we test to ensure
that nanners aren't going to show before
[SPEAKER_00]: actually selecting that plant to be used
on a breeding project?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's up for debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of disagreements
with breeders amongst that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just in general, showing nanners when
there is too high of heat, there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: disagreements on if that's a grower error
or a breeder error.
[SPEAKER_00]: ZaZa Genetics, for example, he had
mentioned that's a breeder error.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be breeding that characteristic
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant should be able to take so much
light and not produce nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other breeders are going to say,
oh no, they ran it too high of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a grower's fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so unfortunately this information is
being passed down to the growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's confusion going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a grower hit me up recently
and he had mentioned the Chiloto G is
[SPEAKER_00]: showing nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I heard that, my heart dropped
and I was like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I selectively, I stress these plants,
heat stress, light stress, and select it
[SPEAKER_00]: down to that three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is it showing nanners?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody else was reporting this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll come to find out the grower
actually went beyond the harvest window
[SPEAKER_00]: and nanners were shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think that I thought a
lot of people knew about, but if plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are grown past the harvest time,
there is a high chance of nanners showing
[SPEAKER_00]: just because the plant, it wants to
reproduce, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to continue on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wants to self-pollinate, create seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I obviously have those seeds drop to
the ground and then more plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a part of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you're running plants,
a past the harvest window, it can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly show nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we blame that on the breeder or do
we blame that on the grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another thing a lot of
people argue about, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we hear about nanners should never
show by any, any circumstances,
[SPEAKER_00]: nanners should never show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, they're hearing that
they're pushing plants past the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: window, seeing nanners, and then they're
going back to the breeder and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, your plants showing nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you're within that harvest
window and you're seeing nanners,
[SPEAKER_00]: then plants should be harvested at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had so many genetics over the years
where it was ready for harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, Oh, I'll give it another
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to bulk up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, like a day or
two later, it has nanners on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, am I going to go back to the breeder
and say, Hey, your plant showed nanners
[SPEAKER_00]: and expect them to take responsibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally am going to just say,
Hey, I should have harvested a day before,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are grows out there who are
going to go to the breeder and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, your plants showing nanners,
you have bad genetics, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, this kind of stems back to the
breeder's not being on the same page with
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's trickling down to the
grower and there's confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really just a breeding topic that
there's confusion, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's confusion within lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's confusion within soil biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of disagreements that happen,
but it seems recently, there's just about
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people who have just been
confused on the breeding side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to when you should test,
how long you should test, when nanners
[SPEAKER_00]: should show, if it's the breeder's fault,
if it's the grower's fault, there's just,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of questions at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like there's not really a
clear cut answer on these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to make this video to spread
some awareness, let you guys know that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people who are just not on the
same page about different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your beliefs may be different from
theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact of the matter is science hasn't
evolved enough to really show everything
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to know about this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are continuing to learn new things
almost every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing that makes it fun for
me is it's endless amount of things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this isn't bashing any breeder at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I named Zaza and I named Chad Westport,
both those guys I respect highly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gain information from both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zaza has been on my podcast a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chad's been on my podcast a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I welcomed them on my podcast again in the
future because they really have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: great insight, but not all breeders are on
the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately it's causing confusion
for the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to hear your opinion on what
you think about these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you think testing should be done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it just be internal by one person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it be spread out to multiple people
or mafridite plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the growers error or the breeder's
error?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is run too high in Nanner's
show, temperature is what I'm referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to, or too high of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the plant is exposed to high of light
in Nanner's show, is that the grower error
[SPEAKER_00]: or the breeder error?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know your opinion down in the
comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to link Pigeon's 420 video down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on that, tune into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows both Zaza's perception and Chad
Westport's perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leave a comment on his video and let
me know that I sent you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
