[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're continuing to add diversity as we
build up these worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, anything that's
organic matter, that soil food web is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to break that down into carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carbon is basically like the currency,
if you will, of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're not monitoring the
temperatures, you can basically ruin maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple weeks to a couple months worth of
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very frustrating when you first
start out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows to poop and pee in the worm bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have probably 1,500 gallon worm bins
down in my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on freeze dried corn and it has to
be freeze dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it still has the nutrients in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-GMO, obviously organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the main secret ingredient that I
feel when you're really focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting worms to breed, other than avocado
tech, is focusing on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interviewed Brian
Waksman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian is a host of the show Living Soil
Conversations here on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: which oftentimes gets 10 to 20,000 views
per episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 12 years and
focuses on educating the gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: community from living soil systems,
vermiculture, beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, we talk about making worm
castings in vermicompost by utilizing worm
[SPEAKER_01]: bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also get a little bit into beneficial
insects, which can be in worm bins as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as living soil systems.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Brian Washman.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing well, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the invite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super excited to have you on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know a lot about vermiculture,
vermicomposting, and that's really what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to get into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually brand new to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to get a worm bin going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of having my plans, but I haven't
yet pulled the trigger yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some research that I need to do
before I go about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm hoping to learn some things from
you today that will allow me to pull that
[SPEAKER_01]: trigger and get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my audience, actually, is more
towards the beginner slash intermediate
[SPEAKER_01]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't covered that topic at all
on this channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be learning right along
with my audience today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's really all about building soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really matter what you're
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you understand the soil food
web, as long as you continue to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself on how to build soil systems,
how to make them become alive and
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving, that's really the end goal of
whatever you decide to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the main secrets I'm going
to kind of talk about today, and you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see for yourself, is that composting worms
use their hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as they touch each other,
they want to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they really ball up, like a
gumball effect that creates what's known
[SPEAKER_00]: as biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to create all that
biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that organic matter is
broken down, they're going to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: through that soil system and basically
start to build and dig those dissolved
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen channels, which is really what
you're after when you're a soil farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we get too deep into things,
can you just tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brian Walksman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically grew up in Atlanta,
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I became a man in Savannah,
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really started to learn a lot about just
plants in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to make a small living for
myself, trying to do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like whatever I want to try to
do that I feel like I can make money with,
[SPEAKER_00]: I focused on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, online poker was really
big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got really deep into that,
started to be able to provide a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: life for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved to Colorado, continued to kind of
hone those skills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then April 15th, 2011, the government
shut all that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I foolishly, I guess, thought that
I was going to do that for the rest of my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely it wasn't as it wasn't
glamorous or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the skill set to be a
glamorous poker player.
[SPEAKER_00]: But playing online and stuff allowed me to
at least work from home, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when that was taken away from me,
they also froze the funds that you had in
[SPEAKER_00]: your in your account.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a full tilt account, an ultimate
bet account, like absolute kind of same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, absolute poker account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when those were frozen, I really had
no other skill set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't graduated from college or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only really, you know, where am I
going to go from here is when I started to
[SPEAKER_00]: study soil sciences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I actually started to
learn about people like Dr. Elaine Ingham.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, I learned about a guy named
Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's wrote, you know, three books that I
feel like, you know, your audience should
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely view as like a blueprint for
understanding things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's simple to remember, Teaming with
Microbes, Teaming with Nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Teaming with Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would personally recommend, especially
if you're new to this, to just read the
[SPEAKER_00]: Teaming with Microbes book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, in my opinion, read the Teaming with
Fungi book, the third book, and then come
[SPEAKER_00]: back to his second book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that one, for me, as far as being
educated in Georgia, that book was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hard for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I felt like if you can understand
concepts and maybe see some more verbiage
[SPEAKER_00]: that you recognize, that second book is
going to be a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I was kind of forced into
understanding our new path, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: because, yeah, the government literally
shut it down on Tax Day 2011.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with kind of the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is vermiculture and what is
vermicomposting?
[SPEAKER_00]: So vermiculture is basically, you know,
you're going out of your way to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that there really are no mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of composting yourself,
what's also kind of known as hot
[SPEAKER_00]: composting, vermiculture is a simple
definition, is you're using composting
[SPEAKER_00]: worms to break down organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the easiest ways to do that is,
in my opinion, using four different
[SPEAKER_00]: composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get into that in a minute,
but that really is kind of the basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then really get into vermicasts,
which is worm castings, vermiculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that kind of stuff to me just really
means that we're using composting worms in
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with other things in the soil
food web, springtail mites, rove beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're going to get into all that
stuff, but we're using a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things in mother nature that are
beneficial are going to work in harmony
[SPEAKER_00]: with one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as we understand creating
diversity and we really focus on moving
[SPEAKER_00]: things kind of more towards as best we
can, especially in an indoor environment
[SPEAKER_00]: to the old growth forest, the easier it's
going to be for us as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much like the end goal for this
process, would be to obtain either
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicompost or worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how long does this process actually
take?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're getting into the worm
castings, that really is the black gold,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're farming, that's kind of the
stuff that can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an inoculant, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it provides nutrients, but that's not
necessarily what we're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just after viewing it as an
inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the large fields, like if you're a
major manufacturer of a worm farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: a million worms is probably doing 700
pounds of worm castings every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: To bring that down to scale for the rest
of us that are doing this in our basements
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of stuff in the backyard,
you're going to need about 2,000 of those
[SPEAKER_00]: composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say composting worms,
I'm usually referring to red weaklers with
[SPEAKER_00]: these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be optimal conditions,
but they're going to create about seven
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds every month for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, you need to kind of
start with at least 2,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, in optimal conditions, they're
going to completely double their
[SPEAKER_00]: population every 90 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that extra 1,000 that you buy,
in my opinion, is worth it, since it'll go
[SPEAKER_00]: to basically two, four, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with math, I feel like buying that
extra 1,000, if you can get maybe 4,000 to
[SPEAKER_00]: start, that's really where I guess
basically it's how quickly are you wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to, quote unquote, buy time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you've purchased composting
worms, you're never going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase those again as long as you
maintain the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to start the process, really,
I think starting with the container,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I mentioned, a lot of my growers,
a lot of the people who tuned into me are
[SPEAKER_01]: more home-grown side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming they're going to be
working in small containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're probably more of like a
larger container type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us what container size you
use for it and then also what you
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend for someone who is new to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to kind of set this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've tried a variety of
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you Google, they talk about how
cheaply you can do stuff with plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: tubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had the success that you're
going to need as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really trying to create optimal
goals with your composting worms and that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff, you're going to need a
fabric pot, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically view that as the stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the stomach of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we are building that up is
because we are trying to create what's
[SPEAKER_00]: known as the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a fancy word for where all those
roots and exudates are feeding that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to really have that be a thriving and
have it come alive and become thriving,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to have plenty of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I feel like fabric pots
are where it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, since I mentioned that it's a
stomach, I would say that the minimal,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're going to do this, in my opinion,
correctly with the amount of volume that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to get, then I would say
that a 20 gallon fabric pot should be
[SPEAKER_00]: minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy to move relatively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as things start to build up,
you can continue to inoculate other pots
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you wanted to maybe have smaller
pots, I would just say consider your 20
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon as your mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really into this or you're using
this to continue to improve your overall
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, then you're going to want to go to
what I have in my basement, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: several hundred gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason that I'm doing that is
because it takes a long time to create
[SPEAKER_00]: those castings, especially if you start
with 2000 worms in a hundred gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to probably take you a year
before that really starts to churn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's how quickly do you want
things to take hold?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have time and you don't have a
lot of money, that's where just
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding and being proactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're starting a little project
and that's three months down the road,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something that I always tell
consulting clients as well as our audience
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of thing is be so proactive
that the first thing you do before you
[SPEAKER_00]: even start to set up your tent or build
your grow out or focus on your backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: farm is to get that worm bin going so that
you have your fresh, you know what went
[SPEAKER_00]: into worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those that are new, they've got
their 20 gallon container or whatever size
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the starting material?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they put in there to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I actually, I wanted to make sure
that I had this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have this in front of me so that you
guys can have a blueprint that I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: for a beginner, this is where it's at in
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has come from a lot of research over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is in my opinion,
very basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something where you can start
out, kind of see how your system becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: alive and thriving, and then you can
continue on and try to understand more
[SPEAKER_00]: about natural farming techniques or
biodynamic farming, living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a variety of different like
tentacles that come from that main octopus
[SPEAKER_00]: of organic farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I would focus on this,
the base that I personally like to do is I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to get the lava rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I feel like,
especially when you're building these up,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is something that's going to pretty
much last forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take that lava rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is, I'm doing this cheap and
basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this stuff called pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If money isn't an issue for you that
ethically is better than Canadian's fagnum
[SPEAKER_00]: pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, that stuff is really cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get an organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it comes from Canada, as far as I
understand, all of that is organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to Lowe's, there's a bunch of
compressed bricks and that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can get for extremely cheap,
like 11, 12 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to last you probably
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will take that Canadian's fagnum pit
moss, and then you kind of lightly cover
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that lava rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That next layer I'm focusing on kind of
bringing back that old growth forest
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we in a way kind of set the tone
with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use that Alaskan humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really matter what brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just using that older Alaskan humus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will again drizzle that over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If again, money isn't an object,
I might buy two or three of those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're just kind of starting out,
one will get you by.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's time that's going to
really get everything churning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I would basically start with like a
light food layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the worms that we're going to start to
build up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I focus on coral calcium for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on freeze-dried corn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be freeze-dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it still has the nutrients in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Non-GMO, obviously organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the main secret ingredient that I
feel when you're really focusing on
[SPEAKER_00]: getting worms to breed, other than avocado
tech, is focusing on nutritional yeast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a tried and true secret that I
have found that just seems to be a cheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having to buy like the
expensive worm chow and worm food and that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, it's extremely overpriced
compared to mixing up your own nutritional
[SPEAKER_00]: yeast, freeze-dried corn, and then a
little bit of that coral calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, calcium is really what's going
to get those composting worms to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduce.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then after I've laid that, I missed
what's known as sunshine in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bioag product, full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's a tried and true secret that
I feel like to kind of get everything
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a light mist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't want to go overboard with
this kind of stuff, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting things and setting things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, just a light mist with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will cover all of that,
again, with a little bit of that sphagnum
[SPEAKER_00]: peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my first worms come in,
which are known as the Alabama jumpers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Georgia jumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the ones that are going to be
deeper into that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going, for the most part,
to be able to stay down into that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you're really trying to break
things down, they go through clay like
[SPEAKER_00]: butter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, I would say I've only been
really playing around with these for maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: a year and a half to two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are an invasive species.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for people that are concerned about
that, again, we're just doing this in our
[SPEAKER_00]: worm bins inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be releasing this stuff
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once everything starts to kind of
settle in, I would really focus to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: things cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 300 to 500 of those Alabama Georgia
jumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will add the pumice and the rice
holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I feel like that is a tried and
true secret.
[SPEAKER_00]: With perlite, if you're adding stuff like
that, or vermiculite, or God forbid,
[SPEAKER_00]: vermiculite kind of stuff, especially
perlite, that's going to start to float to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of the older farmers,
older heads have known that from
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're using perlite, to me,
it's kind of silly because that stuff's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to go up if you're focused on
building beds, building raised beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, or building these worm bins
that you know you want to hold onto for
[SPEAKER_00]: years and years on end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlite is silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's that pumice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the rice holes that are going to
break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to add what are known
as the European night crawlers or the
[SPEAKER_00]: African night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European night crawlers are a thicker
worm, bigger worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, because of that, it feels like it's
a slower worm for breeding and that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff, in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use those mainly to build larger
dissolved oxygen channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, probably about 300 to 500 of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the African night crawlers,
they're kind of like a nice little hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: between the red wigglers and the European
night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really focus on having the majority
of kind of in that middle section of
[SPEAKER_00]: African night crawlers over the Europeans
just because of the speed and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that the Africans can kind of take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's more of like a sportier
version of a composting worm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once everything is kind of
building up and layering out, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a real secret is to kind of go
more to leaves, twigs, sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put that in the oven at 200
degrees for around 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 minutes maybe to be safe, you're going
to kill anything that could potentially be
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have found that worms especially really
like to break down oak leaves and magnolia
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that I personally will
spend a little bit of money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm trying to speed things up,
it just seems to be like another one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those little secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once those magnolia leaves,
once the oak leaves are starting to get in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, I will add kind of the basic stuff
that you've always heard, newspaper,
[SPEAKER_00]: egg cartons, kind of building up the brown
manure kind of thing, tree bark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is kind of layering things
out, but it doesn't have to be an exact
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to churn all this stuff
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of silly to sit out and I
encourage you guys to make more than one
[SPEAKER_00]: of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're going to do a 20 gallon,
then make three 20 gallons and kind of see
[SPEAKER_00]: how, wow, the processes are going to be
different for each one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you continue to farm and you
want to improve your skill sets,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then one day you maybe get to a large
commercial level, that's going to really
[SPEAKER_00]: come in handy when you understand how to
improve a sluggish soil system because
[SPEAKER_00]: you've been worm farming for all these
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that starts to take hold,
again, I will kind of just finish off and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe about three to four inches of that
Canadian sphagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's just a cheap medium,
if you will, to start to build those
[SPEAKER_00]: things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course those composting worms
in time are going to break all of that
[SPEAKER_00]: down into castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the top is really the secret
sauce for just life in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the real action that's going on
with the soil food web is probably between
[SPEAKER_00]: the one inch to four inch range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the red wigglers,
those are the composting worms that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people have probably heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime you Google anything and it's
talking about composting worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's usually the variety that they're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not as voracious as long as
you maintain population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you don't want to get crazy with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something for whatever reason did
get out of control, for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: they will self-regulate, but it's pretty
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk later with Avocado Tech,
is to be able to get the worms to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain area and then just take that
avocado and put it in to inoculate another
[SPEAKER_00]: soil bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to go back on the worms,
for example, you had mentioned four
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of worms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody who's brand new, can they just
get away with just starting with red
[SPEAKER_01]: wigglers and just doing that alone or
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if they want to kind of just
experience this, and again, it's pennies
[SPEAKER_00]: on the dollar, you want to see this for
yourself, then the red wiggler is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's at because they're going to be
the hardiest worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have never had them escape
even in like a forgotten, dusty,
[SPEAKER_00]: basic plastic bin left in the corner where
some of the other ones, because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: larger composting worms, they're going to
escape that when there's not a food source
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the main things,
again, where I say focus on that fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: pot is because I've never had them escape
since I've been using fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you touched on browns a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know from my understanding, and correct
me if I'm wrong, they say that you should,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're adding in inputs, have a
balance of green and browns.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard 50% as kind of the ratio of
greens to browns.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me, is that accurate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also, can you give me some more
examples of greens and browns that people
[SPEAKER_01]: can add?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my experience, man, I've noticed that
if I am just adding greens, if I'm adding
[SPEAKER_00]: something that is just greens,
I'm going to have issues with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, anytime that I add greens,
I still add a little bit of a filler of
[SPEAKER_00]: brown where it's like newspaper or
cardboard or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found from my own experience that I
have better success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also don't feed the worm bins any kind
of like real food or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I focus on, like I said, that food chow
that I was talking about, and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on also using lion head rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using cold manure or that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using cold composting theory with
using the composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also feeding with cold
manures as well, which is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: minimize for a new farmer any kind of
issues or, you know, especially when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're composting, regular composting,
sometimes you can get that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're not monitoring the temperatures,
you can basically ruin maybe a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to a couple months worth of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first start out, that's why,
you know, anybody that's starting out just
[SPEAKER_00]: composting in general, that's why I try to
teach them how you start out with
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicomposting, because it's a lot easier
and it's not as frustrating because
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously they're not, they're not making
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, with the green manures,
we really want to focus on cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started out, I felt like
everybody was talking about clovers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we found that that attracts too many
bugs, too many issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use the Diconja, which is basically
like a cover crop of just plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of like protecting the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a shout out to Steve
Cantwell of Greenlife Productions.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really the forefront on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people, himself
included, that was talking about always
[SPEAKER_00]: using a clover, a variety of different
clovers, but the new up-to-date version is
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're going to use that Diconja
because it's not going to give us really
[SPEAKER_00]: any issues and there's other ways to add
nitrogen to the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're building our worm bins,
this is totally different than when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: building our raised beds for other
cultivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, some of the medicinal plants that
we like to cultivate, their roots are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually going to go more in a width
pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to continue to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm focusing on building worm bins,
I want to use dynamic accumulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want those deeper roots to go deep down
into that system, especially if I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: a 100-gallon or 200-gallon fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a 20-gallon pot,
I don't think that dynamic accumulators
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be worthwhile just because
it's not really a bigger, deep enough pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are at the 100, 200-gallon
ratio, that's where you get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: dandelions, the chickweeds, the nettles,
the Dicon radish, comfrey, especially the
[SPEAKER_00]: baffled walking comfrey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are things that I feel like are
going to be game changers for you when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to see that we are continuing to add
diversity as we build up these worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, anything that's
organic matter, that soil food web,
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to break that down into carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And carbon is basically like the currency,
if you will, of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more exchanges that can go on,
just the overall utopia that you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess with greens, to add with that,
again, coming back to the avocado tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something else that I feel like you
want to make sure that you're always
[SPEAKER_00]: adding organic avocados.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can, we have a grocery store
called Sprouts here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have one named Natural Grocers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go and talk to the produce
manager and say, hey, what do you guys do
[SPEAKER_00]: with your organic avocados once they've
turned brown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's actually when you want to
use those when you're using avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those guys will sell them to
you for maybe a quarter a piece,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will even give them to you
for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main stickler on that is, again,
you want to make sure that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way to always know that is the
grocery stores will put a nine before any
[SPEAKER_00]: other number, as long as it's organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you walk into a grocery store and
there's avocados on the left and avocados
[SPEAKER_00]: on the right, the one that has the nine
before any other numbers, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be your organic choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like as long as you maintain
that, you're never going to add potential
[SPEAKER_00]: issues to your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, going cheap is really
relatively inexpensive when you're buying
[SPEAKER_00]: organic avocados in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for avocado tech, I think if you're
really trying to do it in the right way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to find avocados that nobody
was going to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your family uses it and then you put it
in there, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get a little bit deeper into
avocado tech, because I know a lot of my
[SPEAKER_01]: viewers are newer, like I mentioned,
and a lot of people don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado tech, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain what that is and how you
actually do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, there's actually two versions
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to give credit where credit's
due.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like our little crew in Denver,
Colorado, we have avocado tech 1.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a gentleman named Blue of
Green Tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, he created avocado tech
2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm teaching you guys today is the
basic stuff, avocado tech 1.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I encourage you to go check him
out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has been on several podcasts where
he discusses kind of taking this to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next level and using a variety of
different things than just avocados.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the basic avocado tech is simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take pretty close to
starting to rot avocado so that it's nice
[SPEAKER_00]: and easy to manipulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kind of push that together
like a baked potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to cut an X into it like
a baked potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop open so that you see the fleshy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take that fleshy part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to then take it down and
shimmy it down into your living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't recommend doing avocado tech
until your system has become kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't necessarily have to be
thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you definitely want, you know,
when you pull back that soil to see those
[SPEAKER_00]: worms, to see those springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you see that with the naked eye,
then you can implement this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I say that is if you leave an
avocado out there and there's not enough
[SPEAKER_00]: composting worms to devour that in time,
it could potentially be a nuisance,
[SPEAKER_00]: add fungus gnats and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's a kind of like a balance
with this, a Goldilocks approach of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing when to add the avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, if they're not breaking it
down quick enough, when to remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in optimal conditions, what's going to
happen is the composting worms are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to start to crawl up into that avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're excited by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fats, they be more and more begin to
accumulate within that avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they begin to touch each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned at the beginning,
composting worms are hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're male and female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all they really have to do is touch
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's brown cow, brown chicken,
brown cow time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why that's going to the
next level is because we're able to get
[SPEAKER_00]: those to kind of consolidate in one little
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that starts to build up the biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That starts to build up, in my opinion,
the real secret sauce of what living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's getting back to mother nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once those avocados starts to break
down and build up, you're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: since they all started to reproduce,
you're going to see just a pocket of these
[SPEAKER_00]: little white.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first see them, you might think
it's like an outbreak of a non beneficial,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're extremely tiny little white
worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see them start to kind of be around
the area where that avocado once was.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have enough of a system,
it would definitely have to be probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: year or two in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will break down that avocado pit as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a newer system, that's probably
not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually will take those avocados out,
maybe smash them and then apply a top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's to get composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another version of this when we're
trying to get orbital mites, predatory
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to, again, spend pennies on
the dollar for some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, we're going to take the
same avocado, but instead of cutting it
[SPEAKER_00]: open, like a baked potato, we're going to
cut that in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have two halves of the avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to take that down again,
shimmy it down into that soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it has more air, more
exposure, the mites will actually take
[SPEAKER_00]: hold of that a lot faster than the
composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will still get composting worms
when you use the second method,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not going to be that gumball
effect that you're after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're really after building up the
composting worms, then that first baked
[SPEAKER_00]: potato style method, that's the one that
you're going to want to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's going to work for red
wigglers, European nightcrawlers,
[SPEAKER_00]: African nightcrawlers, and the Georgia
Alabama jumpers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really necessarily matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is going to build up the
springtails, the robe beetles,
[SPEAKER_00]: really everything that's involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of a little catalyst,
if you will, to spark up that life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can put these all over your soil
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're in a larger commercial
facility, I mean, you can put these all
[SPEAKER_00]: over your raised beds so that again,
if you're being proactive, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take 2000 worms and put them into
each four by four bed that you yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: have farmed over these last three months
and save the owner operators a ridiculous
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of money, especially when you're
first starting to get things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shipping the worms is extremely costly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes depending on where you are,
it costs more to ship the worms than it
[SPEAKER_00]: does the actual worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that prohibits a lot of this kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage people to, you want to go
out of your way to be local.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like peer to peer kind of stuff,
especially if you're working to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Marco is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another gentleman that I know
that's going out of his way to not only
[SPEAKER_00]: teach about natural farming techniques,
but is continuing to now breed beneficials
[SPEAKER_00]: for the community as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because unfortunately, for a lot of that
stuff, it's still extremely expensive for
[SPEAKER_00]: the larger cultivator to be able to farm
with beneficials effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get a little deeper into
beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great segue to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Springtails, rove beetles, those are some
beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you mentioned, they're not in your
living soil, but you're saying that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can be in your worm bin as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk just a little bit about
springtails, rove beetles, kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction to them and how they're
beneficial and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first meeting with springtails is I
really didn't understand what they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to water day after day,
week after week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would notice after a while,
some of the fabric pots, some of them had
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of that snow that started to
pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of the ones would pop up
and it looked kind of like Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: morning over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to Google, I started to find out
what are springtail mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I promise you the first probably two
pages when you Google that, it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to get rid of springtails,
that they are a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally freaked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I threw away genetics to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still kind of stings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not realizing that what I'd really done is
kind of overpopulated the springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, in moderation with things,
but there wasn't channels like yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't a Mr. Grower where I could
just sit here and take a few hours out of
[SPEAKER_00]: my day and really learn, dialed in things
on how to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us back then, it was just on forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes you ask a question back
then, it might take three, four days for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody to give you an answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what's really cool about
digital media and that kind of stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's taking is just information in
general has gone through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hats off to the younger guys,
the early 20 type individuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel like they're going to
really be the future and the voice of a
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil organic style movement because
they understand it from A to Z,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least they're starting to.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know when I first came across
springtails, I was like, what the heck are
[SPEAKER_01]: these?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I get rid of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then realizing that they were
beneficial from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're not going to see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the real issue is you got to kind
of already know to look for that
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, springtails are just organic
decomposers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just breaking down organic matter
in conjunction, in conjunction in a
[SPEAKER_00]: symbiotic relationship with your
composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I also like to use,
especially in worm bins, are what's known
[SPEAKER_00]: as isopods or rolly pollies.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically kind of do the same thing
as springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two little extra things that
you can have that are going to really
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain your worm populations by breaking
down organic matter so that there's enough
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for those worms to
escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, once that system becomes
alive and thriving, there's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: that much you have to do to maintain the
system other than feed it, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: watering the system and every now and then
using maybe some avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the beneficials, what you're really
trying to do there is inoculate and
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate for cheap, especially with rove
beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to use praying mantis
for the medicinal plants that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beauty of that is you can buy little
egg sacs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually come in two or four.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you hatch those out, it kind of
becomes like an alpha battle royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be maybe 150 to 200 per egg
sac.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to basically start to eat
each other, battle each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alphas will emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alphas that come out of that will
start to feed on smaller insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, they're brown, so they're
working their self finding things to
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate in that soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they start to mature, they'll turn
pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a moment there while they're pink,
they're usually kind of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll also still be in the soil,
but they'll start to get confidence to go
[SPEAKER_00]: up into the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they become an adult, that's when
you'll see them either turn brown or
[SPEAKER_00]: green, or at least the ones that I
personally have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super fancy ones like orchid
praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for money wise, that's definitely not
something you'd be using in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But your basic praying mantis,
once that turns green, they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like watchdogs, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as long as they don't get too close
to each other, if they do get too close,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can literally pick them up and then
just set them on another plant on the
[SPEAKER_00]: other side of the garden, other side of
the room, and just keep things moving
[SPEAKER_00]: along.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that I will say,
I used to help keep them alive by using
[SPEAKER_00]: ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to kind of set the tone for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ladybugs, all of the ones that you
purchase at a garden center, those have
[SPEAKER_00]: all come from wild crafted areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they also carry vectors and disease and
kind of that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not really what you think about
at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think a ladybug is going to be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that you want to use
green lacewings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of us now that are cultivating,
using beneficials, focus on living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, we personally don't even use
ladybugs anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using a praying mantis, again,
you're going to have to use probably
[SPEAKER_00]: something else to keep them alive if you
don't have major pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe like a minute pirate bug or an
assassin bug, they will still kind of eat
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to make sure that there's
something for the praying mantis to eat
[SPEAKER_00]: because they will grow to a pretty large
length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if environment is well enough,
I've had them, me personally, live up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's something that is pennies
on the dollar for a up and coming farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just kind of scratching the
surface here with the beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we would go on and on and on and
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably I'd do a whole dedicated episode
to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool that it's not only like living
soil, but also it's fine if it's in your
[SPEAKER_01]: worm bins as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that I learned today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't realize that that was okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it would just be worms breaking
it down and, you know, obviously the
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having all these other beneficials in
there, there's no harm in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity is what's going to keep your
soil system alive and healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether that's in the soil system or,
you know, the, the beneficials that are
[SPEAKER_00]: protecting the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, real quick, there's something
that was called the hypiosis miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started out, I believe
they've changed it now to what's known as
[SPEAKER_00]: the skittimus predatory mite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you add that to your soil system,
it's relatively cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you're proactive,
let's say you, you added it a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: months before you really started farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is something that is extremely
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my opinion, something that is tried
and true for making sure that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a pest and disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the good also sometimes come with
the bad, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats are one of those things that
I think are pretty common when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: like worm bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned diversity is going to help,
definitely help with the, the fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They thrive in wet mediums, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And correct me if I'm wrong, but you're
going to need to have moisture in your bin
[SPEAKER_01]: at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the fungus gnats kind of
come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that being a challenge, what are some
of the things you can do to combat them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the main issues coming from
fungus gnats is that you're probably over
[SPEAKER_00]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's issues with compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's another reason why,
you know, you go out of your way to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the four horsemen of composting worms is
so that there's always dissolved oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: channels being built.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's say that you do have a major
issue, you have fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first thing you want to kind of do
is, well, actually, when you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you will always want to have the
yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not to kill fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is literally just to start to
monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start to see fungus gnats in one
area of your operation, then you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to be handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sticky traps kind of are the canary
in the coal mine, but that's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: not a way to eradicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I had mentioned, everything is about
being proactive with the living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, there's that Goldilocks
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to keep a living soil system with
a little bit more moisture than,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the average farmer that's used
to using synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we, especially when I was first
crossing over, I was making a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously was over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was over feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I had the, you know,
Christmas morning of springtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely had fungus gnats for probably
two years when I first started doing this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because I didn't know about the,
you know, the skittimus hypiosis miles or
[SPEAKER_00]: the rove beetle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that you could use basically
mother nature to combat mother nature when
[SPEAKER_00]: things start to pop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the fungus gnats isn't
necessarily anything that's going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless it gets out of control,
it's more of a vector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a nuisance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that we just don't
have that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I encourage you guys as
warm farmers, I know it sounds great to
[SPEAKER_00]: recycle your vegetables and your fruits
and all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are new to this more than
likely, that is where your fungus gnats
[SPEAKER_00]: issues are going to come from is that
you're overfeeding your worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's overfeeding your worm bins
is probably always going to happen for a
[SPEAKER_00]: new worm farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why even take that issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why create that environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically a utopia for fungus gnats is
overfed and overwatered soil medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that you incorporate in
worm bins you touched on earlier is
[SPEAKER_01]: rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the lion head
rabbit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've raised a variety of different
rabbits and you know, the goal at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the day was trying to get them to pee
and poop in the worm bin so that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: have more of a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started off with dwarf white rabbits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have a couple of them and I could
never potty train them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we built like a little cage above the
worm bin and so they would eat and then
[SPEAKER_00]: when they would poop it would kind of fall
down into the worm bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally didn't really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to interact with the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I have children that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just never felt like the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tried to start to research and find
other rabbits that potentially could be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit smarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to my surprise, there's a rabbit
that's called a lion head rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this rabbit is extremely intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can potty train this rabbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's allowed to go up and down my house
as he pleases just like a well-trained
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes all the way up into my bedroom,
my kid's bedroom, down into the basement
[SPEAKER_00]: and he knows to poop and pee in the worm
bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have probably 1500 gallon worm bins
down in my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine that's helped train him to
potty train him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having more than one seems to have
that process extremely quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now he's able to run around as he
pleases, go around, poop as he pleases.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that I'm feeding organic food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when he's pooping into those worm
bins, those worms are like the night
[SPEAKER_00]: crawlers are coming up at night to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, they're coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding on organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're feeding on his name is Rick Ross,
the real Rick Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's feeding on his manure and then
they're coming back down and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of starting to build a real subway
system, if you will, for all of those
[SPEAKER_00]: composting worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once it seems like they understand
that there are rabbit manure droppings at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, everything just really starts to
flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this is a cold manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a smaller farmer,
this rabbit might cost you a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to live for like four or five
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assure you, if you're a smaller
farmer, you only need one of these little
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's a family pet.
[SPEAKER_00]: My children hang out with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're playing Minecraft and that
kind of thing, he'll just sit next to them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll pet him and that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if you go out of your way to
research a few things, it really is cool
[SPEAKER_00]: to see nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have an animal that's
intelligent enough to kind of make the
[SPEAKER_00]: system work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I feel like even in like an
apartment, if you lived in an apartment,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could still kind of have a closed loop
worm bin and system if you had one little
[SPEAKER_00]: bunny that you potty trained and a few
pots and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's going out of your way to
think about things and find ways to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you are a tent farmer or a
basement farmer, you're just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at your backyard and that kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are ways to minimize costs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we first started farming,
that part never mattered how much it costs
[SPEAKER_00]: to farm the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just more what was the price at the
end of the day, where the reality now is
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all about quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about medicine, regardless of
your growing tomatoes or other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want new medicinal value also in your
fruits and your vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like that's the reason why today,
just human beings in general seem
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly pissed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like this because a lot of us
are suffering, probably myself included,
[SPEAKER_00]: are suffering from a variety of different
deficiencies just like our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of went on a tangent there,
but when I first started to notice the
[SPEAKER_00]: overall health of using a living soil
system, I started to get the praying
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on the plants that I was growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using kefir, using other calcium
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I started to find out about
kombuchas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I started to use kefir.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want you guys to encourage
again, you're building that soil system,
[SPEAKER_00]: focus it as a stomach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you see how healthy that becomes,
I encourage you guys to maybe start
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking kefir in the morning or have a
kombucha over a soda and start to see your
[SPEAKER_00]: overall gut health.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get deeper into that at some point
as well, but there's something called
[SPEAKER_00]: autophagy, where basically your body is
going to be able to eat itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: break down those old floated proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you understand that process,
I assure you, your life will change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have gut issues, if you just have
brain fog, I personally had those issues
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was a young man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now understanding these things,
once you understand that it's a stomach,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in the soil system or right
here, your life can change dramatically in
[SPEAKER_00]: your farming and just your overall health
in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very interesting stuff there for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let me ask you with the rabbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a podcast platform as well,
Apple Podcasts, Spotify.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they didn't get to see that cute rabbit
that you just held up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adorable, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also what I was going to ask is,
do you have any pets along with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was wondering, how does it interact
with dogs, cats?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you said that rabbit is kind of
roaming your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I don't have any cats or dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would probably be an issue with most
dogs unless you kind of have like a golden
[SPEAKER_00]: retriever or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that kind of work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this would be more if you're
trying to figure things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put him downstairs in the basement
and he basically has his own little
[SPEAKER_00]: utopia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could set it up that way instead of
letting him roam up through the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is I let him roam through the
house because my children enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially a lion head, because they are
so intelligent, they are social creatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to interact with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to pet them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feed them a variety of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's not just hay or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: He eats organic buck choy, carrots,
cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you name it, radishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we can get that complete,
basically trying to create that complete
[SPEAKER_00]: manure so that the worms break that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, now we have a complete worm
casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's the inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just grew in worm castings,
I assure you that your plants would
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a less is more type thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little goes a long way with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you do have just 20,
30, 40 pounds of this stuff as a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: time farmer, pass yourself on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no reason, especially if
you're building up living soil systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: why you're going to have to go back to
that hydroponic store.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now going to be able to go to the
grocery store and know specific nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: that your soil system needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to flip it back to something you
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched up about it a little bit,
which is cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I didn't know you could have cover
crops in worm bins.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me wonder lighting as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the cover crops are growing,
there's going to be some sort of lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about cover crops and worm
bins and the lighting requirements and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say there's probably not a
lot of people that use worm bins with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people that I see are using,
again, those plastic tubs or a burlack
[SPEAKER_00]: sack, newspaper, that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is that you're trying to
build that rhizosphere, whether I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: building a worm bin or I'm building a soil
system in my raised beds, I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: just get everything to become alive and
thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the roots to make sure that
everything takes care of itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with what's known as exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we build up that root system,
they're going to start to communicate with
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil microbes on what is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff Lowenfels makes a great example of
this for someone that's new to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like your plants being able to say,
all right, tonight I would love to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: burger, but you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomorrow night, I'd love to have Chinese
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you understand farming, it's more of,
hey, I need a little bit more of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a little more potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a little bit more phosphorus,
calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant never has deficiencies
whatsoever when you're using a living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, man, when we say living
soil system, what we're really saying is
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to grow with Mother Nature
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of us are forced to cultivate
indoors, how do we optimize that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way that we can?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I think living soil systems are
the future for farming regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because it's using Mother Nature to
create that as well as using Mother Nature
[SPEAKER_00]: to combat pest issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: The overall health of your plant,
there is an old school saying that bricks
[SPEAKER_00]: levels for some people believe that 12% or
higher sucking incense won't recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant as food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if those percentages are
exact, but I do know that if your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: is healthy and there's almost the praying
leaves, there's almost like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, when you first walk into your room,
you are going to hardly have any pest
[SPEAKER_00]: issues whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting, yeah, good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so starting from the beginning,
we talked about containers, we talked
[SPEAKER_01]: about the size, what to add in there to
begin, worms, beneficials, we went through
[SPEAKER_01]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, say somebody has all that stuff set
up, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's day-to-day tasks that they do,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wake up in the morning,
you walk into your worm bin, what's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance-types task that you do on a
day-to-day basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is extremely low maintenance,
so again, my focus would be to build up
[SPEAKER_00]: that cover crop, and once you have a cover
crop, that's going to kind of protect that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil system, but as well kind of manage
and regulate things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why you never see, unless man
has intervened, there's no barriers soil
[SPEAKER_00]: in nature, and the reason for that is
anytime you start to see weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just trying, Mother Nature is just
trying to go through that progression,
[SPEAKER_00]: that cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, on the left-hand side,
usually when you look at charts,
[SPEAKER_00]: it talks about like very basic things,
very beginning bacteria that's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: form, and then as you go through the
progression and you get to more of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: growth forest, that's where you'll see
higher bacteria to fungal ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I feel like if you're really trying
to grow medicine, you need to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: balance of that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have the bacteria,
and you do need to have the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we're going to add those
inputs, but also grow the cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: because it kind of just protects
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can chop and drop if things get out of
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you can use a lionhead rabbit
that will come and munch all of that cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop that's starting to come over your
bins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assure you one rabbit will mow down
almost anything that you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate on a cover crop bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm constantly reapplying seed because
Mr. Ross over there is mowing it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he's providing such a valuable
fertilizer, cold manure, cold fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's worth it to me to spend maybe
five, 10 bucks in seed every few months to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that that process is as closed
looped as it could be for where we are in
[SPEAKER_00]: a home environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have gone over quite a bit in
this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is jam-packed full of good
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you, and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you know on Instagram,
I've gone out of my way like you have Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow It, and I try to educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's one of the main things
that we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had live events in Denver, Colorado
before anybody would ever really give
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil guys the time of day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where it's progressed, is now we're on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my handle there is 303 Organic
Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to learn more about kind
of what we're talking about, we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: show every Thursday.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Living Soil Conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the Future Cannabis Project that's
run by Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we have an event,
July 10th in Tulsa, Oklahoma, with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the brightest minds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like maybe a personal friend of
ours, a mutual personal friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: keynote speaker that we have, Chris,
is Brandon Rust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also have Marco is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to also have another podcast
with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our launch party is also on July 10th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of things coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of behind the scenes kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I honestly, man, I really appreciate
you having me on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started talking about
podcasts, people would always mention you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're obviously doing something right,
bro, because a lot of people know about
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I highly recommend you guys
check out his show, Living Soil
[SPEAKER_01]: Conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long form content, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sitting down with experts for hours
on end, talking with them, getting real
[SPEAKER_01]: deep on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: More of the intermediate slash advanced
type discussions, pushing everybody to the
[SPEAKER_01]: next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hats off to you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are doing a fantastic job over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I tune into all the time,
pretty often to get information as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I highly recommend you guys go over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subscribe, check out his show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said every Thursday you're on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every Thursday at 11 Mountain Time,
10 Pacific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will not take up any more of your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again, once again, Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot.
See you next time.
Bye.
Bye.
