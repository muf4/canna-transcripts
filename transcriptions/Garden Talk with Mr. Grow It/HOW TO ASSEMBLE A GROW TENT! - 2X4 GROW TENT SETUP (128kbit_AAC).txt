[SPEAKER_00]: What is up everybody if you that don't
know me my name is mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it and today I've got a topic video
for you in this video I'm gonna assemble a
[SPEAKER_00]: two foot by four foot grow tent every grow
tent should have instructions that come
[SPEAKER_00]: along with it So make sure you're
following the instructions But for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part these two foot by four foot grow
tents should be assembled Just about the
[SPEAKER_00]: same as you can see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the pieces of the grow tent laid
out There are six different poles included
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there are also end pieces as well
as the main cover of the grow tent Let me
[SPEAKER_00]: pause it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my camera actually cut out As I was
filming this so we're beginning here with
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit already assembled Anyways,
as you can see I assemble the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces first, then I assembled some of the
poles It's actually not connected all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way at the top just yet And then I
basically slid the cover underneath so the
[SPEAKER_00]: cover the grow tent is actually on the
bottom part there So from here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll connect the top pieces, you know So
you got a piece on each of the corners and
[SPEAKER_00]: then after you attach all of those pieces
onto the corners you start to Pull up the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent around the top there You need to
make sure the cover is actually unzipped
[SPEAKER_00]: entirely or else you won't be able to pull
over the grow tent So as you can see here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pulling over the grow tent and it kind
of it's pretty snug So it takes a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit in order to get it over there But
being able to put it on the bottom first
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of bring it over the top It
just makes it much easier than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: assembling the entire frame And then
trying to snug it over so I pulled over
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the cover and Zipped it up
entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what it looks like when it is
closed All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've unzipped it and you can kind of
see the inside there There's multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: ports all along the top and the bottom of
different sizes depending on which grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent you get And then at the very top
here, I'm putting the top bars in to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: the light So this particular grow tent the
2 foot by 4 foot comes with two bars They
[SPEAKER_00]: basically sit across from each other and
then there's a shot of what the grow tent
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like when it's complete That's
pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to do a real quick Video
showing you how to assemble this grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, this is my second YouTube
channel If you haven't noticed it this
[SPEAKER_00]: channel is gonna be for Lesser effort type
of videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can say I spent a lot of time
and effort on my main channel That channel
[SPEAKER_00]: has close to 30,000 subscribers at this
point So it's going like crazy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really feel like you know the amount
of time I spend to create videos It kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of holds me back from getting information
out to you guys So I want to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: second channel so I can really pump out
more content And also it serves as a
[SPEAKER_00]: backup channel just in case something
happens to my main channel So if you
