[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_02]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, a.k.a.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned into the
Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is episode number 134.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, I'll interview Mama Kush
420.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has been gardening for six years and
has begun to training plants in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve a higher quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to talk about
in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: She talks about the pros and cons of
training plants, details on how she does
[SPEAKER_02]: several different plant training methods
and give some good overall advice for
[SPEAKER_02]: beginners.
[SPEAKER_02]: These podcast episodes are cut up into
short clips and posted on the Garden Talk

[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, fabulous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited to have you on today to talk
all about plant training and a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people do plant training.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are several different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Several different styles of plant training
and we're going to get into the different
[SPEAKER_02]: styles in this episode and find out how
you go about plant training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really excited for this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_02]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Mama Kush 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mama Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am part of the home grow community crew
over on YouTube and Instagram and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: been growing plants for about six years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a green thumb at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I do, I have diligently
learned from the YouTube gurus,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as Chris here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that I never thought
I would be able to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with hard work and dedication,
I've learned how to grow and I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: how much joy that these plants can give to
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what would you say your growth style
is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you indoors, outdoors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in soil, cocoa, hydro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you synthetic, organic?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm doing a little bit of everything
right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fun right now in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am mainly indoors, but I am from
Canada and we are allowed four
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my outdoor girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have my medical garden indoors and
then my freedom four, as we like to call
[SPEAKER_01]: it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've just recently put them out in the
in the May long weekend is when it's safe
[SPEAKER_01]: for us to put them outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am mainly an organic grower,
but currently I am using an ebb and flow
[SPEAKER_01]: system that I am loving it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so I'm dipping my toes into that
little bit of a I think I call it like a
[SPEAKER_01]: like baby hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a hydro, but not really hydro
because it's just, you know, it just soaks
[SPEAKER_01]: and drains, soaks and drains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like to me, it's not like I'm a
chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and that's first time running
synthetic nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's been a big learning curve
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, a little bit of both,
but mainly indoor and organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, that is a real
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had asked her before we hit the record
button.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it is beautiful, beautiful
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so, so jealous of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my outdoor girls are going to be
watered with lake water all summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to go down the stairs to
the beach and grabs a scoop of lake water
[SPEAKER_01]: and get all the good microbes from from
the natural lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what my outdoor girls are being
fed this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those listening in on podcast
platforms, you can't see this.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's right on a lake and there's a bunch
of greenery there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you're from Canada and it's
just, I'm just jealous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, it is definitely our little piece of
heaven here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into plant training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured we'd start with kind of the
basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are the benefits of
training plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel the benefits are one, it's so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the main benefit right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so fun to play with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it adds structure to each of the
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So later on, they can hold up their own
weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more girth, girthier the branch,
the easier it will be later on in flower
[SPEAKER_01]: to hold up its own weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like putting trellis nets and that
sort of stuff over my colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too fussy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, it makes me mad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get frustrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to train them early and get them
nice and strong so they can hold up their
[SPEAKER_01]: weight later on.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there are definitely some really
good benefits to training plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one of the things that I
particularly like is that it helps with
[SPEAKER_02]: the distribution of light in a sense,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you are in a grow tent,
for example, and you're just letting the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants grow naturally, Christmas tree
style, you typically have that one cola
[SPEAKER_02]: just kind of comes up and dominates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, those lower branches aren't going to
receive as much light, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I know it's genetic dependent and
stuff like that, but you could see kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: lower quality on the lower buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, a lot of genetics these
days, it's, it ends up being just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're training and you're training
the plants, you're manipulating the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, so they are even canopy across the
entire grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then you've got that light shining
down and there have actually been some
[SPEAKER_02]: studies where you can get a higher yield
from training versus non-training.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, I think that's another reason
why a lot of people do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are always downsides to things
as well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the downsides to plant training?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, breaking a branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing worse than just being a
little too rough with that and breaking a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm such a good Canadian,
I was sorry, my little girls, I always
[SPEAKER_01]: feel so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I run out and get my painter's tape
and I try to save them as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, but if you can't save it,
you've always got yourself a nice clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not running an auto flower,
if you're running, if you're running a
[SPEAKER_01]: proper girl that you could just clone her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's really no downsides other
than you might get an extra clone out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say one downside, I've got one in
mind, which is that it's just,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little bit more work, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You getting in there, spending the time to
do whatever type of training you decide to
[SPEAKER_02]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to go over the different
training types here in this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anything from just tying the branches
down to high stress train techniques,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you're topping the plan,
actually removing some things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a little bit of time right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not to say that the reward isn't
going to be better because it certainly
[SPEAKER_02]: can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's the only thing I can
really think of as far as like a downside
[SPEAKER_02]: to plant training.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't consider that being a
downside because that's time I get to
[SPEAKER_01]: spend with my girls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the fun part, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's just, you know, I get to tune
out the world and I'm just, I'm just in
[SPEAKER_01]: tune with my girls in the tent and taking
care of business in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably why that didn't come to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I don't think of that as a
downside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's one of the perks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people who are,
you know, they monitor the amount of time
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in there and they try to reduce
the time that they're in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have real automated
systems now to where they don't only have
[SPEAKER_02]: to check in their plants once a day,
if that, and they're in there for a very
[SPEAKER_02]: short period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there are some people who really
just try to limit the time in their garden
[SPEAKER_02]: so they can do other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or there are people that really love the
garden and they want to spend more time in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really depends on how you are as a
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and training's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have the time to get in
there, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you do, it's wonderful and so
rewarding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a completely optional to do all this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can let the plant grow naturally,
Christmas tree style, whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: and get to a harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's, uh, back when I first
started growing, I didn't want to do any
[SPEAKER_02]: training.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was afraid to top the plant because I
just like, Oh no, I want this to be
[SPEAKER_02]: successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to destroy the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I let, I've had several grows
where I just let the plants grow
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally, but you know, as you get more
comfortable growing and more confident,
[SPEAKER_02]: you, uh, tend to manipulate the plant a
little bit more and more and see what they
[SPEAKER_02]: can take.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can be really rough with them for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it just one good training session.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you don't have a lot of time,
if you're just about to flip, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the week before a flip, just give it
one good training session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's wonderful as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be in there every day,
uh, moving this leaf and moving that leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go in and just give her one good
training session and it's, you'll still
[SPEAKER_01]: see benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Completely agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely go about it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely be very efficient when
it comes to training as well by kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: planning and stuff and, and knowing
exactly what you're going to do and stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so when do you start training plants
and when do you stop training plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to start actually quite,
quite young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, as soon as I see that they're the true
leaves have come in and they've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: little, little bit of, um, meat on their
bones, let's say, you know, they're not,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not the baby baby seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've, you can tell that they're,
they're starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I like to just bend, bend them over
just slightly, just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: just enough to give them a little,
a little crooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they bounce back from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next day I'll come in and
I'll bend them the other way, the other
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll bounce back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I start seeing a couple of
nodes starting to show up, then I'll get a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more dramatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, I mean, start when they're
seedlings, I'll just go in the front and
[SPEAKER_01]: take my tip of my finger and just give
them a little, a little flick sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: just to kind of wake them up and stimulate
them and let them know, Hey, come on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to get going here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got, uh, we got some growing to do a
train early, train often.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a motto that a lot of people go by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally, I think I usually wait till
like the third node.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm doing something, you know,
I'm either doing a bend or I am doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: topping, but yeah, as far as the bending,
I mean, just manipulating it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really low stress training.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any other type of like low stress
training you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you tying, like when the plates gets
bigger, are you tying branches down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: side of the grow pod or anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how do you go about like low stress
training throughout the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: So once, once the girls have, have,
uh, say reached about the third node,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I start getting a little bit
more aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will start bending them over a little
bit more dramatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I see that they're bouncing
back, uh, fairly quickly, I'll actually
[SPEAKER_01]: start introducing bud clips into the mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as the, uh, the stock is,
um, sturdy enough that I can bend the top
[SPEAKER_01]: over and it can take the weight of the bud
clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they, uh, they get it right from,
right from the get-go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I'll bend them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll now be at, um, at a certain
angle and the top will raise up then as
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow out, I will add an additional bud
clip until they reach the edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, this is something I've added into
my garden over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll never turn back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to, I used to, uh, use paper clips
and garden ties and, and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has made it so simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: These clips and the weight of the clips
actually helps stimulate the growth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant as well, because there's
something heavy when they're, when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: small, of course, when they're small.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but as they, as they get stronger and
they get more vigorous, uh, you can add
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so much fun to add all these
clips in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you, when they've grown into
them and you almost make like a staircase
[SPEAKER_01]: with your branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you start from the center and you
make these staircases all the way out to
[SPEAKER_01]: the edge of your pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you remove the clips,
it is the most amazing site to see those
[SPEAKER_01]: legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they're all cleaned up, they have
those that I call it like the staircase to
[SPEAKER_01]: heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I actually haven't used any of
those particular style of clips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of people using them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always wondered how well they
actually helped train the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many are you actually using per run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it, it, it really depends on,
on the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but at least probably about five or
six at the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause what I like to do is spread it
out from the center and spread it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these, uh, these clips are in such a
wonderful angle that they don't stress the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, um, over hyper extend it,
I guess the word would be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so they are like ergonomically
correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you can, you can add as many,
or as little as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just want to bend the top over and
not have to go in and fuss and must with
[SPEAKER_01]: the, with the rest of the plant,
you can just do the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like to add lots and just get those
girls as spread out as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually they stay there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only need to have those clips on for,
for a week or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant has been trained to go
in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can move them around and you can
play with the different branches and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and really maximize your canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask if you leave the clips
on, does the stock end up, does the branch
[SPEAKER_02]: end up like growing into the clips and
kind of gets stuck or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually that's the beauty of these
clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we forget, you know, we, you forget
these things inside the inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are actually meant to break before
they hurt your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you put it on the stock and you put
it down at the bottom and you completely
[SPEAKER_01]: forget, they will actually, it's a safety
measure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanism, they will break before they
hurt your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now your plant is, is very, um,
adapt to growing around things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and sometimes you'll, you'll see that
the, the, the stock is like growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: melding into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's now become part of the plant,
but it will never hurt your plant because
[SPEAKER_01]: they will break.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will snap in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've never had that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get, I want to get this thing so
big that I want them snap and I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: test this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had it happen yet, but they are,
they are very safe and that is a wonderful
[SPEAKER_01]: safety mechanism in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, they are, uh, very well thought
out, very well thought out product.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those just listening, she was holding
up the bud clips by bud trainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm familiar with that brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually, I'm thinking about picking
them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at it on Amazon right now,
20 bucks for a 20 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not too bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you get, you reuse them over and
over again, as long as they don't break,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you mentioned, but, uh, you reuse
them over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per gross.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I might pick some up and try it
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually throw them in the
dishwasher as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, um, from when my, my children were
small, I have a small basket that we used
[SPEAKER_01]: to use for their bottles and I just put
them all in the basket and run it through
[SPEAKER_01]: my dishwasher and then they're clean and
sanitized and ready to go for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't ever throw, don't overthrow,
ever throw those little baskets away
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easy to clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever heard of the no technique
plant training?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this is just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard about this and I've talked about
it on our podcast before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually had, uh, I think it was pigeons
for 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had on a podcast and we talked about
plant training cause he's, he's big into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I don't think he knew what it was
either, but if you search on Google,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll find no technique plant training,
which is basically all it is is just one
[SPEAKER_02]: bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're letting the plant grow to a
certain point, bending it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: 90 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not doing any other training beyond
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thought is that the other branches
that come up, you're going to have a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of branches kind of coming up and
that they should be even.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but it's an easy way to do training.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're kind of looking to ease your way
into it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to do a whole bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want to try one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: No technique plant training.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to try that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured I'd mention it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, see that's the bud clips would be
perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put one clip in and you're done.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even need the 20 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need one.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about leaf tucking?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another sort of training that
people do throughout the grow really is
[SPEAKER_02]: tucking leaves down and that allows light
to get kind of get down into the canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do any leaf tucking at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, at what point on the grow do you
usually do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to do leaf tucking actually during
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, when I prep the girls to go into
flower, they get a good defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clean everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then as those leaves come back within
the next three weeks during that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that burst of growth, uh, I will tuck
leaves because those are the solar panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to, you don't want to strip
all of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will tuck them to, to, um,
make sure that the flower sites are
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's typically what I'm doing it as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I have found value in doing it in
veg sometimes, like after I topped a plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've got those two branches kind of
growing up those two top branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually used leaves to kind of that
are underneath the branches directly bring
[SPEAKER_02]: them up over the branch and kind of tuck
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole branch is kind of being
tucked down with that petiole from the
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf below it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know if everybody caught that visual
for everybody who's able to visually
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what I was talking about there,
but that's, I think the easiest way to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, kind of explain it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been helpful, particularly trying
to get some of the lower branches to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after our toppings done keeping those
top branches manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And allowing the lowers to catch up other
than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowering as well as we're just in
flowering, just kind of tucking leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: down underneath bud sites and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to get light down into the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we mentioned topping a couple of times
and really that's just cutting off the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant or the top of a branch of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it several different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually started either the third,
fourth or fifth note.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do my first topping and then it helps
the lower branches kind of grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a second top as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The branches that come out from the first
topping, top those again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it helps them more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you could continue to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've topped cheese to where I had 32
different colas kind of coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, that was a little bit
of an overkill.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I'll ever do that much
growing indoors in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to stick at eight or 16 tops is my
personal preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do topping at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: If so, when do you usually do topping?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have topped in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've leaned more into the low stress
training now as opposed to topping,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm not opposed to it at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I will be low stress training
and then oops, there goes the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess we've topped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't focus on the topping as much
as the low stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found that the results were almost
better without the high stress early on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it says, you know, it's so debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people are like, oh, well,
if you're topping, you're doing the high
[SPEAKER_02]: stress and you're slowing the growth of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of debatable to how much it's
actually slowing down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you could totally get away with
just doing the low stress training without
[SPEAKER_02]: doing any topping throughout the whole
grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people do it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, at that point, you're not really
slowing down the plant growth at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take it since you haven't really
played around with topping much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feming is another thing you probably don't
have much experience with or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was learning, I tried everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's what you do when
you're learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try a little bit of everything to see
what's your style and how you would like
[SPEAKER_01]: to have your garden row run.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have tried femming before and I
don't know, the leaves weren't pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't look nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looked messy to me and I didn't
like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really see much more of a
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would rather top than fem just for
aesthetic reasons only.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've done it accidentally numerous
times, countless number of times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really for those folks that aren't too
familiar with what femming is,
[SPEAKER_02]: really, it's kind of like a topping but
you top it the wrong spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You top a little bit too high and instead
of it splitting into two branches,
[SPEAKER_02]: it can go into three, it can go into four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you go more than just the two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've had multiple times where I just
got three branches out of it, which I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like, oh, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was always going to be four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can actually just split out into three
different branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the story behind it is actually wrong
in a sense to where a lot of people say
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a story behind femming is that some
guy tried to top and he missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, F, I missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Insert the swear word there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But F, I missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so that's where fem came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I actually recently learned from Kyle
Cushman that he had mentioned in a podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: episode I would do with him that that
actually isn't the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really somebody who submitted a
question into high times and they signed
[SPEAKER_02]: their name fem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so yeah, it's kind of funny to see how
that story was just randomly created and
[SPEAKER_02]: now that's not actually it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, he would tell more details on it
if you guys want to warp back to the
[SPEAKER_02]: episode I did with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's timestamps on every episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you should be able to click right into
when we talk about femming and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: hear the story behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I definitely didn't say it
properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably butchered it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, yeah, apparently
somebody signed the name fem.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't actually F.
[SPEAKER_02]: I missed.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's how these urban legends
are created.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like the whole myth about how
420 was created.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many different versions of
the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we've heard them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, how do you know which one's
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You just assume.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to supercropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that something you do at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love my supercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the Cushman chiropractic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is something I, that snap, that pop
that you hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just it brings me so much joy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to I like to supercrop as soon
as it's I like to do it right before I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: about ready to go into flower,
maybe about a week or so when when the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has the structure and is ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm like, OK, I know I'm you're
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get in there and I'll start from the
very bottom and I'll pinch the branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: With one hand on each side and I'll give
it a little twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like he he he says it's like like
the chiropractic, like you're you're
[SPEAKER_01]: popping the spine and I'll do that to each
and every branch and I'll start right at
[SPEAKER_01]: the very bottom and I'll go all the way
right up to the very tippy tippy top.
And.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only caveat I would suggest is don't
water right before you're about to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, because you can snap off a branch a
little bit easier if there's a lot of
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside your plants, if they just had a
nice big drink and you give it a pop,
[SPEAKER_01]: the pop is a little bit more satisfying,
but you you run the risk of breaking a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody's got to do like an ASMR video
with just the cracks that are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never if you've never
experienced it before, just do yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: one one favor and just do that one little
twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: One hand on each side of the branch and
just give it a little twist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much, just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just enough to hear that pop and so
satisfying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you only doing like a pop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still like the branch still kind of
staying up straight or you like
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulating enough to where it's a
flopping over?
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I've done all of my
training to where my plant is exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: where I want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't I don't usually do a super crop
to the point where I'm flopping the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches over unless I need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually all of my training is done
free going into this stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the the plant is a beautiful globe
shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just popping those branches to
make sure that they she's got those
[SPEAKER_01]: knuckles to to be able to hold up the
weight later on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I heard from other
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was pigeons for 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned he does the same exact thing
to where every single branch in order to
[SPEAKER_02]: try to strengthen up the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way, when they're flowering,
they're able to hold up those big fat buds
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot easier than if you didn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that I haven't done on
every single branch before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe one grow I will do just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's content, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I use super cropping a little bit
differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really only in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use it just in the first three weeks of
stretch, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the plant is still stretching upward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if I'm not able to do low stress
training because I'm still trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain that can even canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those first three weeks of flower
on the lead cycles change, plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: still stretching, the heights are changing
right for each of the branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can't bend them all down and keep
them even, well, sometimes those center
[SPEAKER_02]: branches, those ones I can't really just
pull down with a low stress train.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'll do is I'll do a super crop,
let that let those branches flop over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the outer branches really will
continue to grow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it will kind of be even.
[SPEAKER_02]: The goal is really to have it even by the
end of the stretch phase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really the only way I use super
cropping myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the goal out of all of this
training is to get that even canopy to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the maximum light available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the maximum we can from the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it could be so helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's move on to lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now lollipopping is categorized into the
training area, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People say, Oh, it's actually pruning.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pruning technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a training technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, let's just include in the
conversation, whatever way you think about
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's include in let's talk about
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is lollipopping?
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you do it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love a clean leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love a clean leg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lollipopping is taking the the foliage
from the bottom of the bottom of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way up to the canopy to where you
would like your canopy to begin and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: to help maximize the airflow in side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always I always tease on our on our
shows that that I it's Friday night get
[SPEAKER_01]: your get your legs shaved because that's
another term for it is shaving up the legs
[SPEAKER_01]: shaving up the girls to have that bottom
area nice and clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's you you helps with pests,
it helps with airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so much it's just a clean, nice clean
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when do you typically do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughout the life, actually,
as as much as I can, I will try and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: those that center area as clean as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right before flower in that in that
week or so right before flower is when I
[SPEAKER_01]: just strip those girls right up and give
them a real good training session.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and really, that's the that's the key
is right before about a week before
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers to get all of this done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the plant has time to recover
before it has to start focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: creating those big, beautiful buds that we
all want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm the same way I'll do it right
before flipping the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes really during stretch phase,
the first three weeks, there still can be
[SPEAKER_02]: some growth down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm usually going in around,
you know, day 14 to 20 something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, to where I'm doing another strip of
the lowers and it's not as much right,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done the bulk of the work before
flipping the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a little bit cleanup that can
still happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as the plants continue on from
there into flower, you can get little buds
[SPEAKER_02]: that kind of form down on the lowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm usually plucking those off as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so I'm just like you were kind
of doing a little bit throughout the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's I find it's just maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm in there and I'm I'm seeing a spot
that needs to be cleaned up, just take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just saves your work later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that energy is being focused
where we want it to not where,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when nobody wants to trim the
larv, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you get rid of it,
just get get those big, beautiful flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's the goal we that's
that's what we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it definitely helps with the upper
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, all the larv just ends up in my
trim pile these days.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't trim that anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to, but my standards have gotten a
little bit higher since then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ends up my trim pile or you know,
I could end up in a compost pile as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So either or another thing that's kind of
looped into a training category.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people say, hey, no, it's pruning
is defoliation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is defoliation?
[SPEAKER_02]: And when do you go about doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, defoliation is just getting rid of
those big fan leaves that are covering up
[SPEAKER_01]: what you are trying to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you you you want to like I said
earlier, try and keep a clean,
[SPEAKER_01]: a clean space and get that airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have too many leaves on top of
each other, you can get micro clients and
[SPEAKER_01]: get clients climates, excuse me,
and moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're you're opening yourself up
to problems at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to keep that airflow is to
defoliate to get rid of the the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: that are going to be a problem later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to defoliate again that that right
before flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I give them a really big stripping,
but I'm actually doing it throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to prevent those microclimates
from showing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've never I've never had
an issue with powdery mildew, thank
[SPEAKER_01]: goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's something I because I live in a
lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of moisture in the air and
we have a lot of foliage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of green in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something I try to prevent as much
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And defoliating, keeping a clean airflow
canopy is is the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, laid veg really before flipping a
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty heavy defoliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I do that flip.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then within the first three weeks,
that stretch period foliage is still
[SPEAKER_02]: continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oftentimes I am to plucking off leaves,
looking to pluck them off day seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: 1421.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are roughly the days where I
typically am just looking at the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, hey, is there anything that needs
to be removed at this point?
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to make sure there's airflow going
through the canopy, making sure there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not if there's stagnant spots within the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good area for pests to
congregate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's no we don't leave room for
those pests to party.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no partying in our tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then sometimes what I'll do is and
it's genetic dependent, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some strains are going to be more
bushier than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes I'm at day like 45 and flower
and I'm like, you know what, I can pluck
[SPEAKER_02]: off some leaves at this point and get some
light to come more down into the canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: and touch some of those bud sites there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of I personally go about
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty similar to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to go from the top as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people look from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes if you just put your head
over top of the canopy and just pretend
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like the light looking down and
think, okay, where can I get, where can I
[SPEAKER_01]: get some, some area?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could just be one or two leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've just maximized your growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the Scrog technique?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever done that before?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried, but it's so frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked, I like to move my plants around
and, and to be able to shift things around
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and to have things stuck in one spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a little difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I have tried, but it's just not my,
it's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, no, I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's, it can have its own unique
challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, for those folks that don't know what
Scrog is, it's basically just putting a
[SPEAKER_02]: net into your grow space, flat across your
grow space, and then training your plants
[SPEAKER_02]: within that net.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people will weave branches in and
out of the net.
[SPEAKER_02]: Others will just tuck under the net
entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep tucking, keep tucking all the way
into flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people stop doing the tucking at like
day seven of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people stop at day 14 of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's, it's really subjective on when
you stop talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after that, you just get the upwards
growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the idea is that you've filled up that
net entirely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of maximizing the growth space
and you're resulting really in an even
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something I've tried a couple of
times in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm not a yield guy anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I first started growing,
sure I was going for yield and measuring
[SPEAKER_02]: things out and trying to get higher and
higher yield, but I'm just growing for
[SPEAKER_02]: myself now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I have friends and family that
come into town, so I don't really need
[SPEAKER_02]: yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just get what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just growing the plants with regular
training, other, other types of training,
[SPEAKER_02]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, uh, it's something that I kind of
shied away for, although there are
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely several good benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the main ones being is the higher
yield doing the Scrog technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, there's a different way to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty is each person,
um, you know, has their own way of
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Troy kills it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Scrogger kills it with the
Scrogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's his thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, it's, that's what works
for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure he's tried other methods to
find what works for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each person, that's why it's so
wonderful that we have such an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: community right now that we can talk about
all our different methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find what works for you,
you know, and you can take a little piece
[SPEAKER_01]: from here, a little piece from there and,
and build your own.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing that we have this
platform.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so beneficial to be able to see all
the different ways to do it and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of picking and choosing what you
want to implement in your own garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a big shout out to Troy, Northern
Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he is really, we can consider him
an expert at this point at the Scrog
[SPEAKER_02]: technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he literally has a show called Scrog
School.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's teaching people step-by-step on how
to do the Scrog technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody's interested in that and
happen to not know who Troy is or Northern
[SPEAKER_02]: Scrogger, just search for him on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll come up with a Scrog School and,
um, it's really, really detailed class on
[SPEAKER_02]: how to Scrog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he has a really, really great result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if, even if you don't are not
interested, in Scrogging, he has a way of
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching about the plant that is just so
captivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it just, if you're not
interested in Scrogging, even just learn,
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from him about the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just bow down to Troy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, Scrog technique, S C R O G stands
for screen of green.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also SOG, S O G C of green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever done that method before?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have in the past and that's,
that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you just take a, a bunch of small
plants and you fill up as much as the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be careful with that one
though, because sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they start off little, you forget that
they can double or triple in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to make sure you leave enough
room, room to groove in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe the, uh, the rule of thumb is
50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you cover 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, uh, your veg plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then your, or your floor space in veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then by the time that they grow and
they, they bloom, they will be a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent in your, in your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to, I like to grow big plants
myself, but I have tried it before for
[SPEAKER_01]: fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you can get a lot of flavors in
one small tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a method that I actually haven't
tried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should put it on my bucket list.
[SPEAKER_02]: To try out in the future though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it just seems like such a cool
technique does seem like a lot of work if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're hand watering, but if you're doing
like an ebb and flow system, like you've
[SPEAKER_02]: got, I'm sure it makes things a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, I think you get the best result
if you're doing it from clone,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they're all kind of the same,
uh, you know, coming from the same mother
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and you should see similar growth
across all the plants versus if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing from seed or even different
cultivars, it could kind of make things
[SPEAKER_02]: uneven as far as your canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oftentimes it's generally recommended
to be from clone all the same across the
[SPEAKER_02]: board.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I wanted to ask about
actually is lighting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, uh, how does this relate to training?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, some folks say that they reduce the
amount of lighting when they're doing some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these training methods, whether it be
high stress training or low stress
[SPEAKER_02]: training that they're reducing a little
bit because they don't, they want the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants to kind of recover from the
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like the light output should
be kind of lowered or changed at all while
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing plant training?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't adjust my lighting for the
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, unless I can see my, if my girls are
stressed and they are not bouncing back
[SPEAKER_01]: from the training, then I will adjust the
lighting and I'll give them a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll, I'll, I'll lower that lighting and,
and give them, but you know, the sun
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't, the sun doesn't stop shining
because the wind is blowing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: These, these girls have got to,
if they're in my garden, they better stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you're not strong,
you're out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Sparta in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only time I would adjust the
lighting for training is if I saw,
[SPEAKER_01]: I went too hard and they were not bouncing
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I will lower the lighting a little
bit and give them a cloudy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until I see that, that they're get,
get their footing again and then bring
[SPEAKER_01]: them back up again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what about the temperature and
humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing anything differently in the
environment where you're training plants
[SPEAKER_02]: versus not training plants or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, everything's I, I just keep
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have everything all dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just stays there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I, once I have it dialed in,
I don't like to fuss and must with things
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's when problems happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you'll, you'll adjust something
and then do something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you, you can't figure out what
happened and, and where the problem arise.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try and keep everything as simple as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so everything just stays the same
in, I, I adjust the humidity and stuff for
[SPEAKER_01]: flour and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only two times I change.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you typically aim for,
for temperature and humidity throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, during a veg, I like to keep it at
about, um, 80, 75 to 80% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going to talk in a Celsius cause I
am Canadian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the conversion is,
but I like to keep it around, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: 26 to 27 degrees in the, in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so not, not too hot, but nice,
a nice summer day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep it a nice summer day,
nice balmy spring summer day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for flour, I, I keep the same
temperature and then I bring my humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: down to about 50%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing the conversion here,
he said 26, which is 78.8 degrees and then
[SPEAKER_02]: 27 degrees Celsius is 80.6 degrees
according to Google conversion here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those that are in Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to think, are there any
other plant training methods that we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't talk about that you'd like to
discuss?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I do like to do one thing,
um, to my girls that, uh, is not very
[SPEAKER_01]: typical, but I like to take a leaf blower
to my girls and I have an indoor leap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not an indoor, it's an outdoor
leaf blower, but I have it indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in, in my setup and I take the leaf
blower and I actually have this part of my
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of my IPM and it's part training
both.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take my leaf blower and I will blow
the tent and these girls are swaying and
[SPEAKER_01]: moving and it's like a, like a hurricane
in the, in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, the girls always respond with a
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day they are stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are, you know, praying to the light
gods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I'll do that and then I'll spray
with IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's anything sitting on those
leaves, they're getting blown right off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I spray, I'll fog the tent and
zip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I never have a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just see them swaying in the wind.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: What age, how long has a plant been
growing for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're usually in good veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they are good six weeks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got some good roots on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been able to take my abuse up
until then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's like, all right,
let's see how far we can take you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and they always thank me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't sure if you were doing it for
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be blowing seedlings right out of the
medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never heard of anybody doing that
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a video of that by chance?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe on your Instagram or something?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do actually on my, on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I have it actually posted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I've got it pinned, pinned is the
word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it pinned to the top of my reels
on Mama Kush 420 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Mama Kush 420 on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go on there and check out the
pinned one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: What advice do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: What advice do you have for beginners who
are training their plants for the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants want to grow and they have
survived millennia before we showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, uh, if you're, you're concerned to
start slow, start slow, just start with a
[SPEAKER_01]: slight bend and see how, and see how,
how they respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really these girls can take a lot,
a lot, a leaf blower.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, please don't be afraid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have questions, there's people
out there that are willing to help you
[SPEAKER_01]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't be afraid to ask questions
or investigate or just try, just get your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands in there and try.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's, uh, let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us how the listeners can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so Mama Kush 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: On Instagram is my main page.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a backup page in case Instagram
decides to take me down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's mama Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, 2.0 is my backup account.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only have the one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so if anybody's trying to impersonate
me, I only have the one backup account.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can reach me also at home,
grow the community official on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a weekly podcast on Wednesdays,
uh, over on YouTube home, grow the
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Friday, nights we do a special,
uh, grow me gardens where we get to see
[SPEAKER_01]: the gardens of the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come onto the show and ask
questions and show their grow and come and
[SPEAKER_01]: hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a little campfire afterwards where
we can just sit and hang out and just
[SPEAKER_01]: chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that's home, grow the community on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we we're all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, definitely have link to Mama Kush's
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down in the YouTube description section
below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're tuning in on one of the
podcast platforms, just search for,
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll find her mama Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for coming on to the
episode today to talk about plant
[SPEAKER_02]: trainings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there are so many different ways
to go about this process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really just got to try things out and
figure it out on your own.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how much your plants can take and take
it slow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she had mentioned, anybody can really
have success to implant training as long
[SPEAKER_02]: as they give it a shot and be patient with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, I'm tingling right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Glad you enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let you go and, uh, yeah,
peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
Okay.
