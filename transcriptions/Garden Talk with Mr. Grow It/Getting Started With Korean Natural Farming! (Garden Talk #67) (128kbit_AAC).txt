[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could know nothing when you started
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that three-letter acronym,
go watch my YouTube on it, and make it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the next hour and be applying it to your
garden successfully in 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's not as fine as a blender can
make something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as fine as a microbe eating it and
passing it through its enzymatic process
[SPEAKER_01]: and spitting out the raw materials or the
plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how fine it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Product, when finished correctly,
is better than anything you can buy on the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the cost of a potato and a few grams
of salt, you're going to have something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's more than $100 a gallon in value.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 67.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you know him from KNF,
which are natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Millions of people have watched his
natural farming videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thousands have gone through his in-depth
courses, and he's even taught these
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques in several countries across the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we get into some of the
natural farming techniques that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Spider Farmer for being a
sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new grow light they released here in
2022 is the SE1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was designed specifically for those
of you who run CO2 into grow space and
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to maximize the light
intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a 10 bar design for an even light
spread, pulls 1000 watts from the wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and comes in at 2.9 micromoles per joule
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recommended coverage area is 4 feet by
4 feet or 5 feet by 5 feet.

below.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is a sponsor of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coupon code MRGROWIT will get you a
discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their Cloudline T6 and T4
inline fans for several years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I absolutely love the automation built
into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inline fans controller,
you can have set points for high and low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, as well as high and low
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This greatly helps control my indoor
garden environment, so the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity stays in the ideal ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to AC Infinity down in
the description below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget to use coupon code

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk all about KNF,
so KNF, Korean Natural Farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was actually a couple people on my
podcast in the past that talked about a
[SPEAKER_00]: few of the KNF methods, so I want to give
a shout out to them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green's Goddess and also Bluegrass Green
Thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if those names are familiar to
you or not, but both of them have actually
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned your name as who they learned it
from, and they had suggested that I have
[SPEAKER_00]: you on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are today, getting you on the
podcast, and we'll talk about some various
[SPEAKER_00]: KNF methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw Green's Goddess in Denver last
week, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a little meetup and yeah,
they're good people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we get too deep into the KNF
methods, let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was born on the big island of Hawaii,
and I was born on a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing some livestock as a kid,
and my dad, when I was pretty young,
[SPEAKER_01]: got into macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after college and some work,
I decided to go back to farming and helped
[SPEAKER_01]: my family farm transition to organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned natural farming in the process
as we needed a tool that made more sense
[SPEAKER_01]: than traditional organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I managed our 750-acre macadamia
farm with my dad for about eight years,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then have been involved since the last
six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brothers now manage it, and they're
doing a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I've since then managed a
three-acre farm in Idaho for a while and
[SPEAKER_01]: have popped all around in different places
in the world and in the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: working with farmers and teaching how to
tend to microbialize the soil and partner
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty deep down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere along the line, I think,
in managing our farm and having to sort
[SPEAKER_01]: out the details of what we were doing in
our process, I think I probably got a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple degrees in microbiology just
continuing to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had the opportunity to advise a
doctorate thesis program in Korea,
[SPEAKER_01]: Konguk University.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was asked to be on the research and
development board for the International
[SPEAKER_01]: Macadamia Society.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the work on our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spoke in China a few times over the
last few years, up until 2020,
[SPEAKER_01]: to rooms full of scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think I've really come to have
an appreciation for the need for systemic
[SPEAKER_01]: change and the part I get to play in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of my audience probably
knows you from your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at your channel right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got over 40,000 subscribers just on
YouTube alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what other platforms you're
on, but you're really one of the pioneers
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to bringing KNF over to the
States and kind of bringing it to a wide
[SPEAKER_00]: audience, I guess we should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of these videos are back from
2016, 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click on, one thing I just want
to point out is if you go to his channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris Trump, just search for it on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playlists, there is 21 videos under a
Chris Trump, how to create natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this playlist alone, I think is kind
of really monumental to the move of create
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much detail on how to do
these practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're in a simplified form that's
easy for a new grower to digest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hats off to you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, your work is definitely noticed
by a large audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm definitely excited to have you on
today and ready to start getting into some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these practices so people can make that
transition over from bottled nutrients or
[SPEAKER_00]: even organic over to some more natural
farming techniques, such as the Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, 40,000, I think just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks to all you watchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start from the beginning and assume
that people don't really know what KNF is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about what is KNF and
why should gardeners implement KNF
[SPEAKER_00]: practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, it's only in the US that we add
the word Korean to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because of how we came to know
it, being Master Cho, who is the creator
[SPEAKER_01]: of the current practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: His full name is Cho Han-kyu, and Cho
being the last name, Han-kyu being his
[SPEAKER_01]: first name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's a Korean man, lives outside of
Seoul now with his son, who is Cho
[SPEAKER_01]: Young-sun, and who's the creator of JDOM
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of a little background,
this family has done a lot to kind of open
[SPEAKER_01]: source share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Master Cho, Master kind of like
Sensei, and if we were in a martial arts
[SPEAKER_01]: class, Master's teacher, and it's a title
kind of like Doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their work and then the freedom to
kind of share open source is really,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, culturally the gift in natural
farming and something that I feel like is
[SPEAKER_01]: an important thing to continue and to pass
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something I teach when I teach
classes, like look how you've received
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no secret sauce being hidden and
held back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be fifth level to learn the
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like here, it's open and freely
shared and nothing held back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think, culturally something
that is really important because I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's part of the change that's needed in
the world, is that this isn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure some people make a living and there's
things to sell and teach and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, once you have that
knowledge, there's no copyright on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a clause or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a real honor to have
learned that way and to be able to pass
[SPEAKER_01]: that on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess just a little footnote or
stopping there for a minute at that
[SPEAKER_01]: important detail that is in natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's practiced in, I think,
over 70 countries that I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of that history is Master Cho
traveling and teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: He got some political persecution
following the Korean War because there was
[SPEAKER_01]: such free sharing of agricultural
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They marked him as a communist and so
there was a lot of pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he actually had to leave the
country for a while under that pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: and went to India and Thailand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those places, it's just called
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I often refer to it as natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because of that, I've gotten to
travel a lot and experience those
[SPEAKER_01]: communities and those different cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Japanese natural farming community is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of great kind of innovation,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not a lot of it's in English,
sadly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But natural farming is a elegant method to
partner with nature to grow food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of traditional
farming technology that's incredible and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get to that same place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the nice thing about natural farming
is it's this beautiful package.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get this box of technology and the
whole thing gives you everything you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to really be highly effective as a
gardener to produce your crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's really a special
aspect of what's available in natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming is just the kind of you can master
this one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really, one of the other things
that it is, is it's a key to understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just to be able to do step by step a
recipe, but all of a sudden you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, that's how fermentation works and why
it's valuable and I can use this to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I can add live this now that I've
mastered that, I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's a key to understanding
natural law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as much as it's a farming
technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's a series of recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main one being this IMO process where
you take indigenous, IMO stands for
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microorganism, where you're
taking a diverse microbial community from
[SPEAKER_01]: a wild spot in nature and reestablishing
it in your farmland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that plus some of these nutrients you
can make in-house and expensively creates
[SPEAKER_01]: a wonderful tool for growing food or
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of folks in my
audience in particular that are bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're synthetic or mineral based
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself was a bottled grower for six
years and then I transitioned over,
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned organic gardening, whether it be
an organic blend or organic dry
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm kind of looking into the
natural farming approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So admittedly, I haven't yet started any
natural farming methods, been learning
[SPEAKER_00]: about it this year and I'm going to
actually start taking that leap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we continue to go on here,
know that I'm a newbie when it comes to it
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of my audience are newbies when
it comes to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are several benefits,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, getting off the bottles,
you can certainly save some money going
[SPEAKER_00]: into the natural farming approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save some time as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to mix up nutrients each
time you're ready to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to pH, adjust the pH,
monitor the PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's a more sustainable approach
to horticulture compared to the bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the most common issues
around the world right now is the
[SPEAKER_00]: over-fertilization and the runoff of
nitrogen and phosphorus into our lakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: streams causing toxic algae blooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural farming doesn't contribute to
that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's tons of benefits out there for
transitioning from either bottles or even
[SPEAKER_00]: organic over to a natural farming
approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to say that first before
we kind of move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One word that you mentioned that I think
is going to throw people off a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: is fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fermentation, we hear about
fermentation, we know it's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaerobic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And general speaking, a lot of folks know
that anaerobic conditions can lead to bad
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and pests, particularly like in
your growing medium, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we're not talking about anaerobic
process within the medium, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about it within other things
such as FPJ, FFJ, your fermented plant
[SPEAKER_00]: juice, fermented fruit juice, et cetera,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about like what is
fermentation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how you use it in natural farming
practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my journey growing up on the farm is
much the same as yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a conventional farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bottled nutrients that came in a
40-foot container and just 30,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, 30 fertilizer and Roundup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even up until 2011, when we really
started transitioning to natural farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: we were a split operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 50% of the farm, about 400 acres was
conventional, still Roundup and salt
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then 50% was organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And organic was struggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not nutrient rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't productive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have much the same journey in my
farming experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to transition to natural farming
and see it be both cost effective and
[SPEAKER_01]: production effective was really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, fun to share that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fermentation is, I think, I'll use fish
fertilizer as an example to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: explain the concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go to the store and buy
hydrolysate and or fish emulsion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are processes where they're
taking out an oil or a prime product from
[SPEAKER_01]: fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making fish oil capsules or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the leftovers, they're throwing
through an industrial blender and cooking
[SPEAKER_01]: down till they get a kind of homogenized
liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That on a microscopic scale, that is
unprocessed giant chunks of fish flesh,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at it under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as a plant leaf is concerned,
that is undigested, unprocessed fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just taking a fish paste,
if you spray it on your plant and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: smearing a fish paste onto your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that fish that's been applied to
the leaf has to go through a breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: process where it's going to get washed off
the leaves and fall on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be fermented, digested in
place in nature through the microbes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are there and then become plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little of that is immediately plant
available until it goes through a
[SPEAKER_01]: digestive process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much like the digestion that occurs in our
stomach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nature and plant assimilation of nutrients
is very much the same as human
[SPEAKER_01]: assimilation of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And human assimilation of nutrients
doesn't happen without microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have blades in our guts.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing chopping up our food,
turning into ADP and ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's microbial decomposition along with
enzymatic processes that make our food
[SPEAKER_01]: assimilatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can digest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same thing happens in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buying these bottled fish nutrients,
they still have to go through a breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: process to become plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't mean that a little bit is not
available initially, but that breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: does occur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fermented fish amino acid,
which is the natural farming fish
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer, takes whole fish or fish guts
and heads and heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry if I'm jumping into the weirdest,
grossest thing right away, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll help with understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that if I just take
blended fish and I throw it on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface, bacteria rises up and I get
anaerobic conditions happening as that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of breakdown and putrefies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in natural farming, we take a
diverse fungal inoculum, IMO, and we
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce it with a balanced amount by
weight of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put the fish and the sugar and this
IMO together and this very slow
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation occurs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually takes a year to be perfectly
done where the fungi actually breaks down
[SPEAKER_01]: and yanks apart these fatty acid chains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this material when it's finished is
completely assimilatable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely plant digestible.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a foliar application in the root zone,
it doesn't have to go through a secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: breakdown process for it to be usable to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've pre-done that in fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what occurs is something and this is in
FDJ and in these fermentation process,
[SPEAKER_01]: something called micronization,
where it's not as fine as a blender can
[SPEAKER_01]: make something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as fine as a microbe eating it and
passing it through its enzymatic process
[SPEAKER_01]: and spitting out the raw materials or the
plant nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how fine it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the difference from a Mack
truck to a marble on a microbiological or
[SPEAKER_01]: on a micronization scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spraying hydrolysate on your leaves,
you sprayed Mack trucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those need to be broken down to marbles so
they can pass through the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: In FAA, we've already gone down through
that micronization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's the size of marbles,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I hope that kind of helps into
why we mess around with fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more to it, but that's maybe a
crash course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking to that aerobic versus anaerobic,
aerobic is what we want in our root zone,
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is that anaerobic and
aerobic processes happen in root zones all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a pocket of nutrients in a
forest, leaves fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That initial layer, if a big windstorm
comes, leaves pile up in a corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of the center of that becomes
anaerobic and that's how those nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: get processed down that path.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-processing then becomes ready food for
the aerobic microbes then to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: and eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really neat that it's a whole
picture of nature and not just there's
[SPEAKER_01]: good guys and bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's coming to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the new folks, what natural farming
practice do you suggest that gardeners
[SPEAKER_00]: start with first?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a best and I would say
in general, begin to learn and master the
[SPEAKER_01]: process of making IMO4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is literally going to be,
I tell people it's going to be about a
[SPEAKER_01]: year learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to spend about a year
learning how to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Begin that journey so that you're not
starting a year from now on a year
[SPEAKER_01]: learning journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just trust that there'll be failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're learning guitar,
totally worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a ton of fun, but a learning journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But real easy entry, easy to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Master Cho's son.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because we're in IMO,
we're producing this full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial microbial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Master Cho's son, you know,
learned this, sat with farmers and said,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this is too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's challenging, which I don't fully
agree with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it is challenging, but not too
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also, in his approach to it,
decided he wanted to make something
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came up with something called JMS,
Jadam microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes potatoes and a little bit of
rice and some microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can brew out in 24 to 36 hours in
a bucket in your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is full of yeast and beneficial
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have a ton of fungi in it other
than whatever just washes off your initial
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is pretty low hanging fruit as
far as you could know nothing when you
[SPEAKER_01]: started this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that three letter acronym,
go watch my YouTube on it and make it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the next hour and be applying it to your
garden successfully in 36 hours with no
[SPEAKER_01]: learning curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say that is a great way to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that product, when
finished correctly, is better than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you can buy on the shelf as far
as bugs in a jug microbial solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the cost of a potato and a few
grams of salt, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's more than $100 a gallon
in value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would say JMS is a great way to
condition your soil and get those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, learn that IMO process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then liquid IMO can be made with an
IMO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably an easy thing to jump into
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now my teacher, Master Cho,
teaches when he teaches natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get a little bit deeper into IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned IMO4, but I know there's
like IMO1, IMO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So correct me if I'm wrong, these are
different stages of IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already kind of touched base on what
IMO is, indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how do you make it and how do you use
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a untouched forest, a thousand years
of just being left alone, balance gets
[SPEAKER_01]: struck in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The blacksmith moves to town, the doctor
moves to town, the grocer, the farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: the transporter, all of these players have
now struck a balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think the Wild West and the small prairie
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody needs to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have the whole picture of the
community, everybody doing their part and
[SPEAKER_01]: all necessary and all very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: In nature, in an untouched area,
in an area that's healthy and diverse,
[SPEAKER_01]: those things those balances have happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we can do as farmers cultivating
life is we can go to these areas and
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest that diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of capture it and bring it into our
farming systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the ways we do that is this
IMO1 process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we go out into the forest with some
rice and that rice has a high fat protein
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's good fungal food.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an auger for fungi to grow on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that bloom now ideally has wonderful
diversity from nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just got the great gift of being
able to submit samples a bunch of my
[SPEAKER_01]: students submitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Samples to a DNA mapping lab where they
map the DNA of a bunch of IMO4.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had some 200 species of fungi in a
single handful of IMO4 and some 800
[SPEAKER_01]: species of bacteria and yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just an incredible array of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just through this simple process,
like you said, it is stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So IMO1 is rice in a forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO2 is the process of causing that IMO1
to go dormant, which is important because
[SPEAKER_01]: if we're not using it right away,
we don't want it to continue to cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: down, if you will, and lose diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want it to kind of stay as a
cryo-freeze snapshot of the diversity that
[SPEAKER_01]: we got in that day one out of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we mix it with rice kind of like
you put fish and salt for a long sea
[SPEAKER_01]: voyage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps it from breaking down over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that IMO2 is kind of the stabilization
of the IMO1.
[SPEAKER_01]: IMO3 is taking a small amount of that and
causing it to grow out on a substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use rice bran and oats are kind of the
ideal substrate along with wood chips and
[SPEAKER_01]: then some nutrients like humic acid,
sea salt, FPGA, OHC, brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these natural farming nutrients,
it's kind of creating a party for microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: to thrive in and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then IMO4, we bring some of our farms
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're growing indoors, you could
actually take some of your potting soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and include that in the grow out process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you come up with incredible,
incredible final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the time you get to the fourth stage of
IMO1, the final process, you have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: wonderful and diverse product that's never
gonna shock your plants and it moves right
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a giant engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're building kind of an engine and the
components are all these microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so once you get it going, now it's
cycling nutrients and you can take a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil garden bed and just top dress
it with kind of raw compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that microbial life in there just
starts processing it and it's like gas to
[SPEAKER_01]: the engine, just keeps it going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have very little effort needed to
feed your plants other than maybe you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got a Bokashi barrel where you throw your
food scraps in and you just top dress your
[SPEAKER_01]: leftovers from your dinners and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your nutrients for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason that works and just doesn't
become a stinky mass is because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this diverse microbial community and then
earthworms are gonna be able to thrive
[SPEAKER_01]: there because they eat those microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it becomes a really a living
system like nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're taking natural law and
partnering with it using the building
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks of soil, which are really the
builders are these microbes and they are
[SPEAKER_01]: what caused soil to be something other
than dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It becomes a living ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in the natural farming process,
we can kind of create and capture that
[SPEAKER_01]: system and use it to our advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So IMO4, what's your general
recommendation for application for
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a short video called Applying
Natural IMO Application or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you take this solid material and you
apply it at about 330 pounds per quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: acre or about a gallon for 100 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a 10 by 10 bed would have about a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it as like cover crop seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking all these fungal spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at it under the microscope,
it's full of just marbles, little fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: You throw it out on your soil with a
little bit of moisture and it wakes up and
[SPEAKER_01]: blooms and moves in and multiplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's really just an inoculum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very high quality inoculum,
like nothing you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so yeah, a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could top dress as much as an inch,
a solid inch of this material and it
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have more, apply more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another way to go about it is you take
that finished material.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can store it in like grandma's cedar
chest, you know, that blanket chest or a
[SPEAKER_01]: little lunch box you make or something out
of cedar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you use a handful of that in a brew
for like a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can cause it to bloom in a water
column in the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can spray that foliarly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like that because in nature we
have all these microbes actually live in
[SPEAKER_01]: the phyllosphere of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the leaves, if you look at it under
a microscope, it's covered in fungi and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria and yeast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually is its protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the same thing going on in our
skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: We exude, we have, you know, salts and
nutrients coming out of our pores and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's lactic acid bacteria and all these
other microbes that actually thrive on
[SPEAKER_01]: that materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And live symbiotically in our skin and we
rely on them for protection from disease
[SPEAKER_01]: and plants are the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like liquid IMO for that purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquid IMO for a lot of like medicinal
plants and even just general gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're applying that at about once a week
foliarly with great effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible effect just by applying that
once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that you mentioned was lab,
lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to get into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did watch your video on that on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So straightforward, so easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about lactic acid
bacteria?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you use it, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lactic acid bacteria is this incredible
part of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our system, we're outnumbered about one
trillion to one for every human cell.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a trillion microbe cells in our
bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 70% of those are lactobacilli family
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our gut is mostly lactobacilli
family microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without those, we don't do very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We desperately need lactic acid bacteria
to process our nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like a trash collector or
digester.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a facultative anaerobe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they thrive in both anaerobic and
aerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a very important, absolutely vital
part of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You die.
[SPEAKER_01]: All human life ceases without lactobacilli
family microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have names for the medical conditions
when you get those.
[SPEAKER_01]: That diversity knocked out in your gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a medical process called FMT,
fecal microbiota transplant, where if
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's gut biome gets knocked out
through extenuating circumstances or
[SPEAKER_01]: antibiotics or something like that,
we actually take the healthy gut biome of
[SPEAKER_01]: a healthy person, freeze dry it,
put it in capsules, and give it as a
[SPEAKER_01]: digestible pill or suppository to the
unhealthy person, reestablishes diversity,
[SPEAKER_01]: and now they can digest their food again.
[SPEAKER_01]: In China, I met the guy who came up with
FMT.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was tickled pink because I actually
incorporated it in my speech to the my
[SPEAKER_01]: peers in macadamia nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so room full of 500 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's just like, I can't believe you
brought it into agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But lactic acid bacteria is good for human
health and plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be a lot of people,
really kind of things I heard on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet, they take LAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like the one thing they take away
from the natural farming process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say that's kind of like taking
5% of the story and running with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have great success and they
report all kinds of wonderful things just
[SPEAKER_01]: by using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is a small part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In IMO production, so in the whole IMO4
process, you have all the LAB you'll ever
[SPEAKER_01]: need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're making liquid IMO,
chock full of LAB.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you don't really need to do the LAB
kind of process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I use LAB for, even though I'm
farming with IMO, is I make it and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the fridge and I consume it
regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For people with GI gastrointestinal
issues, it's massively helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: For skin or topical health or kind of
subtopical health, people can take it and
[SPEAKER_01]: apply it to their skin and get huge relief
from stuff like yeast infections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Hoon Park, who's a peer of mine and a
good friend and somebody that really
[SPEAKER_01]: helped bring natural farming to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: has Crohn's disease and he's been
asymptomatic for over 10 years because he
[SPEAKER_01]: takes an ounce of LAB in his water with
every meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he, as a medical doctor,
when people come in with GI issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: he just gives them a sheet on how to make
LAB and says, go and drink this with your
[SPEAKER_01]: meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've had friends cry because they
ate food that they couldn't eat for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time without getting stomach,
you know, violent stomach cramps because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're inoculating their food,
pre-inoculating it with a sip of LAB that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually is the material to the very thing
necessary to digest their food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just, yeah, an incredible part of
nature, something that we all rely on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And natural farming gives a very simple
recipe on how to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to reiterate, for those wanting
step-by-step instructions on how to do
[SPEAKER_00]: LAB, I mean, we're kind of briefly talking
about it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Chris's
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below, or if you're listening to
one of the podcasts, platforms just search
[SPEAKER_00]: for his name, Chris Trump, and you can see
the playlist and you can see how he makes
[SPEAKER_00]: LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I noticed is that
you really don't need gloves or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see that there'll be a separation
process that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually use the, I guess,
cheese curds or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that for a different process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the remaining liquid that you
strained is your LAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned, you can actually
just drink that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be probably one of the
first things I make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seemed like it was pretty easy to make,
but like you mentioned, it's a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very small percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely not going to stop there
when it comes to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I tell people that natural
farming isn't something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like we're teaching some new
technology that we just discovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that, you know,
a hundred years ago, a lot of these things
[SPEAKER_01]: were well-known kind of tools for every
household.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how to make cheese, for example,
and consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was something that was a
basic food preservation if you had milk
[SPEAKER_01]: because you didn't have refrigeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of this is things that when we
had this kind of influx of chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture, we just said, oh,
grandpa's knowledge, 2,000 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural tradition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 30, 30, 30 fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what a lot of natural farming is,
it's new in that the package is this
[SPEAKER_01]: elegant thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Master Cho, you know, if you hear
stories, some things came to him in dreams
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are bits and pieces that are
definitely new.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the general concept of kind of using
natural law to grow food, but also to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume food, it's things we used to know
and have forgotten.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just coming back to, you know,
working with life, I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into FPJ and FFJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fermented plant juice and fermented
fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greens Goddess was one of the ones
that had talked about this on a previous
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she broke it down in a simple sense to
where you can use like FPJ for the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: stage and FFJ for the flour stage or vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember which one was which,
but those seem to be very important
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about what FPJ and FFJ
are, you know, how to make them and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of how to apply them in your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I think a lot of online,
Joe and Jim and Susie and John talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about natural farming, FPJ gets this kind
of high platform because it's so easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: make and because it is a plant food or new
plant nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of gotten a little bit more play
in the online space than we give it in
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do want to kind of nod towards that,
that FPJ, OHN, all this plant nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: processes where you're spraying on
nutrients, they are the 20% of natural
[SPEAKER_01]: farming, the 80% being IMO and the
microbes that you would get in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this JMS technology is talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just kind of a quick nod to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: FFJ, fermented fruit juice, is the getting
wild fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think to talk about in this space,
FPJ and FFJ, I think I need to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that I heard on the internet,
the misnomers real quick, because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend that learned FPJ and she
applied the FPJ as a plant nutrient to her
[SPEAKER_01]: house plant, just dumped it on the soil
and just on the edge of killing her house
[SPEAKER_01]: plant initially and quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: She made an aloe FPJ and applied it
straight to the roots at a very low
[SPEAKER_01]: dilution rate, kind of a lot of it and got
spotting on the leaves and disease and the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant hasn't recovered two, three months
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are saying, oh,
I can make this plant nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're just running with that as
like, oh, I have the answer to growing
[SPEAKER_01]: without bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to dump a bunch of FPJ on
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I'm getting into this, but it's so
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get these like, oh, I did this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, who told you to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, this website, you know,
and so FFJ is a very narrow kind of use
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can apply it in flowering,
but kind of towards the end or not
[SPEAKER_01]: abundantly, you can still use FPJ in that
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: What FPJ is, is think of it as a very high
end boutique liquid compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have this basically liquid nutrient
that you're able to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like making compost, the breakdown of
compost, you get those raw materials and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put them on plants and plants love
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: FPJ is like this, like caviar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of compost in liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things, and so what it is,
is it's going out and finding a weed or a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant that's green all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bugs leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows really quickly.
It grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's robust or grows vigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full of beneficial biochemicals that
cause it to be so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also, for whatever reason,
has figured out how to take nutrients from
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil very effectively so that it's not
struggling to be nutrient dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It thrives in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be different in Hawaii than
it is in Michigan or in Colorado or Idaho.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each place is going to have its own plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you need to do to really make FPJ
is go out and change your vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's got these blinders on,
these glasses that cause you not to see
[SPEAKER_01]: the weeds that you've seen your entire
life and just come to ignore.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at, oh, the pretty flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't see the, maybe if you're in
California by the coast, it's ice plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see the ice plant or the ivy or
the lamb's quarter or the amaranth or all
[SPEAKER_01]: these things that are weeds and we're
annoyed when they show up in our yard,
[SPEAKER_01]: dandelions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, that stuff is so vigorous,
so strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we harvest it and make plant food
out of it, we actually get the benefit of
[SPEAKER_01]: its abundant strength as a plant nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nearly free.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit of sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So free weeds and a little bit of sugar
becomes one of the best nutrients you can
[SPEAKER_01]: buy or apply to your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the process is pretty easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you don't want to do is
you don't want to go to the grocery store
[SPEAKER_01]: and buy a bunch of fruit and make it into
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people teaching that on the
internet and if it works for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mess around with the changes
people have made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think there's anything wrong
with that because it's still a nod at
[SPEAKER_01]: natural law.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still using some of this technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you think about it, in a forest
canopy or in grassland, the weeds lay
[SPEAKER_01]: down, they die off, they get digested,
they become plant food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're just doing that kind of
digestion process and using it as plant
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a simple way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're somewhat strapped on time
here, so I'll just hit you with a few more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions and then we'll wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to go over water-soluble
calcium, so WCA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: WCA is a great tool for bringing calcium
into your growing system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're using a calcium-rich material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So egg shells or coral sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like coral sand because you don't have
to cook it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or oyster shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use egg shells or oyster shells,
those were living things that have organic
[SPEAKER_01]: bonds and we have to trash those organic
bonds to use it, to get the calcium out of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cooking process destroys those
organic bonds so that we can do a chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the chemical reaction is a high
calcium or basic material reacting with a
[SPEAKER_01]: vinegar or acidic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: We combine those and it causes the basic
or alkaline material to react with the
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic material and causes it to go into
solution, which again micronizes it and
[SPEAKER_01]: makes it so the plant can receive it
through its cuticle, can receive it
[SPEAKER_01]: through its cell wall and its leaves,
or is really easy to digest in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a video on it, super simple to
do, and it's a low-cost way to get a very
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we produce is called calcium acetate
and it's not something you can readily buy
[SPEAKER_01]: at the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's partially because it's not a
patentable process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very simple DIY possible process,
but it's also a very high quality nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: for your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, WCA is easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it all the time and don't be afraid of
giving it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the shelf life on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make it properly, it lasts years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like improper would be if you undercook
the eggs, you'll have some of that organic
[SPEAKER_01]: material will get in there, kind of the
protein in the shell eggs cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: That organic material will putrefy and rot
over time and it'll start to stink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about the quality that you make it
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't take the membrane,
if you don't kind of winnow off the
[SPEAKER_01]: membrane on the inside of the egg shells
or pull off the membrane before you cook
[SPEAKER_01]: it, if you leave that membrane in there,
it's an organic material, it'll degrade
[SPEAKER_01]: the shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a variable depending on the
quality of your process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I make it a couple years,
if a newbie makes it and screws up,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what would the recommended
application rate be for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, we use that at one to a
thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of these natural parmine nutrients
are used at almost homeopathic amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like it's too little,
like more is more and people start
[SPEAKER_01]: applying extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that way in natural farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it the way it's talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like we were gonna talk, I don't know
if we have time, but we were gonna talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about maintenance solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maintenance solution like if you're
gonna do one thing applied to your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: do maintenance solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my website, I should have in the next
month or so, I should have my OHN and
[SPEAKER_01]: available again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it there because it takes three
months to make and people hear about
[SPEAKER_01]: natural farming, they wanna get started
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make that available so they don't
have that three month wait time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also gonna have FAA, which takes about a
year to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't offered that in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, these things that are kind of
barriers to entry is part of the reason
[SPEAKER_01]: for offering those on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main solution is FPJ, Oriental
Herbal Nutrient, which is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: prebiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of plant health and then brown
rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that small amount of nutrients applied
weekly can be all you need as far as a
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're applying like a liquid IMO or a
solid IMO and feeding it with some kashi
[SPEAKER_01]: or compost or food scraps and then
applying maintenance solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be your entire growing protocol
right there, like nothing else going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it becomes cathartic, simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spray yourself with maintenance
solution, little in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's this really wonderful natural
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're using one to 500 fermented plant
juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ratios, real quick, I'm gonna jump
into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't ask me, but I talk about ratios
in YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a math problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to a thousand means if you have a
thousand water, what's one one thousandth
[SPEAKER_01]: of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a division problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: One one thousandth is the amount of
nutrient you put in that one thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have a liter, then I put one ml.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one one thousandth of a liter,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm spraying out a liter in my
little liter spray bottle on my two plants
[SPEAKER_01]: or my little garden box, then I need one
ml of OHN.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to five hundred would be two ml's of
FPJ.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one to five hundred vinegar would
be two ml's of vinegar into my one liter
[SPEAKER_01]: spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so little.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're like, how can this like
20 drops of this thing do anything but
[SPEAKER_01]: watch the plants react.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants get shiny and green up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like it's a very easy process once
you just learn the basics and put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: practice yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what advice do you have for those
growers transitioning to KNF?
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the learning journey is and can
be so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, instead of it being the
this, you know, rigorous recipe of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how much pink and green stuff
you're applying and salt fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be this learning journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can affect kind of whole health,
human health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, failure is a good teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid of the failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will just make you better at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try and fail on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're trying something new,
maybe don't try it on everything right off
[SPEAKER_01]: and really take a class.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get the opportunity to come to an
in-person class, it's I've I teach on
[SPEAKER_01]: online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an online class and I believe much
more in an in-person class because taste,
[SPEAKER_01]: touch, smell matters or hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's somebody that's come to a class
that's around you, you know of somebody,
[SPEAKER_01]: go hang out with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Offer to buy them lunch if they'll like do
some natural farming with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that little bit of nuance,
that taste, touch, smell can really help
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of jumpstart your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have up going in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have done some podcasts, obviously
something that I jump onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different places had some of these
conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just searched Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just christrump.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on my website, I do have courses,
online course.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bunch of video time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets so much deeper into all the
details.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am updating that this year with about
double the content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that happens this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been chipping away at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will always be updated,
just added to over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I do in-person classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one in Ireland in June and then I
have one in Cape Cod in October,
[SPEAKER_01]: late September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one in Tennessee in September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of East Coast is getting a lot of
this year as far as in-person classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But come on out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a ton of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community aspect, kind of you taking a
class with people that then you're staying
[SPEAKER_01]: in contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the growing community of natural
farmers is probably the best part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's invaluable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll feel like a vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that's kind of what I'm up to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm on Instagram at SoilSteward and
then Natural Farming Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook page.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the places I hang
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love to answer questions as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just be patient with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I definitely have a link to your
channel down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can head on over there and
check out what he has for content.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just scratched the surface today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did very little when it comes to
natural farming as far as talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could sit here and talk for hours and
hours and hours and go over more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it again sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just about to say that I have a
feeling that the audience is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: demand a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can continue on talking about
some of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can get into ONH.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into deeper into the maintenance
solution, FAA, SES.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot more that we can
certainly talk about in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'd love to have you on in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we get some questions from your
audience from this one and we can answer
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be sure to leave any questions you have
down in the comment section below and
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, thank you so much for coming on to
the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a pleasure and hope you enjoy the
rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a pleasure and good talking
with all you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good night.
