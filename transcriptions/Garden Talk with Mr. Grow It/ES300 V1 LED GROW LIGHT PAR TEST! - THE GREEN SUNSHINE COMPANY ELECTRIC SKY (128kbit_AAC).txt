[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, feed that don't on
me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Groot and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ES300 LED grow light by the
Green Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called the Electric Sky 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to test the PAR
output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the Apple G MQ500 PAR
meter and this meter measures from 389
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers to 692 nanometers plus or minus
5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a heads up, this unit has
about 10% IO which does not show up on
[SPEAKER_00]: this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind that the actual
PAR output is going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher than what the meter shows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just going to give you a
general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is being measured in a Groot tent
which has reflective walls so that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the PAR numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit has a flowering coverage area of
2 foot by 4 foot and the tent I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring it in is 2 foot by 4 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at 18
inches away which is the manufacturer's
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 inches away and then 36 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other PAR test videos
that I have on this channel, I'll let the
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements do the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick note, this is the first
version of this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They now have a V2 or version 2 of this
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ES300 V2 does have different diodes
and a different PAR output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link to this light in the
description section below so you can learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below
and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
