[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 142.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Mr. Gannix.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is an organic gardener, and he grows
his plants in small containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's often said that you can't be
successful growing organically in smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: containers, but he proves otherwise,
and he talks all about it in this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we had a technical issue
with this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recording platform didn't capture his
video properly, so I just have a
[SPEAKER_01]: screenshot for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: The audio is perfectly fine though,
so for all of you listening in on podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms, there's no impact to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk Clips
[SPEAKER_01]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who helped
[SPEAKER_01]: make that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back, and I'm joined with Mr.
Gannix.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit congested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of getting over a sickness here,
so you can hear my voice a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize in advance to those folks that
are listening in, but we're going to power
[SPEAKER_01]: through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a great conversation today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going to be talking all about growing
organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the way that you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a couple of different grow
styles, which we'll get into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, why don't we start off with an
introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Mr. Gannix from HomeGrow the
Community, and I got into growing right
[SPEAKER_00]: around the 2018, Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was the May of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got going for my first round was
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just got the bug right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I got through my very first
season, I couldn't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't wait for the next season to
come along.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did all the research I could possibly
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I started doing my whole
indoor thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you grow both indoor as well as
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got experience in both areas,
which are two different battlefields,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, particularly when it comes to
things like pests, which we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get into here in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a lot of people out there
that are in a situation that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: battling pests and they want to take an
organic approach to elimination.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll definitely get into that here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd like to start off with soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk to us in detail?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your soil mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I start with ProMix as my base,
ProMix HP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to use ProMix because it's
bare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about anything
being too hot or not enough of something
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of pick and choose what you
want to put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use Guy Green as the majority of what
I put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start off with the All Purpose 444
for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll mix everything into the soil
before I fill up the pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to use a three to five gallon
because my setup isn't overly big.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to be able to put as many plants
in there as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll start off with ProMix HP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add All Purpose 444.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use alfalfa meal, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use diatomaceous earth, oyster shell
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use that for like my calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add a little bit of Epsom salt for
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically it that I would add
in at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as time goes on, I'll do a top
dress every couple of weeks, two to three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, depending on what the plants are
looking like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let them kind of tell me what to do
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't see anything going on,
I'll just kind of stick to a schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there's something that I notice,
a yellowing or deficiencies of any kind,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll kind of judge my next round of
nutrients based off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are you using for container
size?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting off with small containers
and then kind of working your way up,
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting it to larger containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just in one container for the
entire growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the time, I like to go straight
from germinated seed straight into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever Home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I don't have to worry about
disturbing any of the roots or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the solo cup thing and like I
have the bud cups as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used them yet, but solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done that, but I really like to just
go straight into the Forever Home.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go into like either a three or a
five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're actually growing entirely
organic in three and five gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is possible, ladies and gentlemen,
there are so many people out there who are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, ah, it's going to be big containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger container, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's often said that you can't be
successful in three to five gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: growing organically, but you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there are some other people
that are doing it a while, Mr. Canucks
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is one of the ones that do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe three gallon containers,
he's doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is possible whether or not it's
more challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that's a debatable thing,
but you could certainly get to harvest in
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller type containers when growing
organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you start off for a soil
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a deer pro mix, guy,
a green four, four, four, alfalfa,
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp, oyster shell, Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some D E in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the nutrients are going to
deplete from the medium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point are you adding in more of
those amendments?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually right in the two to three
week mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started doing it,
I kind of followed the directions and I
[SPEAKER_00]: went every four weeks, but that was a
little bit too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing at the time that things take a
little bit of time to break down is not
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available as soon as you put it in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, you know, you have to kind of give
it that buffer time to break down a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can just stay a little bit ahead
of the game, then really, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't run into a whole lot of problems
for deficiency wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every couple of weeks, two to three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the same amendments that you
mentioned before that you're adding in
[SPEAKER_01]: more four, four, four, alfalfa meal,
kelp meal, oyster shell up some same exact
[SPEAKER_01]: thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for the most part I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do add a little bit in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I use hygrosime as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, um, I use their whole lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll add in their enzyme formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I add in their, uh, hygroben,
which is a microbial blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also the, the high shield,
which is more of a defense kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, it gives the plants, it gets their
defense mechanism going and makes them
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they're being attacked,
which kind of makes them a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: stronger, more resilient, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there, there is a few things and,
and I do, I do add teas as time goes on as
[SPEAKER_00]: well in between and kind of buys me a
little bit of time in between top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressings and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you switching from the four,
four, four to the four, eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: four for bloom at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just sticking with the four,
four, four guy agreeing throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go into, so when I get to flip,
when I'm about to flip, I try to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule everything so that I can do a top
dress about a week before I flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to do like a 50, 50 blend of
the four, four, four and the two,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once my next top dress comes
around, once I'm in full flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it'll all eliminate the four,
four, four altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the, the power bloom after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically again, almost the same
nutrients all the way through switching
[SPEAKER_00]: out the four, four, four and the two,
eight, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're doing a top dressing before
flipping and then about three weeks into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at what the six week mark and
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that you're harvesting,
depending on how long that genetics are
[SPEAKER_01]: due to flower for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: As simple as I possibly can really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that we talked about Mr. Canuck
because I really, honestly, when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: started, I based almost every move I made
in the garden off of what he was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was so simple, because it
worked and he proved it time and time
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, he's been growing that way for so
many years and very successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you look at his plants,
he has some beautiful plants being healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that method has been very,
very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like you kind of put Gaia Green
on the map a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have to agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not many people knew about Gaia Green
until he came around.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the YouTube community became very
familiar with Gaia Green after he came
[SPEAKER_01]: around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about any like sugars or microbial
inoculants?
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of talked about how you inoculate
with microbes, but what about like sugars,
[SPEAKER_01]: any molasses or anything like that that
you use or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use molasses in, when I make my teas,
I'll add molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't normally add molasses just in
between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I always do it when I make my tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Walk us through your tea brewing process,
because that can vary a little bit as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just use compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use worm casting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do a nutrient tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us, what's in your tea brew?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are you brewing and so on and so
forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in veg, I do a couple of different
teas, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a veg tea and I do a flower tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for veg, I'll add my worm casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it in like a little bag,
like a tea bag, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just put it in like a five gallon
bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put my worm castings in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add Alaska fish fertilizer, which is,
I think it's a 5-1-1 mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's readily available nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll add that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add a little bit of hydrazine,
the enzyme formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also add in hydroben.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I sprinkle in a little bit of like
dynamico type of stuff, or great white,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what I have at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I let it brew for 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how long it takes to kind of
hit that froth when it just starts to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of know when it's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you shake a can of pop,
it just comes right over the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 24, 48 hour brew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you taking that solution and
diluting it down in water before giving
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just taking that full
concentration and watering your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do the full concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a problem yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of people that dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cut it in half or they'll add 25%
more water, whatever it is that they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But personally, I've always just given it
the concentrated mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I missed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you brewing it in like a small five
gallon bucket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you in like a larger bucket or
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually like an eight, I think it's
an eight gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a like a wine making bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put about five gallons in there just
to kind of give it that room so I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: boil over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit cleaner for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you doing that like on a weekly
basis or bi-weekly basis or how often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually about every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for sure, when I do my top dressing,
I like to work it out so that I can do my
[SPEAKER_00]: tea at the same time as I do my top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll top dress first and then I'll
water in my tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my head, maybe it's right,
maybe it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my head, it helps break everything
down maybe a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rejuvenating the microbes that are
already in the soil plus adding more
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, adding a little bit of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, it helps break everything down
just a little bit faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus it's readily available nutrients for
your plants right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how about earthworms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using those in your garden at all
or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little worm bin going and I was
doing it indoors and it just got to be too
[SPEAKER_00]: much for the space that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up letting them all go out in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long story short, I guess I don't use
earthworms now, but I do use worm casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still getting the benefit from
them, but I'm not using the actual worms
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, worms can be so beneficial in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using them, red wigglers,
European nightcrawlers, African
[SPEAKER_01]: nightcrawlers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different types that you
can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually wearing the shirt,
Uncle Jim's worm farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where I end up traditionally
buying the worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you buy them once, the population
will multiply really in the containers,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as I have a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing vermicomposting and taking what
I get from there and put it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a fun cycle, you know,
to see all that happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And definitely worms is one of those
things where it's not a requirement when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing organically, but it can
certainly help.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very beneficial for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it does so much like the worm
castings do so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus with the worms being in there,
I think it kind of like helps aerate the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and it just helps keep everything
nice and loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And airy, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they do a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus having a worm bin, like having a
home for your worms, it's pretty cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: watch the process happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Free worms for life, as long as you keep
that bin going, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For real, like it happens so fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when I first got into it,
so being in Canada, I went with a Canadian
[SPEAKER_00]: company and it was winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, I can't ship the worms to you
right now, but I can do the cocoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got some cocoons and it was,
once I did the research, I got the cocoons
[SPEAKER_00]: first and I asked, I can't, it was a
ridiculous number, way more than I
[SPEAKER_00]: probably ever needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I asked for it and he sent them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I did the research, I think it
was like three to six worms or something
[SPEAKER_00]: per cocoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I had like three or 400
cocoons and I, I'm looking at this going,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my God, what did I just do?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it wasn't happening fast enough for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I didn't must, my temperatures must
have been off or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's a specific site you got to
kind of follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I ordered a pound of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the worms came and the next thing
you know, I had like a million worms in
[SPEAKER_00]: this bin and I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, it happens really quickly
when it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned it's slowing down if you
don't have the right temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will slow down like winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, my worm bin is the breakdown
happens a lot slower than in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summertime when it's warm, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually had some pests as well in my
worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes we get pests within the grow
space as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I want to get into
next is talking about pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do to prevent pests in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the number one pest, I think that
any organic grower, will have is a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right off the bat, I tell everybody be
preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right from day one, even if you've never
seen one, just be preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make your own traps out of apple
cider vinegar with a piece of plastic over
[SPEAKER_00]: top, a couple holes poked in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do that every now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hang sticky traps at different
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put them right on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to hang them so that they're
different heights in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sprinkle that onto the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone through a whole different array
of sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the crop defender from Petra
Tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lost Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying one right now from Hygrozyme.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their new Hygro Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be trying that one now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an all-natural, different
essential oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinnamon is one of the things that's in
there, which is another thing you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: for pests and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of try to stay on top of it
right from basically the day that pot goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to just be ready for anything that
can come my way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do run into gnats or something
like that, I've removed the top layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put new soil in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few other things that I've heard
you can do that I've never actually had to
[SPEAKER_00]: get to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like putting sand on the top layer of your
pot so that they can't get in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all kinds of fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure I'm missing some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of the ones that I do
practice now, I'm sure I'm missing some of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are so many different
solutions to gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ones that I use that has been
successful is Mammoth Can Control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an all-natural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That has worked really, really well for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, the amazing Dr. Zymes, another
product that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I don't think has been available
in Canada for too, too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it is now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's been here maybe for about
a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I've kind of already been
fully stocked up on everything else in the
[SPEAKER_00]: meantime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never really got a chance to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mosquito Dunks was another one that I
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use Mosquito Dunks, also Mosquito Bits,
two different products there, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: both Bt type of bacteria that helps within
the medium there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have battled with fungus gnats for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems like whenever I get like
a new bag of soil is kind of when they
[SPEAKER_01]: come back in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll come in with a lot of bagged
soils, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soils, worm casting, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything organic, I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like fungus gnats is one of the
easier pests to battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there been any other pest infestations
that you needed to battle besides fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: gnats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first go at battling something other
than gnats was spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm no longer in that house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened at a previous place that I
lived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But somebody had given me a drying rack
with a bunch of stuff in there and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never even thought about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in, it was in a garbage bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it down in my grow room,
kind of forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day I just started seeing
webs looking around like, what is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything was in flower at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there wasn't a lot I could do with
spraying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I would go in there,
I would clean off everything that I
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly could at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just tried to finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tried to get to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got to the end,
I did a wash, chopped everything down and
[SPEAKER_00]: washed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was sad to see, but I was so
against washing at the time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I felt like I had no other
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was that or throw it in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'm going to try it and see
what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was able to get everything cut down
after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was able to do a full reset,
disinfect everything, go through that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole room, top to bottom with a fine
tooth comb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just sterilize everything I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thrips, battle thrips as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's since I've been in this
address.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work outside and coming home sometimes,
you're excited to get in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people say, change your clothes,
have a shower, do all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really got to watch what you're doing,
especially when you're outside digging and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're in, you know, grass and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring this stuff in with you and you
don't even know it's on your clothes and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thrips is one that I battled last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, they beat me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through, I think every possible
measure that I could find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, it didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up cutting everything down and
shutting down for about a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went through with bleach and
steamer and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw all and everything that you can
think of and just cleaned and scrubbed and
[SPEAKER_00]: steamed and scrubbed and steamed and more
steaming and till I was comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I haven't had an issue since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a tough battle that I'm,
I'm glad you able to salvage at least the
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mite one that you had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had somebody post to my forum years ago
now, and they posted a, I think it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: short video.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they asked him the question,
is my plant ready for harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this beautiful plant, amazing looking
nug, well, top cola really is what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to and like purpling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was ready for harvest, but there
was this massive web on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then spider mites all around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, uh, you know,
you have a spider manifestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so bad because you go all the way
up until harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like all of a sudden you're just
loaded with spider mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always felt that's when the problem
happens though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's never when you can get in there
and spray, at least for me anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was never when I could get in there and
spray things on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always like the last few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, that's, that's when you
don't want to be spraying anything on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's so painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been fortunate enough not to battle
spider mites at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, I mean, yeah, just got to
keep it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I hope you never have to that
and thrips is another thing that you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned it's as far as which one's
harder to battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll leave it up to the folks that
have the experience battle on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that they're pretty much
equally difficult to battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had russet mites is like one of the
hardest things to battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, luckily that's another thing
I haven't come across, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had that one yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different pests that you
got to worry about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And indoors is one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors is another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors is a totally, that's a whole
nother battle rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just outdoors alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pests are no pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, that's, yeah, it's something else
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But focusing on indoors, let's switch it
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for lighting indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple different lights,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both basically the same light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so right now the setup that I have,
I have two, two, three by three tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and in one tent, I have the Mars Hydro
FCE 3000, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the other tent, it's the SF,
SF, no S E 3000.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the, the bar style lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's Mars Hydro, one's Spider Farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty well the same light,
but yeah, it's the 3000s, which I think is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 300 watt light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with both of those models.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're aiming for a certain par during
the different stages of growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: or are you just kind of going by what the
manufacturer suggests in their listing
[SPEAKER_01]: description?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mainly just going by what the manufacturer
suggests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, I haven't really got into the
whole par and VPD and all that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I think that's probably in one of
my next ventures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start kind of testing that and
looking more into, into the lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll probably find out that,
you know, my lighting isn't quite
[SPEAKER_00]: adequate, but I mean, I, I've never
actually had those lights turned up a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent in those tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lights these days are so powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people aren't running on them at
a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm getting away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: With 50, 60% in early flower, you know,
so it's like, I don't think I'm going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be dialing mine up to a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I'm running at 70 or 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So heat is an issue with, with some of
those lights too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like the higher you go,
the hotter, I mean, of course it does the
[SPEAKER_00]: hotter everything gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that, that can be an issue
too, unless you kind of have everything a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent dialed in, which I mines
up and down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I, I just, I'm usually like,
I'm no more than 80%, but usually between
[SPEAKER_00]: like 60, 70% at the end of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the higher those lights go,
the, the more heat that it's admitting and
[SPEAKER_01]: it can certainly be a challenge for your
environment, you know, for your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: if the temperature gets too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you next, what environment
conditions do you aim for the temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I don't, I don't use CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, I haven't gotten down that road
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but so being in Canada again,
I'm going to use, uh, I'm going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: Celsius here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I keep it usually like on the hottest,
it's like 25, 26 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in veg, I like to keep my humidity
like somewhere up around like 60,
[SPEAKER_00]: 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I come down into flower,
I like to drop it down to about 50%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, maybe even a little bit less,
the farther I get into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, which, I mean, I find it harder,
the farther you get into flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher the humidity wants to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I'm battling with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I like to prove,
I like to keep it pretty steady through
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole grow, like 24, 25 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't like to get any higher
than like 26, 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we're kind of, it's getting
pretty warm in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and doing the conversion right now,
it looks like a fair and high,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be 75 to 79 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just figured do that conversion here
for those folks that do Fahrenheit instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty straightforward there when it
comes to temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's get back into kind of the organic
style of growing a couple other things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can do cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do when it comes to cover
crops?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing anything at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I don't do it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I like doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks awesome in your tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I have a lot of times what I do
for my cover crop is I'll add,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, crimson clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I think it's a yellow sweet
clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a red clover and alfalfa,
I think was the other one that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just kind of sprinkle some of that
in there and I'll let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, once it starts getting pretty
high, I'll just kind of do the chop and
[SPEAKER_00]: drop, cut it down and just let it kind of
be on top and they'll just kind of keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just re-amend everything through
that and just kind of like shuffle it in
[SPEAKER_00]: with my fingers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I just kind of like chop and
drop and just let everything go back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right along with that is companion
planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of those cover crops are
considered companion plants, but is there
[SPEAKER_01]: any other plants that you haven't named
off that are companion plants that you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, not, not indoors really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't think I've ever done any
companion plants indoors, but outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put marigolds in with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, they look nice and B, they're another,
another kind of like pest management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they keep some of the animals away,
but they also keep some of the pests away
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, they're, they're one that,
you know, they just basically reseed
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and just keep growing and
growing and growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of marigolds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got them growing outdoors as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the way they look and it's
cool that they repel pests, help prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: those pests from invading grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a nice color into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nice night down, nice and low.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you something to look at up here
and it gives you something to look at down
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Attracts pollinators too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing any type of fruits or
vegetables that require pollination,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know, growing some flowers in
the area can certainly help attract
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, beneficial on several different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about mulch layers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use that mulch layers for
mostly for water retention, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use any sort of mulch layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to cover my top layer with rice
hulls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just put like a thin layer in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I water everything, it just kind
of, just kind of washes it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as I, as my plants are finished,
when I'm, I like, I do reuse my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll break, dump everything into a bin
and kind of remix everything up again,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll, you'll find some of these rice
hulls have made their, their way down
[SPEAKER_00]: quite, quite a ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like a perlite at that point
almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of helps aerate and make it more,
more fluffy and plus they're organic and
[SPEAKER_00]: they break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's some benefit to,
to the rice hulls and the soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think silica I think was one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica is a huge benefit to the plant,
non-essential element.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a ton of different benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, rice hulls is a, is a big one
there and that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you use for a water source and how
do you go about watering your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do use tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use rainwater, but where I am
now, I just, I don't have the space to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So city water, super chlorinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have to let it kind of bubble for
at least 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll fill up a big brook garbage pail
with monster air stones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's six of them on a big
manifold with a pump and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let it bubble for at least 24 hours
before I do my first watering out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll get, I'll get a few waterings out
of that brook container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a, I want to say it's like a,
like a 36 gallon reservoir or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not huge, but it's, it's a good
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll throw my mosquito dunks into that
water as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them just kind of be in there and
bubble with the, with the air stones and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and then I just go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just started actually bottom
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the AC infinity soft watering trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've gone through about half a grow
with, with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, the whole bottom feeding
method is really starting to surprise me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like bottom watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had some struggles though with organics in
particular, like doing the top dressing
[SPEAKER_01]: and then bottom watering and then not
having it really wick all the way to the
[SPEAKER_01]: top and keep that top layer moist where
the amendments were, but having a
[SPEAKER_01]: multilayer or some sort of a cover cup
will help with the retention of the water
[SPEAKER_01]: up at the top there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and every now and then too,
like when I, when I would do a top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing, I would want, I would want to do
a top watering at least for the first time
[SPEAKER_00]: or two, just to kind of get it in there
and help kind of drive it down through the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and let it start breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do, I will add a top watering in the
mix here and there, but I haven't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: done them with organic yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm finishing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished up with a synthetic run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been bottom feeding with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm about to get back into an organic
run with the bottom feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be a first where I do a full
organic run with bottom feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little fun challenge ahead of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be, it'll be one more thing
to just kind of dial in and kind of figure
[SPEAKER_00]: it out as I go, but I think it'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before you did the self watering,
you were doing hand watering, I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: How were you going about determining
whether or not the plant needed water?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would do, I would go in and kind of like
feel the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil was wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, then I know I don't, I don't
really need to, but I would also do the
[SPEAKER_00]: lift, pick the pot up, see how heavy it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, if I, you know, I go to pick it up
and I lift it right up off the ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: then definitely, you know, I've let it go
too long, but I never, with organics and
[SPEAKER_00]: never really let it try to get dry and
never really go for the dry back when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: running organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always try to keep them a little bit
on the heavy side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I just try to never really let
them dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with organics, do you monitor the
pH or the BC or PPM, anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you pretty much hands off when it
comes to all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I catch a lot of flack for this,
but I do, I do pH all my water and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people will always, you know,
again, whether it's right, wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got into the habit of pHing
everything from day one and I've always,
[SPEAKER_00]: even when I had rainwater, I still pHed it
because it would sit out there and it
[SPEAKER_00]: would, you know, it'd be in the sun,
temperature changes the pH, hotter,
[SPEAKER_00]: colder, pH goes up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I do, I do pH and I like to keep
it between like six and 6.5 is kind of my
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I hit anywhere in there,
I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you monitoring the pH of the water
before actually putting it into your soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you monitoring the pH of the soil at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like whether it be a slurry test or a
runoff test, anything like that or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, if I run into problems with
anything, like if, if I started noticing,
[SPEAKER_00]: like there's something going on with my
plants and I, and I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My very first go to, and I tell everybody
this before you dive too deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, don't just start trying a
million things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do yourself a favor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And check your runoff before you do
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's always my first go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I do monitor that,
but it's not, it's not something I do all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only if I run into, run into
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how about EC or PPM to get an
idea of how much nutrition is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I never, honestly, I, I had,
I had an EC pen or whatever monitor,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one when I first started growing,
because I went out and bought everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that YouTube told me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I never really used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never really used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've always been kind of the same
style of growing almost since I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've just never really, never really
needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found window organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people aren't doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be a little bit deceiving because
those amendments that you first top dress
[SPEAKER_01]: in, well, they're not going to show up on
the meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only going to show up once they
they're broken down in a bio available
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was doing hydro or something,
I definitely would be checking that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I steer away from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of one of my, my methods of
keeping it simple, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiss method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, I overcomplicate everything in
life to begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, if I can keep the garden
somewhat simple, I mean, that's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the happy place, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned earlier in the episode
that you recycle your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you walk us through your process?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about recycling your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'll just dump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm done a run, I'll cut everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut it, cut the plant down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a little stock like this left
over or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll go out and I'll dump it into a
big rubber made bin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people like to let their soil
cook and they'll re-amend it right away
[SPEAKER_00]: and let it cook and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, when I'm ready to go, then I'll
take that soil and then I'll refill up my
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and I'll re-amend everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll add a little bit of bio
char in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the other thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll add a little bit of gypsum
in there just to kind of help break
[SPEAKER_00]: everything down and kind of kickstart
everything again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I mean, I just treat
it like I'm starting off with new soil
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get to the end of a run.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants have used up basically
everything that's in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll just, I'll fill my pots up
and re-amend as I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically rinse and repeat almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you letting those new containers with
soil sit for a period of time before
[SPEAKER_01]: planting into them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they call it, a lot of people call it
cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're cooking the soil, letting it cook
for a while, letting those amendments
[SPEAKER_01]: break down before anything is planted into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going straight into it with a new
seed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go straight into it basically with a
new seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was saying, like almost
everything's broken down and used up by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time I tear everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I'll re-amend the soil as I'm
putting it back into the pot again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it needs that like week or two to
kind of break back down again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I put the seed into the soil,
it'll give that week or two to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: break everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time my plant is a couple nodes
tall and needs nutrients again,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the nutrients will be almost ready,
almost right on time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much what I'm doing as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I plant into, I have five
containers that I've been reusing for six
[SPEAKER_01]: runs now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on my sixth run with the same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like there is some nutrition
left over from the previous grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that allows me to plant directly into
it after amending, not waiting for a
[SPEAKER_01]: period of weeks, like some people do,
but other people don't safe side.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll let it wait for a couple of weeks,
let it break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no harm in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, either way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find too with like amendments,
organic amendments, your plant really is
[SPEAKER_00]: only gonna uptake what it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for the most part, like you're really
not going to kill your plants because you
[SPEAKER_00]: amended the soil a little bit too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're doing something that's
super, super high in nitrogen or something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's readily available right this
second, you know, maybe, but adding like
[SPEAKER_00]: the 444 and kind of doing it the way that
I do it with the Guy Green amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never, never run into an issue where
it was too much food for them at the
[SPEAKER_00]: start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I like to ask folks
towards the end of the episode is try to
[SPEAKER_01]: get some advice for beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of beginners that listen
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for them,
for those folks that are just getting
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing organically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Be careful where you get your information
from, cause there's a lot of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a million different ways to grow
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a million different ways to grow
period, but there's so many ways to grow
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take the simple method or you
can go the very, very difficult method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my advice would be find somebody that
doesn't have to be Mr. Canuck,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's who I chose at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick one person and stick with their style
and learn that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overcomplicate everything by trying
to follow five different people at the
[SPEAKER_00]: same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick one person, study what they're
doing, learn what they're doing and just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of follow the steps because there's
people out there that have laid everything
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe go buy yourself a Mr. Grow It book
and go from there because you learn a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are so many different ways to
go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we said a couple of times in this
episode now, and I remember before I
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing organically, I was very
intimidated because of the new method and
[SPEAKER_01]: how there are so many different amendments
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me really just not knowing what ones
to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, kind of narrowing it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many different amendments you can use
in combinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually just go with the blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of organic blends that have
a whole bunch of things mixed into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just apply this blend in veg and
this blend in flour, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: or there's some blends that are kind of an
all in one that you can just apply
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the whole growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, in my opinion, the easiest way
to get into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to mention that one for any
beginners out there not to get intimidated
[SPEAKER_01]: by all the variety of amendments that are
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be overwhelming because there's
so many inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people want to know, can you grow
with just an all purpose four,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, four and a two, eight, four?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's like a multivitamin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's in it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, you definitely can do it
because there's people that do it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: prove it time and time again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we talked about Mr. Canuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're adding your supplements.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us people, when we take a
multivitamin, there's some other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we might need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can dive a little deeper into
it and learn a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh, I want to give it some alfalfa
meal or I want to give it some kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you kind of start learning what
each thing does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can get as complicated as you
want or you can stay as simple as you
[SPEAKER_00]: want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my advice would be to start
off as simple as you can and just learn
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's some really good advice for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they could
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
