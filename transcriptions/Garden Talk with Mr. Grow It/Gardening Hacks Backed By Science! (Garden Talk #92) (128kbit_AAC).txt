[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother plants aren't the same as
production plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a different strategy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen depletes the stored
carbohydrates in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll slow down rooting when you take the
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait until the plants are
suffering, they're turning brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me just add some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to magically bring them
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll come back a little sooner
than they would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really you want to do it before the
stress happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dissected your soil after a grow,
you'll see that there's pockets of roots
[SPEAKER_00]: where the water was flowing and there's
pockets where there's no roots at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the yucca, it would be more even
sponge of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature has all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the answers if you know
where to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can work with nature in an
intelligent way, now you're a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're really doing your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Harley Smith.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been highly requested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many people requested for you to
come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really thankful that you decided to
come on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we're going to talk about a whole
bunch of various topics, tips,
[SPEAKER_01]: and gardening hacks, really techniques
that are going to make things easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: you and save you time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually attended Harley's Master
Growers course a few years back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to have you on here today
so I can pick your brain a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Harley Smith, as you introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm the chief science officer for a
commercial production facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: Total Health Cultivation in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started back in 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost getting close to 30 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back then, I was a video producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making videos on science and
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was hired by a company called
Superior Grower Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they asked me to produce a video
introduction to hydroponics for schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by the time I finished the series,
I knew enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that there's something to this
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really got hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it was a great way to teach the
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that there was a great need for it,
especially here in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're so far behind the rest of
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up getting in as a career,
working with schools, setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics labs all over the United
States, doing professional development
[SPEAKER_00]: workshops for agriculture teachers about
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was showing people how to improve the
nutritional quality of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And improve the plant's natural resistance
to pests and disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got quite the reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I got such the reputation for
knowing the science that I finally got the
[SPEAKER_00]: white jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hired by a fertilizer manufacturer
in Michigan to be their director of
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the beginning of the
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't forget the most important part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along the way, I got my first grow light,
an oscillating fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started growing tomatoes and herbs in
my basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's where the real journey
began.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just doing the research and
interviewing NASA scientists and
[SPEAKER_00]: educators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually hands on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where a little trial and error
made some of those rookie mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe today that we can help the other
growers avoid making the same mistakes
[SPEAKER_00]: that we probably made early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But trial and error turned into trial and
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are still standing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty significant background there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been doing this for a very,
very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know from taking your master growers
course, you know a lot about chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And chemistry really combines with
gardening quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure we're going to get into quite
a bit of chemistry as we go on here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's start with clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about things that can
be done to help clones root?
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe anything else we need to know
about clones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule number one, healthy moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have strong, healthy mother
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And mother plants aren't the same as
production plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a different strategy there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much nitrogen depletes the stored
carbohydrates in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll slow down rooting when you take the
cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first rule, reduce the nitrogen to the
low end of sufficiency for moms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then improve the uptake of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the calcium forms the glue that
glues the cell walls together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a stronger vascular system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant takes up and distributes all of
the essential elements more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all build up into the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take the cutting, separating it
from the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to depend on the stored
carbohydrates and water and nutrients that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in that cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a strong, healthy mom,
lots of stored carbohydrates, they'll root
[SPEAKER_00]: faster and afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another thing you can do, once you
start to get the initial rooting early on,
[SPEAKER_00]: those initial roots coming out,
you can add some kelp extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kelp has auxins and cytokinins that
will stimulate more lateral root growth
[SPEAKER_00]: and more root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first is the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: The material itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can do some things to help
the plant take up nutrients and get a good
[SPEAKER_00]: strong health head start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people are going to cut their
clones at a certain angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, they say that that helps with
rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything to back that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is that just something that maybe
somebody picked up, tried out,
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that it rooted faster,
but may not actually root faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cut it on a 45 degree angle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simply because it gives an oval,
so you get a little more surface area for
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you could cut it straight across and
you'll still get rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's something to it, but it's
relatively insignificant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people that will even scrape
the outer bark a little bit, just to show
[SPEAKER_00]: more of the surface area of that
precambrian layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who has the time to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me as a home grower, I've done that
before where I kind of scraped out the
[SPEAKER_01]: sides a little bit to help with the
rooting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that definitely has worked for me in
the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the mother plant has deficiencies
or it's all stressed out, it's not a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to take clones from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I kind of want to get into
next is stress tolerance of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some things that gardeners can do
to improve plant stress tolerance?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, I think the number one thing is
this is where biostimulants come into
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the nutrients themselves,
but Virginia Tech, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: did a 10 year study on biostimulants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that a combination of five
parts humic acid, humic and fulvic,
[SPEAKER_00]: to two parts kelp, five to two ratio,
worked 50% more effectively than either
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that that
combination did is it stimulated the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: to make 50% more of an enzyme called
superoxide dismutase that protects the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant against stress, heat stress,
salt stress, UV stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant will stay green longer, recover
faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be a key.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the best way to do that is before the
stress, because you're making plant
[SPEAKER_00]: protection agents to protect against the
stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wait until the plants are
suffering, they're turning brown and
[SPEAKER_00]: dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, let me just add some of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to magically bring them
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll come back a little sooner
than they would have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, you want to do it before the
stress happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And should that be applied as like a soil
drench or foliar or either?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If stage zero of cloning is doing a foliar
spray with that same thing, the kelp,
[SPEAKER_00]: the humic or fulvic, I like either one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of prefer fulvic for foliar over
humic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic more for the soil, fulvic more for
hydro or for the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And add a little bit of yucca extracts as
a wetting agent to it, a very small
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, so that the water doesn't beat up
on the surface, spreads out in the film.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two weeks before you take cuttings,
do a light mist with the kelp,
[SPEAKER_00]: fulvic acid, little yucca.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But don't do it any more than once a week
at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once every two or three weeks,
even, will have a noticeable beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will help the plant literally pull
nutrients into those tissues, pull in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sugars and the nutrients so they're
stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: The battery is fully charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can use that at the roots
because then you get more root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a sponge to take up watering
minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take, use it at the surface
on the leaf to pull the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cytokines literally pull the nutrients
into the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to push from the roots,
pull from the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of beneficial trace elements too
you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a healthy mom along the way,
you are going to see a very high
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of rooting and there'll be
shorter period of time than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned yucca and I think a lot of
people are probably watching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of beginner and intermediate
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's some people out there
that haven't even heard of what yucca is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a little bit deeper into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you wrote a article for Maximum
Yield all about yucca.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, what is yucca and what are
the benefits of using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, you can go to the archives and
Maximum Yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do Harley Smith, Maximum Yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll show a lot of my articles.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably read the whole article.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yucca is a desert plant and the roots
can be used to make an extract which has
[SPEAKER_00]: saponins in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of soapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a natural fungicide and natural
wetting agent, both.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants themselves will make saponins
as a plant protection agent against fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It attaches like a steroid, steroid like
attaches to the cell walls of a fungus and
[SPEAKER_00]: it deactivates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plants makes saponins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yucca is rich in saponins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes so it's beneficial as a
wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water will spread out in a thin
film on the leaf when you add that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's more easily and efficiently
absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't beat up into just make
spots on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a fungocidal properties to it
too, even though it's not a fungicide in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although they tested it over in Europe,
they've cut back on copper fungicides in
[SPEAKER_00]: the fields because it's heavy metal and
it's contaminating the groundwater in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were looking for alternatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did one study on apples where they
just used yucca and water only and did the
[SPEAKER_00]: spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just as effective as the chemical
fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's and it's also biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's because it's just a natural
chemical made by plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like it as a as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also if you make that foliar spray
and you spray it and you have some left
[SPEAKER_00]: over, don't put it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll go bad because very biologically
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really want it on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have any left over?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it at the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yucca also will help the water
disperse through the root zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in growing mediums and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the water and the nutrients and the
bio-stimulants get to all the developing
[SPEAKER_00]: root hairs around the edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't just go in and flow through and go
out down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spreads out, disperses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, from my understanding, it can be
very beneficial if you have a soil that's
[SPEAKER_01]: gone hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps, you know, as a wetting agent
helps re-wet that soil or re-moisten that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my question is, is this would this
also be considered a surfactant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a natural surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sort of like soap would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it is a little soapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you'd wanted to do an
experiment, you could take a piece of wax
[SPEAKER_00]: paper and have a drop of water or some
nutrients in one and the one with the
[SPEAKER_00]: yucca in it and just put them side by
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: One will make a little bead up like a
puddle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other will just spread out like a
film.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having it spread out like a film in the
root zone, that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, the water just follows the same
path you did the last time you watered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around the edge or down through and it
builds up some pockets of salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really, if you dissected your soil
after a grow, you'll see that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: pockets of roots where the water was
flowing and there's pockets where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: no roots at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with the yucca, it would be more even
sponge of roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I use, I've been using yucca and I
actually left the bag open and it hardened
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that, is there like a
shelf life on it or can I just like
[SPEAKER_01]: re-crush it up and then put it into water
and mix it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could re-crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very hydroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it attracts the water, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not hydrophobic is the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydroscopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I get a bag of yucca, the first
thing I do is I take it out of the bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: put it in a glass and I can get a really
good seal on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you could probably even put a dust can
in it too if you want to have it last a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once it gets wet, it doesn't go bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just makes it really hard to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're using such a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a sixteenth of a teaspoon for
five gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to, I just do a few
grains of it, put it in and for a quart of
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar spray, shake it up and it'll start
foaming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't take, I can't even measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How small amount that you need to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can scrape a little off of it if
it's hardened up a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrape a little bit and then put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the folks that are using it as a
soil drench, can you overdo it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people are using it every
single time they water their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting a little bit of yucca in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that bad at all or is that perfectly
fine?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that limit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just remember, dilute, dilute,
dilute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a small amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used enough that it did any
harm at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But theoretically, you could do an
overdose of just about anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: including yucca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to us about amino acids and how
they can be useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now, you're getting to the heart of
my R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the year 2000, remember this story
from the class?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the year 2000, the Dutch
government made all synthetic fungicides
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal on food crops because all of those
fungicides had at least the potential for
[SPEAKER_00]: negative side effects on human beings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they said, no, can't use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to protect the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to protect people from the fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overnight, the Netherlands,
cool, overcast, in the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: very susceptible to powdery mildew and
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just naturally, cold and damp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growers started losing a large
proportion, 40% of their crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: to powdery mildew, gray mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they had to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started, they got hold of some of
the bio-stimulant product from Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: That had some promising side effects to
use on plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2001, I was invited to the Netherlands,
to Amsterdam, to visit all of the schools,
[SPEAKER_00]: the agricultural schools over there,
but also to visit the greenhouses that
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing the first trials with that
organic bio-stimulant, ECO-1, highest
[SPEAKER_00]: level of organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to interview the Dutch grower who
was doing the trial for the Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: He went from losing 40% of his crop to
losing zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got a 10% increase in yield over any
past year, and he was first in the line
[SPEAKER_00]: for sugar content in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was growing the best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that particular grower was a
strawberry grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries are very susceptible to
powdery mildew and mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of the torture test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew there was something to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I interviewed the German scientist that
produced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asked him what was in it, he wouldn't tell
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about 10 years of R&D on his
behalf, so he wasn't gonna give away his
[SPEAKER_00]: secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came back, spent four years digging
deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cracked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of the amino acids, glutamic acid and
glycine, literally stimulate root cells to
[SPEAKER_00]: open calcium ion channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of the plant taking in one ion
at a time of calcium and then taking it up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plant, they open the ion channel a
thousand-eye calcium ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tens of thousands flow into the plant and
are taken up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium is the glue that glues the cell
walls together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant takes up more calcium,
and instead of water in the interstitial
[SPEAKER_00]: space, you have calcium pectin,
the glue that glues the cell walls
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a mold spore lands on a leaf,
it doesn't germinate in the surface water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just spray it, wash the spores
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the foot is still in the tissue,
and it comes back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you use the amino acids,
the plant takes up more calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of water in the interstitial
space, by the time that mold spore is able
[SPEAKER_00]: to penetrate the cell walls, to get to the
water in the interstitial space and become
[SPEAKER_00]: established, it dries up and dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it isn't killing fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a fungicide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's improving the plant's natural
resistance to the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops it from getting established and
spreading.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they were able to reduce the
losses to zero, because it never got
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm getting excited about this one,
but not only is there a physical barrier,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the extra calcium that the plant
doesn't use in the cell walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will store it in the vacuole of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stores it up later.
[SPEAKER_00]: If a little bit of powdery mildew or gray
mold gets on a leaf, the plant recognizes
[SPEAKER_00]: the chitin, that's a chemical,
a chitin in the cell wall of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants don't have chitin.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have cellulose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it knows it's under attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant literally sends a signal
molecule from the surface of the cell to
[SPEAKER_00]: the vacuole to open up calcium ion
channels inside the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thousands or millions of calcium ions
go into the cytoplasm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It starts a chain reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant starts a chain reaction,
an oxidative burst, which is the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: first line of defense against the fungus
or even against some insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're building up a natural resistance
in the plants without using any calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use chemical fungicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's revolutionary, really,
when you think about how much we as
[SPEAKER_00]: growers lose to mold and mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that we can do to give the plant
a competitive advantage is worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And amino acids equal one highest level of
organic certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also feed the microbes in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a nitrogen source for
microorganisms to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed healthier soil, healthier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also remember with kelp extracts,
which are very common for gardeners,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have amino acids in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microorganisms in the soil, by the way,
make amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make digestive enzymes called
proteases that break down proteins into
[SPEAKER_00]: the building blocks of proteins,
which are amino acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally, they're making amino acids
right on the surface of the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it without a store,
hydro store, for millions of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just working with nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just giving them a little push in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature has all the answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't anything new.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the answers if you know
where to look.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you can work with nature in an
intelligent way, now you're a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're really doing your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to see it actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let nature do the heavy lifting,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one of the thing about amino acids I
wanted to bring up that I learned in your
[SPEAKER_01]: course was it helps with well water to
prevent limescale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I actually got the final clue
to solve this mystery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have hard water at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's very hard water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could literally, when I add my
phosphoric acid to lower my pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH down, I could literally see
crystals of calcium phosphate forming and
[SPEAKER_00]: falling out of solution like snowflakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how hard it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had limescale clogging out my pumps
and my emitters on the side of my
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even scrape it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But amino acids are what are called
chelators, intermediate chelators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chela means claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they attach to mineral ions like
calcium ions, like a claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: It holds it tightly enough so it doesn't
react.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't lock up in the soil,
but loosely enough so it's released to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant on demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got my amino acid blend to work with
from a vitamin manufacturer out east,
[SPEAKER_00]: experimental product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it in the first thing I noticed,
no more limescale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did it go?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the grow, instead of trying
to scrape all that off, that limescale
[SPEAKER_00]: off, I literally took a paper towel,
wiped a little film of the algae,
[SPEAKER_00]: rinsed it with water from the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did all that calcium go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: The amino acids and the calcium,
there's some relationship there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the final clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did calcium amino acids and it took me
to some studies, latest studies around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world where they're doing patched clamp
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And learning about calcium ion channels,
there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, by the way, when I went back to the
Netherlands a few years later for another
[SPEAKER_00]: tour on biofilters for cleaning water
naturally, but I was over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them about the research I was doing
with the seven primary amino acid
[SPEAKER_00]: chelates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me I knew more about their
product than they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were pumping me for information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the amino acids, they not only
chelate the calcium to keep it more
[SPEAKER_00]: available from locking up, but it also
stimulates the uptake of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants do that naturally with the help
of, especially with the help of
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need, you know, there's a
lot of amino acid products on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people have learned from me
along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the manufacturers are adding
amino acids right to their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just need to know where to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely beneficial information for
those folks that are in hydroponics or
[SPEAKER_01]: even using just a reservoir and have that
lime scale being able to add in the amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids and get rid of that is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get a little bit deeper into
water, particularly kind of chlorine in
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of misinformation out there,
unfortunately, but you know, if there is
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorine in the water, I'd like to know
what harm does chlorine do to the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and what can gardeners do to get rid of
the chlorine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's two different forms of
chlorine in municipal water supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one was more of a chlorine type
gas that's used to kill microorganisms,
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful organisms in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can, at high levels, it can damage
microscopic root hairs because it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's killing the bacteria,
but it's also harming the roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially at high levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chloramine is a more recalcitrant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lasts longer in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the EPA, though, it's not
harmful to plants or to people,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is harmful to fish and
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you want to get rid of both,
you want to get rid of the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to just get rid of chlorine,
you know, that's the only thing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: municipal water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have a side reservoir and let the
water sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chlorine gas will just dissipate into
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a bubbler in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll dissipate a little faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have the chloramines,
they're not going to dissipate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can get an activated charcoal
filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an RO filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an activated charcoal filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some that are designed to
remove the chlorine and the chloramines
[SPEAKER_00]: from the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're hesitant and if you're going
to make compost tea, you want to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want it to kill the beneficial
microorganisms in the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, just an activated charcoal
filter will do the job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are concerned that
are growing in living soil and rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: those microbes in the soil in order to
break down the amendments so the plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're concerned that the chlorine levels
in their tap water is killing off all
[SPEAKER_01]: their microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, on the opposite side, some people
argument towards that is that once it's
[SPEAKER_01]: released from the actual faucet,
the chlorine level isn't going to do harm
[SPEAKER_01]: to the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do harm until it's dissipated
enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we've looked at it under the
microscope where you had some compost tea
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we mixed up another batch that
had the city water and you could just see
[SPEAKER_00]: that they weren't swimming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sluggish.
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbes are sluggish or they just die
with the chlorinated water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it depends on where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, I don't think... I mean,
I've grown plants for years in the city,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the store with city water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once in a while, you'll get a problem
with the water supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a little flooding in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some backup of the sewers and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they'll do is they'll charge it
with high levels of chlorine to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't tell you, oh, you know,
we just added 10 times as much chlorine to
[SPEAKER_00]: your water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that high level, and you know,
it's going to hurt your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll stunt them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they should grow back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used really high levels of hydrogen
peroxide on plants that had root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's stunted them,
but they grew new roots, came back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not one of these, oh, yes or no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to do compost tea,
you should either use spring water or at
[SPEAKER_00]: least let your water sit overnight in a
side reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to let it warm up to room
temperature anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always recommend a side reservoir in
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the day before I do my reservoir
change, I fill up my side garbage can with
[SPEAKER_00]: my tap, with my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day, I pump out my
reservoir, take the pump, put it back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the side reservoir, refill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ready to start a new crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy, fast, and it works well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you wanted to warm up the water a
little quicker, you can put a submersible
[SPEAKER_00]: heater in your side reservoir to let it
warm up more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a huge thing, but I remember when I
first started, I remember doing my
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir changes and bailing out the
water with buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after, you know, man, what a pain it
is to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take them down, dump them in, and get
another bucket, take it down, dump it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How easy is this to put a submersible
pump, a water mover with a hose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a simple water mover that you
can get at Home Depot and have that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: job done in five minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a side reservoir, you can replace
it with room temperature water that's
[SPEAKER_00]: clean and free of chlorine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I live, my city tap water comes in
at 485 ppm, so it's extremely high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even use it because I've tried to
use it on plants before and like they were
[SPEAKER_01]: not happy with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up investing in a RO system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I use RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's some people that have tried
to use a water, they have a water softener
[SPEAKER_01]: and they try to use that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the downsides of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, don't use a water softener unless
you change your salt in your water
[SPEAKER_00]: softener.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a water softener does is it takes the
calcium and magnesium out of the water and
[SPEAKER_00]: replaces it with sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your salt is sodium chloride, but you get
up above 50 parts per million of sodium
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plants aren't going to reach their
genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, if you have a hundred parts,
120 parts per million of calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: replace it with 120 parts per million of
sodium, that's a bad day for your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bypass that on my water softener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I've done this in the winter where
instead of using the regular Morton salt,
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium chloride, there's another type of
Morton salt that's potassium chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more expensive than sodium chloride,
but then you're replacing the calcium and
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium with potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potassium is actually a fertilizer for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the health element.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing something good for your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had to use the water softener,
I would use the potassium chloride salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: RO is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once I learned about how to turn my
lemons into lemonade and get more calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake, I haven't used my RO filter unless
I just want to top off the reservoir with
[SPEAKER_00]: some fresh water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The RO water by itself does have,
has no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pH can swing pretty wildly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, I like to have a
combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to use it, a combination
of tap water and, you know, this room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have some buffer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get deeper into pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the optimal pH range for medicinal
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some ways to buffer the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good pH range, safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.8 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it drift between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't try to get the perfect pH all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I change the reservoir, I typically
shoot for 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growers will shoot for 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either one is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like 6.0 because when I use the pH
test kit, like the GH pH test indicator
[SPEAKER_00]: solution, if it's 6.0, when you're doing
your test, it's dandelion yellow,
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest color to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see if it's perfectly yellow or
just a little yellowish green or just a
[SPEAKER_00]: little yellowish amber, and I can dial it
in pretty simply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just go for 6.0 as being my target.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 5.8 is good too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that for hydroponics as well as
soilless medias as well as soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, you can go a little bit higher in
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go more like 6.5 is a good target,
but it can go up to 6.8 in that area
[SPEAKER_00]: because microorganisms, the closer to
neutral is better for the microbes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's their favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the microorganisms are colonizing
the roots, they are making organic acids
[SPEAKER_00]: that lower the pH right on the surface of
the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be two points lower than the
surrounding bulk soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go a little bit higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with soil, you're going to want to
adjust your pH of your soil before you
[SPEAKER_00]: even start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once your pH of your soil is right,
it's buffered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to change the pH one way or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the pH of the water that you're
watering with isn't as important anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: because the pH is right there where the
plants want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with hydroponics, water is not a
buffer for pH, so it's really easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: change pH of water in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about buffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to add some buffering capacity
to your RO so you don't have the wild
[SPEAKER_00]: swings of spiking and crashing pH,
just add a little, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: add 50-50 tap water to your RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding some buffering capacity,
some calcium carbonate, magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: carbonates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding some beneficial trace
elements that are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spring water has some elements from the
earth with it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you could add a small amount of humic
acid to it if you have that on your shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will add some buffering capacity too.
[SPEAKER_00]: In soilless mix, the humic acid will raise
the pH of acid soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will lower the pH of alkaline soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does have a nice buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of positive and negative
charges on it to hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And release hydrogen ions and hydroxyl
ions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it buffers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your master growers course,
you mentioned that plants will produce
[SPEAKER_01]: 18-20% more essential oils in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about terpenes,
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, is there anything else that
gardeners can do in order to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: essential oil production?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the very first things I
learned in my research on hydroponics for
[SPEAKER_00]: that very first video I did for schools on
introduction to hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a study done, it must have been
in the late 80s, on hydroponics at the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones that discovered,
measured it, that plants grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics had 18-20% more aromatic oils
than field grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they didn't really say why.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know exactly why,
what it was about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing about hydroponics,
all of the essential elements are there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good aeration, perfect water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps the plants reach their
true genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that genetic potential is the
production of the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that may be why.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was just hydroponics alone,
that there was such a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now to increase terpenes, I found,
I did research on my own along the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: and found that healthy stress improves the
terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Healthy stress, it could be, a very common
one to use is drought stress, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do that toward the end, have longer
periods, more dry back between when you
[SPEAKER_00]: waterings, and the plant will respond to
that and make terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other way is salt stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I love to do in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's easy to just raise your EC,
the electrical conductivity, so it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit salty, makes it a little harder
for the plant to take up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a response, they make
antioxidants to protect themselves against
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those are flavonoids and other
molecules and terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did do one experiment to prove that,
because I kind of knew that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was taught that early on in my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mixed up some hydroponic nutrients,
three different strengths.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was half strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was full strength, according to the
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was high strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did side by side in the same
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants with the highest strength,
the highest EC, had the darkest colors,
[SPEAKER_00]: the richest aromas, strongest flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't like, oh, yeah, I think this
is a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was a dramatic difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The three jars, side by side, you could
see the different color intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open up the jar and take a sniff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could smell the terpene profile just
in your face.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd get the highest prices,
because it was the highest amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamins and the highest amount of the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so that really helped when I was
trying to be more competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If with tomatoes, I could do the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could raise my EC up even higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get 50% more of the lycopene
content, the red pigment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's red all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could get 30% more of vitamin C content
just by raising the EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, some of those vitamins that
are manufactured are a stress response
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to baby them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give them some help.
[SPEAKER_00]: But too much stress, they can't take up
enough water to meet their needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they start getting crispy on the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get your fertilizer burned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a negative effect on the growth
and productivity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to be a great gardener,
learn how to manage stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Manage the stress of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go a little too high, the leaves
start to curl at the ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then just back off on the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they start to curl and turn brown
on the edge, you know you've gone too far.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to write a note.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best growers are the best record
keepers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not go past this EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the top line for that particular
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just live close to that line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your plants will thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know a lot of people doing
precision stress methods in order to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to increase the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I hear it from so many different
people that it works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just me in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wind stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the plants that are right next
to the fan that's blowing somewhat harshly
[SPEAKER_01]: against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see a clear difference in tricone
production on those plants versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that were further away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wind stress is a thing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you talked about the other ways
that you can stress the plant in a
[SPEAKER_01]: precision method in order to increase
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just remember at the end, you don't want
to get too much heat stress at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when they're going into the lights,
because that will evaporate the terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll lose some.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to at the end kind of
cool it down a little bit to preserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also that could lead to fox tailing,
right, which is the characteristic that
[SPEAKER_01]: some people actually like.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people find it undesirable,
you know, in their final flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, increased heat can definitely do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My theory on the fox tailing is the
combination of the heat and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phosphorus toxicity shows up as a zinc
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And zinc is critical for making the growth
hormones, the auxins, IAA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you get too much phosphorus and too
much heat in combination, then it affects
[SPEAKER_00]: the hormonal balance of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of the flower buds filling in,
they want to just do more cell division
[SPEAKER_00]: and fox tail out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see it if they're further away
from the lights, you don't see it as much
[SPEAKER_00]: of fox tailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, phosphorus is temperature dependent
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have cooler temperatures,
it doesn't take up as much phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have high temperatures,
and high phosphorus, then it's taking up
[SPEAKER_00]: more phosphorus too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can build up the toxic levels
in the tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't heard that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about increasing terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to kind of flip it over to
increasing yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: A common way to do it, very common,
is CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the benefits of
supplementing CO2, and what CO2 level is
[SPEAKER_01]: ideal?
OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, light is the limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get the best quality light
you can to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a whole other story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting ready to start some lighting
trials in a facility we just built using
[SPEAKER_00]: inter-lighting and also sub-canopy
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But light is number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once light is no longer the limiting
factor, then CO2 becomes the limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a closed room, and the plant
uses up CO2, takes in the carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: for photosynthesis under those lights,
they can deplete the CO2 in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they deplete it down to, say,
200 parts per million, the plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a deficiency of CO2 is actually worse
than the beneficial effects of increased
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the very least, you want fresh air
coming in to replace the depleted CO2 in
[SPEAKER_00]: your room at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the other hand, if you increase
the CO2 in the atmosphere to, say,
[SPEAKER_00]: between 750 and 1,500 ppm, you could see a
50% increase, 30% to 50% increase in yield
[SPEAKER_00]: easily if you have a good light and air
movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, but you don't need CO2 at night,
only during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to go too high either.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get up above 1,500, you're wasting
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants will start to close the
stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, here's a little tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned this along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to ramp up your CO2 as well
when you're going from veg to bloom and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're under heavier production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to just go from 400 ppm to
1,200 overnight, because the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: have to adapt to that high CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll close the stomata until it has a
chance to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ramp it up slowly, the plants
will adapt better, and they'll respond
[SPEAKER_00]: better to the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if they close their stomata,
then they're not transpiring as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not taking up nutrients as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even get a nutrient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same way, if you have excess, you get,
say, 5,000 parts per million of CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll close up the stomata so much that it
can burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll look like fertilizer burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edge of the leaves will actually turn
brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get up to 10,000 or higher,
it's not even good to be in the room for
[SPEAKER_00]: an extended period of time as a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's OSHA standards there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But between, I think, 1,200 ppm is a good
goal, a nice target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in Arizona, in the tomato production,
hydroponic tomato production, with all
[SPEAKER_00]: that light, a cloudless day in the summer,
high light intensity, they'll go up as
[SPEAKER_00]: high as 2,000 ppm during the peak of the
day, because the plant can use it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I saw that they actually have light
sensors in the greenhouses that measure
[SPEAKER_00]: the accumulated sunlight for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the computer will adjust the CO2 for
the prevailing conditions, the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing they do commercially is they
need to have heating at night because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: cold in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during the day, they're using the
boiler and they're producing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they pump the hot water into
storage tanks, insulated tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: At night, they run that hot water through
the pipes in the greenhouse to warm the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone and warm the canopy at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're getting double duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 during the day when they need it,
heat at night when they need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very automated as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one other thing I want to get
into, which I think the audience will gain
[SPEAKER_01]: value from, which is bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you had mentioned that 12% or higher
bricks, pests won't recognize the plant as
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know there's a lot of people
listening in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They battle grow after grow after grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spraying their plants to prevent
pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're spraying their plants when they
have pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not even looking at bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about bricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is bricks?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you measure it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you increase bricks?
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic gardeners know a lot about
bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been using it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, remember, this bottom line is a
measurement of the sugar content in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also kind of measures the total
dissolved solids as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic elements don't conduct electricity
like sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't use an EC meter like you
would for measuring your salts for your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just won't register on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the more total dissolved solids and
sugar and water, the more it reflects
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a refractometer is how you measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a few drops of sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the leaf, first fully developed leaf
near the top of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You squeeze out of two or three drops of
sap onto a slide of this refractometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can, because it's bending the
light, you can actually read it like a
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer what the bricks level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal, for me anyway, is 12% or
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: For very healthy, it's measuring the,
indicating the current nutritional status
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to increase it, first thing I do,
if I go into a, as a consultant,
[SPEAKER_00]: go into a room or into a greenhouse,
first thing I'll do is a bricks test.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the bricks is too low, I'm going to
adjust potassium to nitrate ratio in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the very first thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either reduce the nitrogen, increase the
potassium, or do a little of both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, if you overdo it with
nitrates, which most growers do,
[SPEAKER_00]: they think, oh, I need the yields,
give it more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the plant will, it's a luxury
element.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's going to take up nitrate and
nitrogen, whether it needs it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes a lot of energy away from
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 30% of the energy of the plant goes
into assimilating the nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you give it more and more nitrates,
it'll take it in, but the bricks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the storage sugars go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also with too much nitrogen,
you get big cells with thin cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy meal for insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very easy for fungus to get attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the number one thing to increase grips,
bricks, is not to over fertilize,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cut back to the lower end of the
sufficiency range of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do leaf analysis too, in my
facility, and check out what the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been continually, I've been
cutting back even what I thought was a
[SPEAKER_00]: good number.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm realizing the plants don't need that
much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can cut it back, the bricks goes
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potassium on the other end,
potassium is the health element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps in carbohydrate metabolism to
manufacture the sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also it helps in loading the sugars into
the sap.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it helps to activate enzymes that
will convert the storage sugars,
[SPEAKER_00]: the starches, into sugars that can flow to
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And be stored in the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to raise that, but lower my
nitrogen until I find that sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon the pun, the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can go beyond, if you want to go
beyond that, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve the uptake of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the kelp, humic acid, you get more
lateral root growth, more root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a sponge of roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take up more water and
minerals, give more chemical reactions,
[SPEAKER_00]: higher bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots, we can do it with the foliar at
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can, of course, first just make
sure we have a balanced nutrient for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bricks goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trace elements are important for that too,
because it stimulates metabolism at the
[SPEAKER_00]: root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stimulates the metabolism of
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some microorganisms that
literally make volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tell, that turn off the sugar signal
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So later in the, in toward harvest,
the plant doesn't know it has enough
[SPEAKER_00]: stored carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it continues to do photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Continues to make sugars all the way to
the day of harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can stimulate some of the
microbes, like bacillus, subtilis,
[SPEAKER_00]: GVO3, maybe add some molasses toward the
end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molasses won't go into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll feed the microbes and the microbes
will tell the plant, make more sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last part of that is iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is one of the limiting factors in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets oxidized, turns into rust really
easily, and then it becomes unavailable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But iron is a co-factor in the production
of chlorophyll, the pigment that absorbs
[SPEAKER_00]: the light and makes the sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get good iron uptake,
trace elements, then that again is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to contribute to your bricks in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron, copper, manganese are the big ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more thing, remember CO2, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: At ambient CO2, rubisco, that's the enzyme
in photosynthesis that actually
[SPEAKER_00]: assimilates the carbon dioxide,
changes into organic carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the limiting factor under ambient
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing at high CO2,
then rubisco is no longer the limiting
[SPEAKER_00]: factor because there's extra carbon
dioxide for the plant to take in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that case, the electron transport
chain becomes the limiting factor and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where those trace elements
availability are going to really shine for
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing your bricks at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bricks can definitely be beneficial for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole episode has just been
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my audience is going to get a lot
of value from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are coming up towards the end here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I want to give you the
opportunity is to tell the listeners,
[SPEAKER_01]: how can they find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you have anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not real easy to find me these days
because I'm not teaching my classes this
[SPEAKER_00]: year, the one you did, the master growers
short course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am going to restart that and I'm
going to add new material because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been working in the commercial facilities
for the last few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some things to add that I didn't
do in the short course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I guess the easiest way
would just be to email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me an email and say, hey,
one of your classes is starting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to keep track of that and let you
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my email is Harley, H-A-R-L-E-Y,
like the motorcycle, dot P as in Peter,
[SPEAKER_00]: H as in hotel, T as in Tom, Harley dot
P-H-T at Gmail dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just send me and just drop me an email
and we can keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like getting phone calls and texts
because I work full time and it interrupts
[SPEAKER_00]: me too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an email, I check them in every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as long as I'm not too
exhausted after a 12 hour day,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be happy to respond or at least let
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you on social media at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like do you have a YouTube channel or
Instagram or anything like that or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have my own channel, but if you
Google Harley Smith YouTube, you'll find a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of free workshops on there in
lectures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good place to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even have some that are just 60 second
long, little clip-its that are pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: popular on different subjects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So start there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have an Instagram and my tag is
Harley 500 for Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I start doing classes again,
I'll call you because I'm really going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need to learn how to do social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm coming to the 21st century for a
little while here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the word out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely willing to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to something
to your channel or to your Instagram or
[SPEAKER_01]: something down in the YouTube description
section below so folks can easily access
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks, if you enjoyed this episode,
click that thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single weekend, I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode and I'd love
[SPEAKER_01]: for you to tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harley, thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool that I was able to go
through your master growers course and
[SPEAKER_01]: then be able to pick your brain further
because I definitely learned a few things
[SPEAKER_01]: in this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I mentioned earlier in the
episode, I think my audience is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get a lot of value from this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
