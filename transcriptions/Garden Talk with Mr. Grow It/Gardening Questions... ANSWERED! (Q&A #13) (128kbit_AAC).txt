[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a soil recipe you prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long you've been tuned
into my channels, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that I use a lot of Fox Farm
Ocean Forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because it's convenient,
local at my nursery, so I'll pick that up,
[SPEAKER_00]: use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use that from seed all the way to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, adding in amendments sometimes
as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have added in some alfalfa and insect
frass into my Ocean Forest before and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got a really good result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely recommend trying that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people would be like,
oh, that's way too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up the benefits of insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look up the benefits of alfalfa meal and
realize that neither of those things are
[SPEAKER_00]: in Fox Farm Ocean Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some really good results with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as mixing my own soils,
honestly, I've just been using the bagged
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and then reusing that bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I'll mend it before I start
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mend it with Build a Soil Craft
Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every 30 days, I'll do a cup of
Build a Soil Craft Blend per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the easy organic way to
go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you slightly change pH in bloom to
uptake the bloom newts better or stay
[SPEAKER_00]: around the same for the whole grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of debate behind this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will keep it the same
throughout the entire grow, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: in soil 6.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have healthy plants throughout
the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some will drop it lower than that 6.0,
even as low as 5.5 in soil, believe it or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, which is something that you don't
hear about much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely have healthy plants at
those pH ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as you know, should you increase
the pH in bloom so it can uptake certain
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the pH chart for nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just Google that, find it online,
and you can see the higher the pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less availability for some of these
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that one in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know if your meter is set to a
500 or 700 scale?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to contact the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the manufacturer is going to be the one
to tell you whether or not your meter is a
[SPEAKER_00]: 500 scale or 700 scale meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did was I went to the actual Amazon
listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll see it asked as a
question, or it'll be an actual listing
[SPEAKER_00]: description, whether it's a 500 or a 700
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can ask a question, or again,
reach out directly to the manufacturer to
[SPEAKER_00]: find out if the one you're using is a 500
or a 700 scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a good PPFD for flower with no CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like going any higher than 900.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anytime I'm over 900 PPFD, I'm talking
about 900 PPFD at the canopy there,
[SPEAKER_00]: with no CO2 supplementation, every time I
go over 900, I can start to see some leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: burn symptoms, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like just the plant,
reading the plant and seeing when the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something you get with
experience, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see, especially when you blast it
with so much light and it comes to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's a little bit droopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes I'm just doing 800 PPFD with no
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a mother plant in cocoa growing
with synthetics, is it really bad to clone
[SPEAKER_00]: it into a happy frog and transplant it
into a living soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just understand the plant has nutrient
requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're giving the same nutrient
requirements in the living soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been in the impression the
clone should be the same medium and
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients as the mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear people say that, but look at
the science behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that there are 17 essential
elements for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're given those elements as needed
at the proper balance, if you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: excess of some elements in the medium,
it can inhibit the uptake of other
[SPEAKER_00]: elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to have that proper balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have a proper balance,
of nutrients and the nutrients that it
[SPEAKER_00]: needs within the medium, the plant should
be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you empty it into a large container and
then mix soil to reset?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't been doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been top dressing in and
sometimes I'll dig up and disturb the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit, but a lot of people's goal
is no till, no till living soil is just
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to add in amendments up top,
for example, and then not have to disturb,
[SPEAKER_00]: do minimal disturbance of the microbial
life in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing the disturbing and
removing the root ball, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as I like the stock and part of
the root ball, removing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's a little area, there's a
little hole there, which I can work with
[SPEAKER_00]: digging down a little bit more,
mixing in that couple of amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: backfilling with soil and then planting my
plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been working out pretty good
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't had to remove the soil from
that seven gallon container, mix
[SPEAKER_00]: everything up nice, and then add it back
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use bolt-hermers or do you do it by
hand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I do it by hand, but I'm
interested in using the bolt-hermers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asinfinity has two different sizes of
bolt-hermers, so I'm gonna have to get my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands on one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you thought about trying grow dots as
an experiment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things obviously would be cool to see some
bigger channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked some up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did pick some up, so I hope to try it on
a future grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure when I'm gonna be able to try
it, but yeah, I have my hands on it right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll be trying it at some point in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have experience with the auto pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done several grows with the auto
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried it with both synthetic
nutrients in the reservoir, and I've also
[SPEAKER_00]: tried it with organics and had some mixed
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like the concept of auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know, it's basically
a bottom-fed system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll feed down to basically a tray that
the grow pot is located within.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll fill with water, and then it will
wick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using it with organics, had some
success with it, mixed success when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: top dressing with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing top dressing with
organics, I wouldn't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have done it, and they get
away with it, and they argue against my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in my experience, I haven't had good
success with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is because with this bottom
wick system, it's gonna wick all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that top layer where your amendments
are, it doesn't really get the moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: level that it needs, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've tried having cover crops on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried having mulch layers on top
where they keep that top layer moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still felt like I've struggled top
dressing organics in the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people have gotten other results,
so feel free to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the synthetics, great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a third dose, quarter dose of
nutrients, so less nutrients, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly being fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got some really, really good
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I put just CalMag in the
reservoir and ran it in there and got some
[SPEAKER_00]: good results for when I just needed to
supplement calcium magnesium at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that the liquid nutrients that
they're using isn't too thick,
[SPEAKER_00]: could potentially clog up the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're using the copper disc
that comes with the auto pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it can be either in the pot and
then the soil, or it can actually be below
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot in the tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't use the copper disc,
basically the roots will come all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through the bottom of the system and clog
up the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely use a copper disc.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, definitely got some good results
off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they came out with a larger auto
pot now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as container size, I believe the
auto pot XL is just under four gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have larger pots now in a
different system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would probably go towards the larger
pot in the future if I were to use them
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I've used them several times in
the past and got some pretty good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just might be a little bit more difficult
kind of working the amendments down
[SPEAKER_00]: through the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to do it, to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teas, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do teas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help boost the microbe
population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what you put in the tea,
if you put some amendments in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are going to be water
soluble, some of them aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them will turn out to be
bioavailable fast acting, the plant can
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake it immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, you might have to put that bag
with whatever you have in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, worm casting amendments,
use that as a top dressing after you brew
[SPEAKER_00]: the tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people do that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, long story short, you can top dress
with cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not as easy as if you didn't
have the cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to try AC Infini's auto
watering system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just saw Rob's video on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So big shout out to Rob from CLTV.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a video detailing how that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, interesting way that
that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely the only system that works like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did send me over one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think I'm going to try that out
next grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it could make things a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your cat's name?
[SPEAKER_00]: My cat's name is Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys see him floating around?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there he is.
[SPEAKER_00]: He usually comes onto the lap,
but sometimes he's like, no, I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be on your lap.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just wants to rub up against me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think adding aloe is worth it as
what as a rooting hormone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, a lot of people do use that for when
you're trying to get cuts to root.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, try out aloe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have an aloe plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had it indoors, moved it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's actually struggling with the heat
outdoors, but it's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can harvest aloe right off
the plant and use it as a rooting hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's tons of videos online showing
that I like the one by Green Goblin 510.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you search YouTube Green Goblin 510
aloe, his video should pop up and he gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you details step by step on how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a ton of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't recommend that video enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be the best bang for my buck as
far as meters go that read temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the AC Infinity inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I just stick with that what they
have now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently use the sensor push monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it since like 2017,
I believe maybe even 2016 way back when it
[SPEAKER_00]: first came out and I've had great results
using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a monitor you can hang down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's only I think inch and a half
by inch and a half size, very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can easily hook it up to your rope
ratchet, hang it down canopy level and it
[SPEAKER_00]: connects to my smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has its own dedicated app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get alerts if my temperature
humidity goes out of range and that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using for many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the pulse monitor in the past
larger than the sensor push.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some more features in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newer ones you can actually par.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a par meter attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity controller 69 Wi-Fi edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not released yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about to start to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from my understanding, it'll be
similar to the sensor push where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get alerts on your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can do that right now with the
controller 69.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been using the controller 69
just yet, but I believe it'll be set up
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll be able to do your AC Infinity
inline fan, your light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AC Infinity light can be connected to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oscillating fans from AC Infinity can
be connected to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control all that with the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's what I'm leaning towards
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I need to set up that controller
69, get that thing going, the Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_00]: edition and start to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can give you a more detailed
answer whether or not I recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patiently waiting for your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just picked up the teaming series with
Lohenfeld's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I mean, if you're a beginner,
you'll get some value out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to reiterate, my book is just
specifically for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you everywhere from getting the
equipment, seeds, and going out through
[SPEAKER_00]: from seed all the way through curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a section in there for
like the top 12 plant problems and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you can do about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's written for the bare bones beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some people that bought it and
they had experience and they're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why is there such basic information?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, it's a beginner book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you're a beginner to help you
on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have some experience,
just keep in mind, it's a book for
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners teaming series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So teaming with microbes is something that
I'm rereading right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they actually have an audio version of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the audio book, I like listening to
that every now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider that more of an advanced book.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of good information in
there, but it gets very deep into soul
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be patient if you are a beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intermediate, I mean, geez, you could even
be an advanced person and get confused by
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things or some of the things
may go over your head, but a lot of great
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to Jeff Lowenfeld.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I can get him on the podcast
sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
Thank you.
