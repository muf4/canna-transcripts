[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grebbit
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're watching My Extras Channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got an unboxing and a short
walkthrough for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Gove Wireless Thermometer and
Hygrometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is actually Wi-Fi enabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a different model that is
Bluetooth enabled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically this unit not only tells you
what the temperature and humidity is when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're standing next to the unit,
but it also includes an application that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can download on your phone and you'll
be able to see what the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is through the app as well as set
up alerts and we're going to walk through
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little bit later on in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: First let's start with the unboxing of the
unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, very nicely
packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this separate box right here there are
a few pieces to where you can assemble
[SPEAKER_00]: into a stand or you can use one of the
pieces as a wall mount and I'll show you
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do that in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This card right here has a little bit of
additional information.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives an email for support so if you
need any support you can email them and it
[SPEAKER_00]: shows what their social media is as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly is the user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so my cat Stella has decided to join
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's pretty interested in this as well
and in order to get it to function you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just pull out this tab in the
back and then as you can see the unit has
[SPEAKER_00]: turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'll remove the clear plastic film and
the unit is now operational.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can now see both the temperature and
the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so I'm going to quickly unbox one
more of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sent me over four units.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have multiple grow areas so
I'll be using this device in four
[SPEAKER_00]: different areas actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on this one I'm going to actually
place it into the stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see here I'm assembling the
stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just simply slides in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: For now I'll place this one on the floor
of my grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what I'll do is I'll take a
canopy temperature reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my sensor push hung at the canopy
level right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I may eventually switch it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other device I am going to mount it
to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I only need one of the pieces out of
that separate box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the piece that the unit actually slides
into is what I'll be using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll take the 3M double-sided
tape that is provided in the box as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will stick it to the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay now we'll go into the app and we will
do a quick walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of course you've got to get the
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is available on both iPhone as well as
Android.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just downloaded the app and I now
have it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just clicked the top right corner to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that they have several
different pieces that are compatible with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just thermometers, hygrometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can connect LED strip lights,
copper wire lights, LED bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got other lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also additional smart home accessories
such as they do have like a smart plug,
[SPEAKER_00]: water leak detectors, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the app is asking me to sign in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually need to sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first time I've ever used
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so after signing in I am going to add
in the two devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I simply find the device on the list
and click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's going to actually show which
devices are nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can detect the units that are on and
you can simply click them to activate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's asking to hold down the button on
the device for three seconds to sync it
[SPEAKER_00]: all together, which I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see once it's synced it
actually blinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives the opportunity to name the
device and then you click done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm adding the second device doing the
same thing where I just basically find the
[SPEAKER_00]: device on the list, hold down the button
on the unit for three seconds,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it all syncs together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so in the app it is going to show
the temperature and humidity as you can
[SPEAKER_00]: see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually one of the devices actually
selected at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can change this from Fahrenheit to
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also look at the data in different
ways whether it be look at it for the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it for the week, month,
or year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I obviously don't have any data yet since
I just activated the device so it'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: time for that to accrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the main menu you can see
both the devices are visible there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then browsing around to some of the
different menu options here is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can add more devices like I talked about a
little while ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's some more things, miscellaneous
things in regards to their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here there are different profile
options that you can change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's click back into one of the devices
and let's set the temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here I'm setting the
temperature range first in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: activate it you need to slide over the
alarm me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we go back into the main
menu you can see that it does actually
[SPEAKER_00]: show what the range is right there on the
home screen which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again a link to this product will be in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to do a quick walkthrough
today to show you guys what it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of this unit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below
and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace!
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
