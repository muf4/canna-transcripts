[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know that plant roots can like
hear water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, plants have a memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every color penetrates and gets captured
by the plant differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get more sites that can get more
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting more photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The leaves are getting bigger,
capturing more, and you're getting more
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes hitting to where there is light.
[SPEAKER_01]: His studies show that infrared,
in the presence of other colors,
[SPEAKER_01]: does cause photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like DLI or Indoor just
because it's so hard to calculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we're trying to do as humans
is pinpoint one thing about the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: just say we know what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really there's every color is
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different systems in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different receptors, all sorts of
things going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Growett, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 58.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Dan from the
Green Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets deep into lighting science in this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about photoreceptors,
DLI, PAR, EPAR, BPAR, UV, IR, and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening, all plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make the goal possible.

[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their Cloudline T6 and T4
inline fans for several years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I absolutely love the automation built
into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the inline fans controller,
you can have set points for high and low
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, as well as high and low
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This greatly helps control my indoor
garden environment, so the temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity stays in the ideal ranges.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Dan from the Green
Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an action packed episode for you
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk all about lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some lighting experts or lighting
enthusiasts on my channel in the past and
[SPEAKER_00]: really got some great information from
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is definitely going to have some
new information as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you may know Dan from the Green
Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running his lights since they
first came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 2018, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running the ES300 and also the
ES180.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had multiple versions of those
lights, which I'm sure we'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have V1, V2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's on the V3 version.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, awesome light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also may know him from a
couple videos we did together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, it was probably about a
year ago now, we did an episode on just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quick video talking about security
cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: They emit IR light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the big question was, is that impact
plant growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one actually did really well for
21,000 views on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the one before that was at
MJBizCon where we did kind of a sit down
[SPEAKER_00]: there and we talked about lighting and
different spectrum and how it impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growth and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got over 193,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one really popped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're pretty famous about those two
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure there's quite a few people who
know you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's get into, for those that don't
know who you are, how about an
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, my name is Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I founded the Green Sunshine Company in my
living room in the basement five or six
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't really intend to get into
lighting or nutrients or anything that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're into now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I just kind of knew I liked
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started with my grandfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: He always had a tomato garden in his
backyard, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was feeding me juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you guys ever had
vegetable juice, but he was always like,
[SPEAKER_01]: here, Daniel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called me Daniel when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrot juice or celery juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's carried with me for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a good imprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my grandma actually was like an
apple expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my grandma computer expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got this technical and gardening
thing that fused together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, I didn't garden myself for a
while until I was living in a tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was hanging out at a bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this story is kind of how I got
started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm talking with this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he invites me up to his apartment to
see his garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just like, OK, I didn't know anyone
in the town.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know, I'd just go see
whatever this guy's garden is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm fully expecting to see something
illegal at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legitimately, he just showed me his
balcony nighttime garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had peppers, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he had what else?
[SPEAKER_01]: He had like a, I forget what you call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that fruit where you eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like it goes, like your mouth can only
taste sweet instead of sour.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is like that there is a special
fruit that does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, he had that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of opened my eyes to the
fact like, oh, like you can garden on your
[SPEAKER_01]: balcony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried it with some peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't work out too good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started reading a square foot gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I went to Oregon, I had some yard
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to unsuccessfully grow
outdoors for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, I got pretty good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been doing that for like maybe a
decade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been kind of poking around with
outdoor gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went indoors about I don't know
the number of years, maybe six or seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Became legal in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I needed to grow for my family.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of when I started doing
the indoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my little technical mind got into
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way back in the day, if you look at the
Wikipedia article for photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually was angry because everyone was
saying that red and blue light was the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing that plants used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, no, they use green.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've seen the plant studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it works, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like way back in the day, we finally
got over the red and blue pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then recently we were getting over the
infrared bump.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically how I started with
the electric sky is I found what I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: was the best spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use custom diodes that creates a smooth
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of how I started in my
gardening career.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went on to, we made earth
dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our other product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it, start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with my grandfather.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some random guy in a tropical
state showed me his balcony garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started growing outdoors,
indoors, and then now here we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned to begin is, you know,
we've known each other since 2018,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is when we first met.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017, I think it was at MJViscom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was like one of those
things like you see like a famous person
[SPEAKER_01]: because you see in my video, like,
Hey, I know you, you know, and then like,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, so it was one of those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, it was fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're the famous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a YouTube channel now,
which I actually link it down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the green sunshine company,
tell us a little bit about what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have on the channel?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there, there's a ton of
information on lighting and also how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a, just did a how to grow series
from start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we did two live broadcasts or a few
live broadcasts where we did live Q and A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got one with earth dust and then
one that's broken up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not about us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit electric sky brings you
through the entire process of growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: release how we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so if you're just looking for a guide
of where to begin, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using our products, you can use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, we have a bunch of ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like on earth dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause really like the, I recently got
really into the science of growing in soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, we were not talking about that
today, but, you know, we could talk a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: about, you know, bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fungi and the mycorrhizal forms and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, but today is about lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and actually I should be covering a
lot in this interview that I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: really covered, uh, in any of my other
videos before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lend it all out on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some exclusive material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm going to ask you a very basic
question, but I'm sure it's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a very complex answer, which is how do
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interact with light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a question, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, before I answer that question,
did you know that plant roots can like
[SPEAKER_01]: hear water, you know, they'll like go
towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can like hear they've done studies
about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also plants, uh, have like a memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do like they, they will remember like
sounds and air movements and react in
[SPEAKER_01]: certain ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're way smarter than you think,
probably smarter than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're probably so smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So light is just something totally
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, it's amazing because,
you know, we can measure light sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we can, uh, take the light and put it
on top of the plant side of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: change the color, change the intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's, it's kind of like our way of
really interacting with how the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, really this, this started to
accelerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: When LEDs came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause finally, you know, instead of taking
like, you know, old stage lighting gels
[SPEAKER_01]: and like changing the color that way,
you know, we can, we can identify,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, LED wavelengths, you know,
and that's actually right around when LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: came out, they can only make red and blue,
uh, that correlated with, uh, one of our
[SPEAKER_01]: plant studies that, uh, recognizes what
chlorophyll absorbs, just absorbs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is red and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're like, Hey, LEDs make red and
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a chlorophyll graph and look,
bam, they can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore plants only use red and blue
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's where purple LED lights came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're wondering how on earth do we
got all these purple LED, LED grill lights
[SPEAKER_01]: with a combination of technology,
limited understanding at the time of being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to really adjust that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, when I started, you know,
as you mentioned, as I mentioned before,
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the photosynthetically active
radiation guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wikipedia, you know, it's like what
red and blue lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think I put in there like plants use
green light to grow because we have this
[SPEAKER_01]: range called PAR, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the photosynthetically active
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so that was one of my first kind of
breakthroughs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking that, you know,
green light, you know, oh, it's not picked
[SPEAKER_01]: up by chlorophyll, but it does get
absorbed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, but it's used for
photosynthesis and really like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're trying to do as humans is
pinpoint one thing about the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: just say, we know what happens when really
there's every color is something
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different systems in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different receptors, all sorts of
things going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to disregard everything
that I just said, I'm going to break this
[SPEAKER_01]: down for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, with a, with a, I actually did a video
about this called plants, how plants use
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll break it down right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little extra information.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do plants use light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's a three step way to remember
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a C P R like, you know, resuscitating
somebody CPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it stands for capture photosynthesis
react.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's the three ways plants
interact with light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to stay with me,
there's going to be a longer answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give some more information of what
I've heard since that video and add it
[SPEAKER_01]: into the interview now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first was capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously for plants to do anything with
the light and has to capture it has to get
[SPEAKER_01]: into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you think about, you know,
a plant going like this is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: branches out, you know, it's growing
leaves for the vegetative process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's growing, it's seeking out where,
where light comes from and it's making a
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how it captures light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously how, how big the area,
like the leaves, how big they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how much light it can capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else is not hitting the plant
is not, not getting used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and another thing to think about is
direction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people don't think about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's a lot of videos out
there where people are testing grow lights
[SPEAKER_01]: by just taking a plant meter and going
like this and only seeing the light that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from above, but really light is
bouncing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting under the plant and the plant
is a 3d object.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you measure the light output from up
at top here, it's not going to be the same
[SPEAKER_01]: down here at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 3d object and lights coming from
multiple directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got all of this different
capturing going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really, you know, again,
where the plant is the direction of the
[SPEAKER_01]: light, if it's getting in between the
leaves or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the last thing is color.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you probably don't know this,
but every color, uh, penetrates and gets
[SPEAKER_01]: captured by the plant differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so let me do like a little cross
section of a leaf right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretend the leaf is like in,
in, in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So red and blue light will actually mostly
get blocked, especially narrow band LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have red and blue light usually
hits the top layer of the leaf cell and
[SPEAKER_01]: stops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if all of your light is concentrated on
the red and blue, this top layer will be
[SPEAKER_01]: like, just absorbed, like glowing with
light and the rest will be pretty dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what will happen if that's why those
red and blue lights give you a plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: Photo bleaching a lot because that narrow
band red and narrow band blue are
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated, getting absorbed in a really
small area of cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those cells get overworked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why those peaks, even though
it's really efficient, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can cheat on, uh, making a grow like
really efficient by using those,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to the plant, it's going to
absorb the top right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about other colors like
green, yellow, those will penetrate a
[SPEAKER_01]: little deeper into the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just the leaf and it's glowing
more of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get to infrared,
infrared will actually go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, it's capturing,
it's hitting actually more of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you think about there's another leaf
down here that's going to be getting green
[SPEAKER_01]: and infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's capturing it in multiple different
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's C capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got, it's 3d got direction and
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So C now we're onto P photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CPR P photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did capture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you just stay with me?
[SPEAKER_01]: So P stands for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how does photosynthesis happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, if you don't know about plants,
they use water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They use air and light to, to make all the
magic happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're, so they're bringing up water
to the leaves and something amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: happens in the leaves where, you know,
if you heard about plants breathing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're, they're making CO2 and
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happening is they're splitting
water out, oxygen and hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that part works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they make something called ATP,
which is an energy source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually two, two specific things
in the plant to call two photo systems
[SPEAKER_01]: that do this and the plant that's how
photosynthesis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to sound really smart,
you can, you can say, I know how the two
[SPEAKER_01]: photo systems of the plant works splits
water to make energy and makes this
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical called ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how photosynthesis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's how it interacts with light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it relates to Dr. Bugby's,
uh, you know, recent findings with
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared of why infrared is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two photo systems, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're first discovered by a man
named Dr. Emerson.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Dr. Emerson was like, Hey man,
like, I know we got this par range,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is just blue to red, but if I give a
plant infrared light and red light,
[SPEAKER_01]: it like gets us boosting growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's greater than the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one plus one equals three
instead of two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually not that dramatic, but you know,
that was the Emerson effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is you have photo
system one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And photosystem two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So photosystem two, I call the engine and
photosystem one, I call the supercharger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about a car, so if you
just turn on the supercharger,
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing's going to happen, which is
infrared light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you turn on the engine, well,
something's going to happen even without
[SPEAKER_01]: the supercharger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, photosystem one, supercharger,
photosystem two engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the engine does, it absorbs blue
through red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what the supercharger does is it
absorbs, uh, red through up through
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why if you give it both things,
it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The engine is going to work better,
more growth and they're linked together.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one splits water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second one makes ATP, but this one flows
into this one automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you don't need infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you give infrared to the plant,
it makes the growth go easier,
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker with the two photo systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just remember photosystem one,
photosystem two, photosystem one,
[SPEAKER_01]: the supercharger, photosystem two,
that engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue to red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one goes through infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the Emerson effect works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the power range is
outdated, which we'll get to a little
[SPEAKER_01]: later, but the power range was made in
1970.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did C, we did P and then we went to
R, which is they react.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants react.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two ways they most generally react is
to intensity and color.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lot of people don't realize is the
intensity actually can determine how big
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant gets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a low intensity light,
they'll get stretchy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have high intensity,
they'll stay compacted down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why in veg, I like to have my light
far away at a high brightness,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what will happen is that plant
will stay bushier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get into this a little later,
but you get kind of more of a wiggle room
[SPEAKER_01]: with play because light dynamics are more
even when the light's further away like
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, they react to intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing they react to is color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'll get into more of this
later, but the makeup of the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: really matters with how the shape it
grows, the yield it grows, the types of
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds it produces, the color all
matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to recap, C, P, R, capture,
photosynthesis, react.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how plants interact with light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about photoreceptors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are those and how is plant growth
impacted by them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, photoreceptors, it's basically a
plant's way of seeing with their eyes a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain color or a combination of colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are two types of
photoreceptors, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: For blue light, I made a note because I
don't remember them all, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: cryptochromes, phytotropins, ZTL,
FKF1, LKP2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I don't know why all these do,
but there's a lot with blue light and UVA
[SPEAKER_01]: light where they can sense that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A good way to kind of visualize this in
your head is if you give a plant no blue
[SPEAKER_01]: light, it will not think that there's any
light around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just made a grow light,
no blue light, it's going to stretch
[SPEAKER_01]: extraordinarily because it's not going to
have that signal that it normally gets
[SPEAKER_01]: that here is the presence of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to want to stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you add blue light, it's going to
say, OK, this is the direction of where
[SPEAKER_01]: the light is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, the more blue light you add,
generally speaking, the tighter
[SPEAKER_01]: internautal spacing the plant has,
the smaller the leaves get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes the plant more compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example of one photoreceptor
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one that's pretty common is
the phytochrome system, which is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: biological on and off slip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you ever wondered how your plants
know it's bedtime, well, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: phytochrome system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's P and then PFR, which we're
going to get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a far red one and a red one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want you to visualize the lights are
on in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red tank gets full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Click.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this is what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over appearing about two hours,
and then this gets full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is the plant goes,
it's nighttime, because this chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: reaction occurred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So red, far right over two hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can actually do is daytime
lights turn off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can give the plant just far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this switch happens sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen research where people can
give the plant a ton of far red light and
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce the darkness period, because this
reaction actually needs to occur for about
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 hours for the plant to realize,
hey, it's nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you need that 12 hours of
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hypothetically, if you sped this up,
you could get away with 11, 13 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's that reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of one of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this also, what it does, it detects
the amount of red and infrared in the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll get into this later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's that system that does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just described the two main groups of
photo systems, like the blue and the red
[SPEAKER_01]: and the infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's another thing I want to throw
at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a way to bypass both of them to
give the planet color that it can't even
[SPEAKER_01]: detect, which is green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why, in the beginning of Planet
Science, people were like, why go in my
[SPEAKER_01]: grow room with a green light on?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't wake them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, plants don't use green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just use red and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was kind of like a thing in people's
heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, you're just bypassing the
photoreceptors of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll ironically absorb it and use it for
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're bypassing the red and blue and
the red and far red with the green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you can go into your grow
room at night with the green headlamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not waking up the plant because
it's blind to it, even though it uses it
[SPEAKER_01]: for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something fascinating about
photoreceptors in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned a few light cycles there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to get a little bit deeper into
it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people give zero hours of
darkness, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They run their grow like 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other folks, for veg stage, some people do
18 hours on, 6 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do 20 hours on, 4 hours off
for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they go to flower,
there's a couple different light cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: that people traditionally do, which is 12
hours on, 12 hours off, or 11 hours on,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 hours off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What light cycles for veg and flower do
you generally recommend and why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant research I've seen, when plants
get damaged, they need an off time to
[SPEAKER_01]: recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, plants, they switch between what
they're exhaling and inhaling when the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights are on versus when the lights are
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not an expert on this,
but there are different flows in the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that occur when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, unless you're like a super
pro and you know the zero works for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: that dark period is a time for recovery
and reorganizing of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it can be healthier with that off
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 18 on, 6 off for veg is what I'd
recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: For flower, 12-12 is pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to play around with infrared,
you can maybe shave an hour off of your
[SPEAKER_01]: nighttime cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: To give it more de-light during the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really the only reason you need the 12
hours off is because of that time when the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs to think it's, you know,
it's fall time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why that 12 hours off is
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The on time really doesn't matter so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of auto flowers,
you know, a 18 on, 6 off, 20 and 4 can be
[SPEAKER_01]: helpful because you don't need,
it doesn't have that sensing to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does not sense night and day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why auto flowers, you can kind of
move through a cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not an expert on auto flowers,
but that's a whole nother like topic of
[SPEAKER_01]: niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you have some videos about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go watch some groups of growing videos
about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to know how that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we're generally speaking,
normal photo period plant, which senses
[SPEAKER_01]: night and day, 18 on, 6 off for veg and
then 12-12 for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about measuring light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different ways to measure light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will get a PAR meter and
they're like, oh, measure the PAR and they
[SPEAKER_00]: think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go after that number and that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are different ways to measure
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that in terms of like
color and wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different light
measurements out there and it gets very
[SPEAKER_01]: confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to break down the different
types and then we'll talk about the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first there's the color output that you
are measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we say PAR, what that means is red
to blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just the range of colors you're
measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the range of colors of PAR was defined
in 1970s, limited plant research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's the total output of the
light, which is PP, which is PDF,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is photon output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have PPFD, which is density
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is total output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then PPFD, which is at a certain spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And PPFD can actually be quite misleading
because a plant is 3D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially if you have a bar light and
like the ideal range is about six inches
[SPEAKER_01]: away and you're getting great numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You move that down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That number is going to change quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very difficult to really get a
good hand on what the plant is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you think about a giant cola that's
here, you know, you might get 1200 here
[SPEAKER_01]: and then 600 here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PPFD measurements are very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's best to kind of know the maximum of
what the plant is getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's color output, the total
output, and then the spot measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those all have different acronyms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you think about the colors,
there's PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Dr. Budby is doing some very
important research about infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his studies show that infrared in the
presence of other colors, does cause
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis at the same or greater rate
than other colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have a decision to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we make a new metric?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's called extended PAR,
which is EPAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So E-P-I-R.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is 400 blue to about 750,
which is in the infrared range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the metric that we use,
which was kind of like before EPAR was
[SPEAKER_01]: released.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a time when everyone was just
going crazy with these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's coming out like EPAR is blue
through infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have a B-PAR or P-BAR,
I've seen it both ways, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically, photobiologically active
radiation, which is the colors that affect
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, not the colors that actually cause
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is UV to infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's like 300 to like 780 or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, PAR, 1970.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's old, 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what most PAR meters will give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the EPAR, which is new, 400 to about
750.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then B-PAR, which is all the colors
that affect a plant, 300 to about 800,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a wider range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a grid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the types and they got the colors
and there's all different acronyms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you could do what we call,
instead of PPFD for biological,
[SPEAKER_01]: like BPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with EPAR, it would be like
E-PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most people just go after PAR or
DLI, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much PAR or DLI do you typically
recommend for medicinal varieties during
[SPEAKER_00]: the different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really like DLI or indoor just
because it's so hard to calculate.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said before, plants are a 3D.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the majority of your plant is not at
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of it is like halfway down or
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you think about measuring DLI
outside, it makes a lot more sense because
[SPEAKER_01]: if you take a PAR meter, raise it up above
your head, hold it at your chest,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be the same because the sun
is very far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: But indoors, if your grill light is here,
you're going to get all different numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: going through here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you calculate the DLI here,
well, what if you're growing bushy plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you got to map it out totally
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of just, I like to kind of
just say, hey, throw out the window,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe look at the PAR output of the light
instead of the PPF rating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to give a solid answer,
it's really the maximums that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for when you're dealing with a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the PPFD is more the intensity that it
can handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in veg, it's early veg like 200 to 400
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in veg, that's about four to six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in flower, it's eight to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is generally the intensity that
it can take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, a trick is, as I said before,
the distance matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a light that's this close
and you get 200 PPFD, it's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: getting quite dim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you move the meter up a little bit,
it might jump up to like 400.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within an inch, you're getting huge
variances.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why in seedlings and veg,
I like to have the light very far away
[SPEAKER_01]: because that means you move your meter
around where the plant goes around,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not wildly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, a low reading further away
is going to be stronger than that same
[SPEAKER_01]: reading when it's close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when it's close and you get a
thousand, you move an inch down,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to drop down to maybe like 500
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're far away and you get a thousand,
that's really bright because you move an
[SPEAKER_01]: inch down, it might go to 900.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a stronger light and it's more
forgiving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get these wild variances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my tip is try to get those
measurements, the light further away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant will understand it's a
brighter light and you can ramp it up to
[SPEAKER_01]: those higher intensities much faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you start with your light
really close at like 200 PPFD and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to ramp that light up, those leaves are
going to be pretty wimpy and you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow a whole new set and kind of train it
to get to a higher light source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you have something super bright,
far away, it's going to be used to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like a sunlight brightness from that grow
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of the answer that I give.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never really use a parm meter when
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all feel for me and understanding and
watching the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are the leaves turning light green?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it drooping?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see in the plant if it has too
much or too little light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely touched upon a little while
ago, a good reason why to have number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: an even canopy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, even light spread with the
grow light, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So having those two things, as you
mentioned, like it's so true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that your bud, the top bud could
be at 800 PPFD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But four or five inches lower than that,
everything else getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 600, 500 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, there's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two reasons why I should aim for
an even light spread and have a grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to actually emit even light
across the entire footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, good call out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into, I mean, you touched
upon IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's anything else to
be said about IR and how it impacts plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth or UV, you know, to maybe talk to
us about those two things, how they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, how they're beneficial for plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about IR first.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's something actually pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like, because it's like,
infrared is a thing because it's normally
[SPEAKER_01]: not in grow lights or LEDs these days,
which is not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, now we have to talk about
how does the plant respond without
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared and how does it respond with
infrared?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, going back to Emerson effect,
it causes a little more growth
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically when you introduce
infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get more growth, not by like
massive leaps and bounds, on a
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetic level, but you can get
leaps and bounds with some other benefits,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is it acts upon
the plant in several different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first, it will actually cause the
leaves to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the leaves get bigger,
then the plant is actually absorbing more
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you give it infrared, it less
becomes the infrared is doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant has just grown bigger leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore all the light that it gets is
going to be greater.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that too, if you think about
that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it also helps with branching and
that will cause more nodes to hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So remember I talked about before in the,
I think it was the capture part,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about different colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So infrared will go through the leaves
along with green light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think about a plant down here,
I got the shadow on my hand, there we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this would be like more infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the phytochrome receptor
that we all learned about comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's off kilter and it's like,
whoa, I need to reach for the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have infrared,
that response is just not as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting a plant that's,
they're all gonna, boom, hit the canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll get more sites that can get
more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting more photosynthesis,
the leaves are getting bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: capturing more and you're getting more
nodes hitting to where there is light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this kind of, especially in
bed, you get this really nice boost in
[SPEAKER_01]: growth with infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can cause like, people will say
infrared causes stretching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like the sun has a huge amounts of
infrared and plants grow great out there
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a balanced spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they'll say it's wasted, which is not
true anymore because we've proven that
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared does cause great growth and it's
photosynthetically active.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have infrared in your grow
light, it's gonna give you those benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like night and day, but they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you get into having
the maximum amount of light, you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: want other colors to kind of fill that out
because you're not maxing out on the other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so just to recap, you get more
growth, leaf expansion, better branching
[SPEAKER_01]: and overall bigger, faster growing plant,
especially in pitch.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: UV, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some actually controversy
behind this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some people saying that
there's studies in regards to it increases
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome production, stuff like that,
but then there's stuff debunking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your take on UV?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you know about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back in the day, when people use UV,
it was a stress to plant out to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes, which it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I think Bruce, Dr. Bud,
we talked about this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stress causes that response.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, if you dose a plant with those old
UV fluorescent bulbs, it's gonna cause it
[SPEAKER_01]: to stress out and may give you the result
that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you could probably get the same
result by giving it drought, giving it
[SPEAKER_01]: heat, those sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, that becomes less about the
UV and more about the stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And blue light also causes stress in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I think we're seeing that a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I know, it's like going back to kind
of like, think about a whole plate of
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You work the best on a whole plate of
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have, if you like, don't eat
your greens, you can survive, but will you
[SPEAKER_01]: be like the very best if you don't eat
your greens or veggies?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's kind of like UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a little piece on the plate
of food that is there and will help the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant grow better slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what we're finding is
if you include it, this could,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like night and day difference,
but it does help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've seen or heard, I heard,
and this is who I was talking to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in veg, you can get basically like
it's a glycogen store, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: with UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it stores, it opens a pathway in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in flour, it'll actually release it
with UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's true or not,
but it has benefits in flour and veg that
[SPEAKER_01]: are slight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the key is a little bit goes a
long way instead of just trying to stress
[SPEAKER_01]: out the plant with UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then there's also like UVC,
UVB and UVA.
[SPEAKER_01]: UVC is like cancer causing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they were using that to kill
coronavirus like way back in the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: super dangerous UVB.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's normally not so much in the sun,
so that's dangerous too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And UVA is really what the, what you're
looking for giving the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get a sunburn from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's those, the different ranges of
UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know you can give too much UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually do too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are getting light burn is
often what it's called too, but is there
[SPEAKER_00]: really such thing as light burn or is it
just oftentimes it said it's just a lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is working harder with the
increased leg intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's just a lack of nutrients
in the medium and that people should just
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the nutrients in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So answer that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there such thing as too much light or
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you think about the sun,
it's extraordinarily bright, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes the sun will burn your
plants outside just cause they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with a grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way I like to think about it is,
as I said before, when you introduce your
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings to that high light intensity at
a far distance, you're training it to get
[SPEAKER_01]: used to that really bright light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't do that, and then you all
all of a sudden get it like a close light
[SPEAKER_01]: range, it's gonna fry and burn because
those leaves are just not thick and ready
[SPEAKER_01]: for that high amount of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, our Electric Sky V3 has
what I consider like if you're running
[SPEAKER_01]: that thing max power, I mean kudos hats
off to you because it's 2000 PPFD here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if your plant, which is outside
sunlight intensity, but if your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: able to handle that, which some growers,
they've trained their plants very well,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're very healthy, they're not gonna
have a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get to those levels,
you're just stressing the crap out of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think mistakes just happen faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're cramming the plant with tons
of light, can you handle mistakes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna run out of water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are your nutrients in check?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the healthiest that it can be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's not, you're gonna fall off
a cliff and it's gonna start to get
[SPEAKER_01]: damaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get a little bit of damage,
then boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, unless you can get too
much light, depending on your environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's where CO2 comes in,
so the plant can actually handle more of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get a curve of where more light
doesn't get you the same results anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, is there too much light
for a new grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like absolutely, like a 1000 watt LED grow
light, like actually 1000 watts in a four
[SPEAKER_01]: by four is gonna roast probably like
everything if you run it full power.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like too much for that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you actually gonna get more
yield with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it wasted?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of where I would go in my
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about new science in regards to
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like we're finding out things,
more and more new things are happening
[SPEAKER_00]: within science.
[SPEAKER_00]: What new science in regards to lighting
for plants has come out in the past year
[SPEAKER_00]: or so?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Dr. Bugbee with the infrared,
that's pretty big with actually proving
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluence actually did a study about our
favorite medicinal plant showing they gave
[SPEAKER_01]: it a baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like this is actually like yield in
the medicinal plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did a baseline of light and added
like this much white light or this much
[SPEAKER_01]: infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the infrared, you can see like a
sizable gain over white light,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only does it both synthetically
active, but they showed there is a slight
[SPEAKER_01]: gain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just did that in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did not recognize any of the
benefits that you might get in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because usually with infrared,
you get a bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't study that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they showed that, which is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think now, I think it's harder to find
breakthroughs because if you think about
[SPEAKER_01]: it many years ago, we didn't think green
light caused growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't think infrared caused growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's kind of like, okay,
you're getting into the nitty gritty of
[SPEAKER_01]: like UV and you're gonna get lots of
conflicting plant science articles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what I found is sometimes you can run
the same experiment twice and you get
[SPEAKER_01]: different results because something else
is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're just gonna find the fine
tune of what, where, and there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things you can study.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really kind of we're getting to the end
of understanding a lot of what light does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, what do you see happening
with plant lighting over the next three to
[SPEAKER_00]: five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't think efficiency is gonna be
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're there in terms of
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your plant doesn't understand
efficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of people are caught up
in like a number that's advertised and the
[SPEAKER_01]: home grower, like I don't even know how
many watts my refrigerator pulls from the
[SPEAKER_01]: wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, where is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, is your refrigerator more
efficient than your grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who knows, it's usually this much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I think is becoming less
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not actually sure because it seems
like there's just more wattage,
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're gonna see just different
brands do different things with their
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting and maybe a consolidation there,
but kind of seems like everyone is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see how long it can last,
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, people are so nitpicky when it comes
to the efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like 2.8, 2.9 micro moles
per joule and then a light will come out
[SPEAKER_00]: where it's like 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, you're comparing prices
like 2.8 micro moles per joule,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do I wanna pay the extra two,
$300 for that 3.0?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy how people are so nitpicky and
they want the best of the best as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 0.1, that's like 3% difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you do 3.0 difference between 2.8?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's not very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5% or 7%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and then at that point it's like
output.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like even lights at different output
ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get like 10 more watts here,
even measuring the light is so confusing
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can put it into a sphere,
you can do a map, but all of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really at the end of the day yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually what's fascinating is,
and here's another tidbit is it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: red and blue light is like the most
efficient grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get like, I think up to four
U-mole, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look at a spectral chart and
you see it has a lot of blue, the blue is
[SPEAKER_01]: really efficient too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even Dr. Bugby even said in a previous
video that red is 30% more efficient at
[SPEAKER_01]: creating growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking at a U-mole and
you're like, man, this one's a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: U-mole, but it has more blue than this
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's the plant gonna think,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a better reading on paper and
then plant growth is just not something
[SPEAKER_01]: you can like say or like give it a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something to think about too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look for that blue spike, the higher
the blue spike, higher the red spike,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're concentrating energy on those two
areas and it's gonna be more efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it might not always translate to plant
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are we gonna see any new or updated
grow lights from the Green Sunset Company
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2022 or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on a few things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing to directly replace what we have
going on now with the 300s and 180s,
[SPEAKER_01]: but perhaps around when this video is
released, something will be around the
[SPEAKER_01]: corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do something a little
different than everybody else as always,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of wrapping things up,
how can listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything you got upcoming in
the future that you want to talk about or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, visitors can find us on our
website, TheGreenSunshineCo.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have our new, we did a revamp of
our grow kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got grow kits with earth dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about nutrients and
all, but earth dust is our amendments that
[SPEAKER_01]: you add to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got everything you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all the microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes it super easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just gonna continue doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can also find us on
Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also Mr. Grow It's channel right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be sure to link your channel down in
the description section below and also the
[SPEAKER_00]: website as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coupon code, coupon code, Mr. Grow It will
get you a percentage off, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's still active.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So earth dust, you can save on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can save on, I think anything on your
website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anything on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got kits, lights, and nutrients.
