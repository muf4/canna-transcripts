[SPEAKER_00]: What is up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: today I've got a PAR test video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ROI E680 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did an unboxing video on my
main channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that in the description section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm just gonna do the PAR
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not gonna be talking about any of
the features or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meter I'm using is the Apogee MQ500.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measures just a certain range.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures from 389 nanometers to 692
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus or minus 5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any light is being emitted from this
grow light outside of that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will not be shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the listing for this light,
it emits 1700 microwelts per second PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter is gonna measure in PPFD,
so it's a spot check.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not sure what I mean by PPF or
PPFD, you may want to read my buyer's
[SPEAKER_00]: guide on LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I explain what those are in that article
as well as some other good information
[SPEAKER_00]: that is good to know when searching for an
LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that buyer's guide in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for this light I'm gonna take four
different height measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna start off six inches,
which is what it says in the owner's
[SPEAKER_00]: manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll go up to eight inches,
which is what it says I believe on their
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go to 12 inches and then I'll do one
that's 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: This does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the screen I'll show what percent it is
dimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it starts off at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can dim it down to 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then 60%, then 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye on the screen and then
you'll see what percentage this unit is
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start off six inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a two inch sensor, so really the
height is six inches from the top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really not gonna talk in this video,
maybe towards the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna let the measurements do the
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so I will actually be growing
with this light and I just wanted to take
[SPEAKER_00]: a few minutes to go over kind of the
results and what I'm going to hang the
[SPEAKER_00]: light at for the different stages of
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when my plants are in seedling stage,
or if I'm putting any clones underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: it, I think I'm gonna do 24 inches away
dimmed down to 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the PPFD reading dead center was
at 380.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reading actually in the last,
the corner diode when I brought that
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor up all the way into the corner,
right underneath that last diode is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of where I paused the video and I got a
319 reading on that corner diode.
[SPEAKER_00]: For seedlings and clones, I usually aim
between 200 and 400 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's right there in that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my plants are in the vegetation
stage, I think I'm gonna do, I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple different measurements here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure which one I'm gonna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 24 inches away, 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% dimmed, dead center comes in at 750
and then that corner diode comes in at
[SPEAKER_00]: 580.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for plants in the vegetation stage,
between 400 and 600 PPFD is what I aim
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another height distance that appealed to
me was 12 inches away, 40% dimmed down to,
[SPEAKER_00]: dead center came in at 554 and then that
corner diode came in at 359 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right in the range where I wanna be for
vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that 12 inch distance at 40% is
for early veg, because the PPFD number is
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on in veg, it looks like
the 24 inches away, 80% would be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: better for late in the vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to flowering, I actually
have three different distances here that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuck out for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess for early flower, maybe 12
inches away, 60% dimmed down, dead center
[SPEAKER_00]: came in at 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corner diode came in at 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually between 600 and 900 PPFD is
what I aim for in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another distance that stuck out was 24
inches away, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dead center was 922 and that corner
diode was 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last one that stuck out for flowering
was 12 inches away, 80%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came in at 1120 PPFD in the dead center
and then 750 on that corner diode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of you guys might say 1120,
that's a little bit too much for plants of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially since I just said I like to go
for 600 to 900 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way you can get away with running a
higher PPFD, the one I recommended is
[SPEAKER_00]: running CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually do, I have been running CO2,
this last grow on my phenome grow series
[SPEAKER_00]: on my Patreon page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did run those CO2 canisters by TMB
Naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just having an additional 100 to 200
PPM of CO2 added to my amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: environment will allow me to run a higher
PPFD number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I figured I'd mention that
one, that one stuck out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I have for measurements,
what I think I'm gonna run.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about these
measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
