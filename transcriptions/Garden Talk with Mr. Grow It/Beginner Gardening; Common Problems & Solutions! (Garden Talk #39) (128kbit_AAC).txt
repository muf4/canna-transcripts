[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This current grow I just switched to Gaia
Green and I'm loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just amending my soil and you leave
it alone for whatever three weeks and you
[SPEAKER_00]: top dress or you transplant and you amend
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of guys use the clear solo
cups and they'll put that inside another
[SPEAKER_00]: solo cup so that then they can just pull
it out and just to see how the roots are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water your plants 12 hours in advance,
he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps loosen them up and that way you
can bend them a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get to the vegetative stage I'm
able to start getting into a routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm watering, when am I feeding,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: When am I training?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the flowering I'm never sure
how much to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been one of my main problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna make lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't freak out if things aren't
going right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast this episode number 39.

he has experience with both organics and
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode we focus on beginner
gardening.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with the Rookie Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get into some beginner
gardening type stuff today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So super excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on the podcast, I know you tune
in every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of intermediate, advanced style
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely want to have an episode
where we kind of bring it back and get
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the basics, back to the
fundamentals, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that watch me that are new
to growing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on their first grow, second grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get people all the time that comment and
say, I just planted my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do I do next type thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a lot of people ask me what problems
will I run into?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what we're going to get
into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that would be a good episode to
talk about problems that frequently occur
[SPEAKER_01]: when gardening and not only that,
but solutions, you know, what you can do
[SPEAKER_01]: to prevent those problems from happening
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought you'd be a good candidate to
have on here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we actually get into the nitty
gritty of things, can you tell us a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit about yourself and kind of how you got
into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you all know, I'm TRG.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Canadian.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a medical license holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started growing around three years
ago when it was legalized in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my spare time, I work on my YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once it was legalized, I started
realizing that I could grow for myself as
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed medicine, just like everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, it can get quite
pricey when you're buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to start growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did my first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually went very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got about eight ounces off four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured that was pretty good for my
first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured, hey, this is easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this locked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went into my second grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, nah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got like maybe four ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't very good at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of got a little bit discouraged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, well, let's do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did a third one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still making mistakes, still screwing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was starting to get frustrated this
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by that time, I'm kind of like,
well, what am I going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And through all these grows so far,
it's just been autos that I've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done any photos yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided I was going to try photos
because I had read that they are a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more accepting to mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're stressing out the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have time to recover from that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I decided to finally try
photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, it went through fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple of plants that looked
stressed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I ended up getting 11 ounces off them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a fairly decent grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm into my second grow for photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going very well, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you say your overall grow
style is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are you an indoor grower,
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow in soil or cocoa or
hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow style, I am an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That went horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I did that, I decided to just
focus on the indoor, focus on the basics,
[SPEAKER_00]: get the basics down, and then we'll worry
about the outdoors after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides that, I grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get it just a basic soil with
some of them with the mycorrhizae in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do my dry amendments in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've started in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying I'm never going to try
anything else, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: DWC scares the hell out of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So indoor grower, tell us a little bit
about your current grow setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what size grow space are you
working in?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got for lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any automation, so on and so
forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my current grow, I'm growing in a
four by four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a CMH 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still rocking that thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a unit farm UF 3000 that they
sent to me to try out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my light system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just set up blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into the watering automation and I'm
kind of liking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you just started it,
so I don't know how you're liking them so
[SPEAKER_00]: far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been using them for a couple
years now actually on and off a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used them a while back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had some issues with over watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the medium was just too saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I added the blue mats in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kept that saturation rate,
which was like too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of getting into problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a perfect transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the first things is
watering that we want to talk about when
[SPEAKER_01]: we talk about problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, blue mats definitely can be
a hands off thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually just installed blue mats to
this morning on my current grill and I
[SPEAKER_01]: watered the plant a couple days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got nice and saturated the way I like
it, not over saturated, but waited a day
[SPEAKER_01]: or two and then suck the blue mats in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm at the point where I'm going
to, you know, doing those little
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments to make sure that's dialed in
and it's not just dripping down more than
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm in the same stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adjusting small adjustments,
you know, watching the drip and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's not dripping too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about other problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about problems with watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you were doing hand watering
before this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything to kind of talk about
with problems of watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a horrible waterer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from over watering to under
watering back to over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I just, this current grill,
I just killed six seedlings because I
[SPEAKER_00]: just, I sprayed them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what am I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of, I'm happy that that
happened because I kind of lit a fire
[SPEAKER_00]: under my butt to say, you know what,
let's start getting a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: serious about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I can see it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girl is looking fantastic right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but yeah, again, my mostly I've
been over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my biggest problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy to overwater and you know,
we can, you can talk about the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: finger technique in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, your first finger knuckle down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's completely bone dry at that point,
then there's watering and then lifting the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow pot to check the weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are different techniques
you can do, but particularly in the solar,
[SPEAKER_01]: solo solo cups, it's so easy to just
overwater those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, if you've, if you stunt
the plant within the first seven days of
[SPEAKER_01]: grow, like you could literally plant new
seeds and those new seeds would grow
[SPEAKER_01]: faster than the stunted plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there has been grows where I've
overwatered solo cups and had to start
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's some people would say just
start over at that point, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can certainly be tricky on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seem to do better once I get into the
bigger pots and then I'm able to water and
[SPEAKER_00]: judge better, but it's the small ones that
throw me off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I like to use, I like, uh,
I like using a turkey baster, just a small
[SPEAKER_00]: turkey baster and, uh, one or two squirts
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just leave it alone for four or
five days and check on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, you know, if you're starting
in the bigger pots, kind of watering
[SPEAKER_01]: directly around the seedling and just kind
of doing that circular motion,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause certainly if you just have a
seedling within the first week or two and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in a five gallon container,
for example, or a larger container,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need to soak the whole grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be spending seven, 10, 14 days for
that thing to dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could easily stunt the plant if,
if that medium is oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else with watering anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, again, like I said, I went from
overwatering to under watering or I was
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting too long in between and then they
were drying out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I corrected it and I started overwatering
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like under watering is,
you know, less, less impactful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'll see the droop and easily
recover off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, depending on how old the plant is
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have a small seedling
that could medium dries up to the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing could die.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the whole plant could die
pretty, pretty easily there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a larger plant, you know,
in the vegetation stage, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that major droop to the point
where, you know, you might open up your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent once the light comes on and it
looks like the plant's dead, but you water
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, a couple hours later it's
back up to normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can totally be, be tricky, but with a
little bit of practice, you can definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: dial things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been, um, you know, I've grown in
solo cups to start a four inch nursery
[SPEAKER_01]: pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they even a little bit smaller than,
uh, solo cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding myself planting now in one
gallon containers more and more just
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out in one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's just, it's seems to be a
little bit more beneficial in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I'm able to have that
initial saturation to the way I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the transplant less, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a sense, not as, let's say not as
often, but it takes me a little while till
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to actually transfer comparison to
a, when I'm in a solo cup at the
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant sooner is what I'm trying to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try putting the starting them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the ones I killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started them in the one gallons and I
killed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was thinking the same lines as
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, I'd rather started in the
one gallon and give it more room for the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots to expand right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, instead of these little solo
cups and waiting for it to, but it didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know, a little bit of
practice and experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, feeding nutrients is another thing
where people have a lot of problems with,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you a bottle grower or you do
organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, what problems have you come
across there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I started a bottles and I always felt like
I was underfeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always looked faded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They always, you know, I just,
I found I wasn't feeding them enough and
[SPEAKER_00]: probably just because I didn't know when
they were supposed to be fed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is just this current grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just switched to Gaia green and I'm
loving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love just amending my soil and you leave
it alone for whatever three weeks and you
[SPEAKER_00]: top dress or you transplant and you amend
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but, uh, this is probably the best my
grow has ever looked since I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really love the Gaia green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a problem with the dry amendments
that people come across a lot is they,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, they switch from bottles to the dry
amendments and they don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medium should be saturated at all
times that you don't have that dry out
[SPEAKER_01]: period that often people do with
synthetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you would water the pot,
let the medium dry out, then rewater like
[SPEAKER_01]: with synthetics with, uh, you know,
organics, you need that saturation because
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes need to be active.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes aren't active.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go dormant into a sleep state if the
medium is dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the medium wet, not wet,
I don't know what's kind of a bad word,
[SPEAKER_01]: but saturated, I guess you could say,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe even saturated might be,
it might be a bad word to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's moist to the point where microbes
can be active and even that top layer,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the first things,
like if you don't have, if you're organics
[SPEAKER_01]: and don't have a multilayer, for example,
when that grow lights beaming down on
[SPEAKER_01]: that, one of the first things to dry out
is that top layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where your dry amendments are,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing the top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spraying the top of the medium in order
to keep it moist is a common practice that
[SPEAKER_01]: people do in order to avoid that from
happening, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm doing now is I'm using rice
hulls as a mulch to try and help keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that's been helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use barley straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also cover crops is another thing that can
be used to kind of help maintain the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture level down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on getting into all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Baby steps, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it costs, you know, money and time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to learn.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how about pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, PPM, EC, you know, back when you
would, were you doing that stuff when you
[SPEAKER_01]: did synthetic bottle nutrients or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching my PPMs a lot and I was
watching my pH, but I had cheap Amazon pH
[SPEAKER_00]: pens and PPM pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty sure that my pH pen kept
going off and I was having a lot of pH
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just bought, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apera?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just bought that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm liking that one so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Apera one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually several different models
for Apera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly recommend Apera as well,
rather than those cheap ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also definitely recommend keeping your
pH meter in storage solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those probes will dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're spending $75 on a pH
pen and it's dead within a year because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't put it in storage solution,
well, you can try to claim the warranty on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, the one year warranty or
whatever, but for the most, that's still a
[SPEAKER_01]: pain to go through that whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keeping it in storage solution is
definitely, one of those things that I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like is a must.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's the thing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you get the one from Amazon,
the cheap one, you don't get no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no kind of solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just stored in whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you check the, were you checking
the pH of the nutrient solution going in
[SPEAKER_01]: or the runoff or were you doing a slurry
test or how would you kind of track pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was making sure my water's pH was 6.3 to
6.5 and then I would check my runoff as
[SPEAKER_00]: well just to make sure to try and get the
runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, the pH of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I was doing and it was kind
of working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting it for a little bit,
but it just, it's not my style.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, you know, it gives you a general
idea of what the pH is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly when we're talking about the
runoff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There have been people who have hit me up
in the past that say you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: checking runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be doing a slurry test instead
or getting a probe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He actually said that checking the runoff
was the wrong way to do it, which you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, that's an alternate way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an alternate way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give you a general idea of
what the pH is in that, in the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a slurry test for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just take some of the medium out of the
top of it, mix it in with some distilled
[SPEAKER_01]: water, then check the pH that way or get
one of those probes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those, those probes, soil probes that go
into the actual soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Lab has one, but they're what,
like 165?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're pretty pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a Piro, doesn't a Piro have one
too?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think they might, they might have
one of those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, PPM or EC, were you tracking those at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching my PPM for my nutrients
when I was mixing my water and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't, I don't know much about EC yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still getting there, but yeah,
I was just moderating my PPMs in my water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you also do a runoff to kind of
check it or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that, yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was checking my runoff for PPMs as well
and I was using that to determine when I
[SPEAKER_00]: should feed and I don't know if that was
the best way to be doing it, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: The general way to do it, a lot of people
do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to spend a hundred
and whatever dollars for that soil probe
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of get a more accurate way when,
you know, the runoff method that's cheaper
[SPEAKER_01]: way and you can get a general idea of what
it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still do it, but there is a lot of
guessing when, when you're doing that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to, you know,
you get that runoff measurement and let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say hypothetically it's the runoff's five
hundred and you're aiming for a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do for your mixture?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people would do a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a thousand PPM and then put it in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the wrong way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you already have roughly 500 PPM in
your medium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would add it to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your PPM coming out should be around
1500.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now again, this is just a, you know,
it gives you a general range.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could check the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be way above that or below
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to kind of guesstimate,
you know, cause if you're doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding, when the soil dries out,
you got to factor in how many nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant has uptaken, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your last runoff measurement was 800
and you let the soil dry out, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: three, four days later, well, it's still
not going to be, it's not going to be 800
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used up some of the nutrients that
are already in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to kind of guesstimate on that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see a lot of people running into that
as a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wish there was a better solution out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I wish those probes were
cheaper, but unfortunately this is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're at at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be something that comes along.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about transplanting?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever had any problems doing
transplanting?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm actually not that I'm an expert at
it, but I do pretty well at transplanting.
[SPEAKER_00]: No real issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my method where I just make my mold
in my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get my plants or my soil already ahead
of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take an empty container and I put the
soil in around it and then I just pull up
[SPEAKER_00]: this and it just pops right into the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, besides that, no real,
no real issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a common problem is knowing when
to transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are some general guides
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're in a solo cup, for example,
what I've heard multiple times,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I've heard and kind of go by
sometimes is this the earliest to
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant is when the leaves kind of
reach the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like grow and they really,
they reach the outer edges of the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's the earliest time you
should transplant, you know, let it grow
[SPEAKER_01]: more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a more dense root ball that
helps keep that medium compact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have come across, I've transplanted
before where I go to transplant and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden the medium crumbles up because
the root zone isn't established.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so kind of knowing when to
transplant, I feel like can be difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've popped plants out of,
you know, slowly, gently brought it out to
[SPEAKER_01]: see if there was a root zone that's
developed and then kind of I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: ah, no, not really want to be at slide it
back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can certainly do that if you're a
beginner and you're not really sure if the
[SPEAKER_01]: root ball has developed or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a lot of guys use the clear solo
cups and they'll put that inside another
[SPEAKER_00]: solo cup so that then they can just pull
it out and just to see how the roots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great, great call out right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that clear cup within another cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is important to have the, just not have
a clear cup because light hitting the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots, no bueno, not good at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also algae is a thing that people
can come across as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If light penetrates down there and it's
saturated medium, algae can certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two reasons why I kind of have
a dark container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was looking at THC Titans
Instagram page and this was several months
[SPEAKER_01]: ago and some company made white fabric
grow pots and the thing was just loaded
[SPEAKER_01]: with algae all around because the light
was piercing through that grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's, that's a huge,
I don't even know why the company made,
[SPEAKER_01]: made a white grow pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we're thinking or something,
but yeah, those are a couple of problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that happen with transplanting that I've
come across or seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a little weird to go white.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about training plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do training, whether it
be, you know, topping low stress training,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, super cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: What training do you do and what problems
have you kind of come across?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, in the past, I mostly just,
just gently bent them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to call it super cropping,
but somebody told me, no, that's not super
[SPEAKER_00]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tried with the tie downs and what
else was I trying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's all I tried before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried topping, but I didn't do a lot of
topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just topped a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: This grow that I'm doing now, now I've
topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I topped like almost everyone that came
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the first time I'm really
topping and I have canopy clips,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm using to spread out the plant,
which they're great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend them for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canopy clips are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you don't have to worry about
tying it down with wires and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those canopy clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Problems that I've come across while
snapping branches, I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in your low stress training, snapping that
branch, that's usually a heartbreaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, manipulating the top part of the
branch is one way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the top part of the branch is a
little bit softer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know if you bring your temps real low,
you know, real low, the sixties degree
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit in the fifties, those branch
will kind of harden up less chances of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to manipulate those plants,
you know, bend those plants without them
[SPEAKER_01]: snapping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure your temperatures are in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a good solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: When tying down, I use the wire ties and I
have like a clip that kind of clips to the
[SPEAKER_01]: pot and then use the wire ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has been times where I've actually,
you know, tied it down and the branch grew
[SPEAKER_01]: into the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had that happen before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do just a loop around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't actually like tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, it's just kind of like a
little hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even if it's wrapped around twice,
it'll kind of unwind, you know what I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus, you know, like a bread,
like when you're tying, doing like a bread
[SPEAKER_01]: tie, you know, twisting it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I avoid twisting it together at all
costs in order to try to prevent the
[SPEAKER_01]: branch from growing into the tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else I've seen other guys
starting to use is, I think they're
[SPEAKER_00]: called, I can't remember now, grass clips
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about three inches long and that's
all you do is you just push it down into
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil with the branch in it and it just
pushes it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of using the ties, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what they're called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do any super cropping at all or
no?
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the guy, one guy told me that
I was doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess I was because he was saying
you got to do that big pinch and you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it to bend over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just gently bending them over.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the tip that he did give me was to
water your plants 12 hours in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said it helps loosen them up and that
way you can bend them a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then silica as well will help with
kind of branch manipulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using silica definitely helps
when training plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got silica in there right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it for IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about controlling environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, easier said than done,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember the first time I ever set up a
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I thought it was going to be
easy to get the temperature stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was going to be easy to get
the humidity where I wanted it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you add in the exhaust fan and all of
a sudden it sucks out all the humidity out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you put your your HPS grow light in
there and the temperature skyrockets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what do you do to control the
environment to kind of help stabilize your
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing that I, well,
I just upgraded my exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up buying an AC infinity T6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that thing's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One punch of a button and you can control
your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the most control I've ever had
over my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm pretty lucky where I am because my
relative humidity is roughly around 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: My house anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing I'm using right now is a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use a heater.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use AC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to use any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just my natural environment just is
very ideal for what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides that, lots of fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got all these different fans that I use
iPad stands so that way I can put them at
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels and you just put the fan
on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got about four or five fans going to
keep the airflow and just have one blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: right on the lights to try and reduce the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's about it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and I have a fan blowing air into my
tent through the vent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely some good techniques in
order to help control the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have the AC infinity fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a game changer, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, you know, certain set points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the temperature reaches,
I think I have one set to 82 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it reaches that it'll start to
another fan will slowly turn on and then
[SPEAKER_01]: exhaust some of that hot air, you know,
and exchange the air as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously if it's moving some of the air
and then once the temperature drops down,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause the air coming in from the intake
vent on my grow tent, it's cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does drop it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in a very dry environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do have humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have humidifier in my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have humidifier outside of my tent in
order to try to make sure that the air
[SPEAKER_01]: coming into the tent is of the proper
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, back in the day I used to struggle
because, you know, my natural humidity is
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, 30%, you know, so it's like,
even if, if I only have a humidifier
[SPEAKER_01]: inside my grow tent, well that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll, it'll boost it up to where it needs
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once that inline fan kicks on AC
infinity, well it's bringing in 20 to 30%
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So having, making sure that I have a
humidifier outside just in my grow room as
[SPEAKER_01]: well is definitely helpful for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have one in your lung room that helps
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lung room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I mean by that.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the seedling stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any problems in particular?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go through the different stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start seedling, then we'll go into
veg, then we'll go into flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedling stage besides I kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I struggle with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why yet, but I guess cause
they're so fragile, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can, it doesn't take much to kill
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully I'll get that under control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had problems with frying seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, particularly with HPS,
you know, back in the day when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: running HPS, I, you know, having that
light too close, you know, I used to think
[SPEAKER_01]: the more light, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it'll die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fried seedlings before cause I had
the light too close.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on the flip side, having the
temperature of the medium too low has
[SPEAKER_01]: hindered seedling growth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So particularly in winter time,
you know, if you're putting your solo
[SPEAKER_01]: cups, for example, if you're putting them
on the ground or actually any container on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground, you could come across where
the medium is too low in temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It slows down microbial growth,
slows down growth just entirely,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that has definitely hindered growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are basement
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Common mistake for basement growers is
they put it directly on the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the cold, coldness just
completely stunts the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it gets really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets quite cold where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm talking minus 30 minus 40
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that basement floor is quite cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: I raise them up a little bit, get them
about an inch off the ground just so that
[SPEAKER_00]: they got airflow underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you raise it up with?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like crates and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever is handy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's whatever I can use to get up and
off the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used like two by fours before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that works too.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the vegetation stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any problems come to mind for the veg
stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been one of my stages that I
actually do well in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I get to the vegetative stage,
then I'm able to start getting into a
[SPEAKER_00]: routine of when I'm watering, when am I
feeding, when am I training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably why I like it because
it's more of a routine rather than a
[SPEAKER_00]: seeding stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, besides that, I haven't had too
many problems with my vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetative stage arguably is one of the
easier stages in my opinion, especially if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're growing in a soil that is enriched
with nutrients already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Foxtail moisture for soil, that's going to
last you roughly 30, 40 days depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of your container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the plant's out of the seedling
stage, it's still got plenty of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most people aren't doing any sort of
feeding all the way up until some people
[SPEAKER_01]: go all the way at 30, 40 days and then put
the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do any feeding of veg at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my opinion, the veg stage is one of
the easier stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: One problem that I can think of is knowing
when to flip to flower because just the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that you don't know how long,
how much it's going to stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cultivar dependent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously your lighting's going to impact
it, your nutrition, there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different variables that are going to
impact growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had plants that were stretched three
times the amount once I flipped to 12,
[SPEAKER_01]: 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I ran out of height.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's stretched three times the amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't expecting that much of a stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my light's all the way up to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your bending branch is down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a common problem that people
actually reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh crap, I ran out of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do now?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the options?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either pruning those branches off
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're week one into stretch or you
know you're going to have a couple more
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally pruning branches off that are
the top branches off is an option at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point without destroying your yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people have yield as their goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't, but certainly it could
be an impact there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The general rule of thumb is just expect
the plant to stretch double the amount it
[SPEAKER_01]: is at the time of flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, usually for the first three weeks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have cultivars that don't stretch at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had cultivars which I expected them
to stretch 2X and they didn't barely even
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh crap, stuck with a small
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was expecting it to stretch so much
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're stuck at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to finish growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have the same problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm never quite sure when to flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm always kind of guessing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Problems in flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with the flowering, I'm never sure
how much to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been one of my main problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I was supposed to
increase or decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, it's no different than
the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're still in your routine,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you're not doing is really
training anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless, like you said, it's getting too
close to the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it's just basically when to flip
and my feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure about the feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had plants yellow out too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a common problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants start to yellow, week four,
five, and you're like, oh crap,
[SPEAKER_01]: why is it starting to yellow at this
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of goes back to the
fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing with bottled nutrients,
what's the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the PPM?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in the proper ranges?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're organic growing, well,
maybe you didn't top it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't top dress enough during that
flip like you should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe the medium is drying out on the top
where your top dressing amendments are and
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes aren't breaking them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things you've got to kind
of look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another problem in flowering is when you
get to the point where you are at week
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six, seven, and they start flopping
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having support for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of planting a head on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to use tomato cages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever tried to put a
tomato cage on a plant that's in week six
[SPEAKER_01]: or seven and flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like trying to put it above.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's so difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, planting a head,
making sure you have like a trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a lot of people use trellis
net for support, not just to get a high
[SPEAKER_01]: yield, but using it as support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stakes are good to have on hand for
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use those yo-yos and they hang
them from above and they come down and
[SPEAKER_01]: help support those branches above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use like those bamboo stakes
and they'll kind of square them in similar
[SPEAKER_01]: to how a tomato cage is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so many different ways you can
go when it comes to supporting your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and make sure the branches stay upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you know, other things look at
calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, silica can help with the cell
structure and keeping plants upright.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think that's a common problem
is plants flopping all over the place
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had that problem last night too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were falling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was tying little strings from the
corners to the plants and trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them to stay up and they were still.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's a good problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Means they're getting heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I've had branches like snap too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snap completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to harvest at that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pretty, pretty clean snap too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, you could try to tape
it up, but this one wasn't, wasn't able to
[SPEAKER_01]: recover at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know lighting is a huge one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with these new grow lights,
people are burning their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't know what the correct light
distance is with the dimmer and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you come across any problems with
lighting and like light distance and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trial and error.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was learning where to put my light
because like I said, I'm still rocking the
[SPEAKER_00]: CMH so I don't have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going by measuring how far it
is and just looking at how the plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: responding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're looking a little bit droopy or
they're looking a little stressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's time to raise the light a bit or just
either start the stretch or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: time to lower the light a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's easier in that sense
growing with HID, whether it be HPS,
[SPEAKER_01]: MH or CMH.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like distance because it's pretty,
pretty standard in a sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like was it 12 to 14 inches for flowering,
18 to 20 inches, 24 to 36 inches for
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty standard, you know,
it's LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you got to worry about the dimmer
if you want to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the distance on top of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually have a whole video on kind
of how to determine light distance using
[SPEAKER_01]: the dimmer on your grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you guys want to check that out on
my channel, just search for it and you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: find it and gives you some additional tips
on what you can do to dial in that light
[SPEAKER_01]: distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was just going to say, I will be
having those kinds of problems because I
[SPEAKER_00]: am upgrading my lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soon enough, you'll face it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light burning is like just the number one
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are just putting their grow
lights too close, too high of intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it looks like other,
it looks like other issues too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it looks like calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people mistaken for really it's
just, you're, you're burning your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see the rust spotting, you know,
on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll kind of see that only kind of be a
different pattern with the light burn,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you'll notice it more on the top part
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also, you notice like more yellow
margins on the leaves and like the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: will potentially start curling,
you know, up or down like burnt looking
[SPEAKER_01]: burnt in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of how you know you have light
burn versus calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any problems with pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: The only biggest problem I've had so far,
knock on wood, because I know it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to come, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only problem I've had is with
fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I use for IPN is a, like I said,
I use a diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I like to do on that, whether they're
just the top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen guys put it right all over their
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's the right way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you apply the diatomaceous earth
on that medium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I amended it when I first amended
my cell when I was first starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I transplanted, I did it
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably when I top dress, I might do
it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus gnats is something I battle with as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once in a while, I feel like
those are one of the easiest pests to get
[SPEAKER_01]: rid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, number one, yellow sticky traps is
what I usually use and have those by the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of see if you have the
problem, you know, and then letting the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium dry out is another way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, particularly with the synthetic
nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you can have the medium kind of dry
out and then the fungus gnats go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my experience is sometimes you need to
let the medium dry out multiple times
[SPEAKER_01]: before they truly go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you've got the eggs hatching down
there and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you're with organics,
you know, people would argue that you
[SPEAKER_01]: should never have the medium dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're in a desperate
situation to where you've got an
[SPEAKER_01]: infestation of fungus gnats and they're
destroying your plant, well, then you
[SPEAKER_01]: might want to, you know, last,
last ditch effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might want to let that medium dry out
or do the diatomaceous earth like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you do, which I haven't used myself
by heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend it for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other problems with pests at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've been growing for about three
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you said three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's been about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one time I thought I had spider
mites, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just being foolish.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a mold from a mushroom,
mycelium, sorry, mycelium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, everybody's like, no,
no, that's not fungus or it's not spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just mycelium.
Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any problems with harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you usually do for harvesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvesting, I, I usually chop my plant
down a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do individual branches and I hang
it up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just this past growth is when I first
started, I started using, I hang it in my
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I found that gave me a lot more
control over my environment that way
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of hanging it in a utility closet,
you know, no fans, no humidifier or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a good dry out of it the last
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably got like 14 days, a good two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was quite pleased with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, it's just after that,
then I do individual branches of just
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trim with the scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any fancy machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the old fashioned trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I enjoy trim jail just like everybody
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a common problem with harvesting
is folks don't know when to harvest or
[SPEAKER_01]: they harvest too early.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, investing in that
microscope to see the color of the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes is definitely a beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now most of the time, a lot of folks
have good smartphones where you can take a
[SPEAKER_01]: close up picture of the plant,
of the bud, and then zoom into that
[SPEAKER_01]: picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: To see the color of the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can do that on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the Pixel 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: My roommate has a Samsung.
[SPEAKER_01]: His actually, I think looks better than
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Apple iPhone is stellar camera on
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people don't even need the
microscope anymore, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Samsung and it has an incredible
camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microscopes are about to be obsolete
when it comes to checking the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: soon, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But knowing when to harvest, I mean,
you know, the color of the trichomes is
[SPEAKER_01]: something that people look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly cloudy is what I aim for.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, there is some amber in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people look for a certain percentage
of amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really go by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think when the trichomes are
mostly cloudy, there might be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 10% amber or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it really comes down to personal
preference on when you want to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's generally what I look,
I look about for 80 to 20, 80% to 20%,
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you just have to, like you said
before, sometimes you just have to harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter what the trichomes look
like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know you touched a little bit on
drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dive a little bit deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dry environment, I know I use a grow
tent mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've dried in closets before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've dried in bathrooms before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dried in regular bedrooms before.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to have that proper
temperature and humidity during drying as
[SPEAKER_01]: well is arguably just as important,
if not more important than the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidity when you're growing the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you aim for, for temperature and
humidity when drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with the 60-60 method.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% humidity, 60-10.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I got it the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was probably the best harvest I've had.
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more people go into the 60-60
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I generally do 55 to 60% RH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I try to get down to 60,
you know, room temperature around 70
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees Fahrenheit is acceptable for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One could argue against that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One could argue against 60 degrees versus
70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we know terpenes evaporate at
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one could argue that, hey, if you're
drying at 70 degrees, well then some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those terpenes are evaporating versus,
you know, 60 degrees, you're having less
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been finding myself trying to get
the temp lower and lower to achieve that
[SPEAKER_01]: 60, but I don't really beat myself up,
you know, from around 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start to panic a little bit when I'm at
like over 75.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, then I'm like, oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really should be taking actions in order
to try to get that temperature down
[SPEAKER_01]: because again, terpenes are evaporating at
different temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just losing it and that smell and
the flavor as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then making sure there's air exchange
in the environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So air should be exchanged, shouldn't be
stagnant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you mentioned that you have a fan
in there to kind of make sure air is
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can easily, if you have stagnant air
in there, you could easily get mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, especially if you're running 60%
RH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that plus stagnant air,
that's a recipe of a disaster right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened to me before, you know,
accidentally, but making sure there's
[SPEAKER_01]: certain exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I usually dry in a grow tent and
sometimes I'll keep that grow tent cracked
[SPEAKER_01]: open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, you know, there is some
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure it's dark as well,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Light shouldn't be shining on your plants
while they're drying because light
[SPEAKER_01]: degrades those trichomes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my tent, my four by four is kind of
one of those knockoff ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do have light leaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a blanket over it to block it
because I only have one door entrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put a blanket right over it to block
it where the zippers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seemed to help last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about curing, last but not least?
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing, another thing that I feel is
overlooked often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any problems with curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just only problems just from
learning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not because I had any major issues,
but I do the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the burping twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a week and then down to once a day for
another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I might still burp
once here and there, but then you just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of start just letting them sit and
be, just let them cure for as long as you
[SPEAKER_00]: can without smoking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very important to make sure
that it's just the humidity is not too
[SPEAKER_01]: much in the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I highly recommend buying,
spending the money to get hygrometers,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a 12 pack of those little
hygrometers, the digital ones that fit in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're like probably 20 bucks or
something like that for a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly recommend you get that and monitor
that because if the humidity is too high
[SPEAKER_01]: in the container, mold, mold occurs,
you know, and you've ruined your harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spending the $20 on the hygrometers for
your jars, I think is a must in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I got them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use those as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what other advice do you have for
growers who are just getting started with
[SPEAKER_01]: growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would say is, first of all,
be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to make lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just don't freak out if things aren't
going right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most people start growing and
they're following somebody on YouTube,
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of content creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, reach out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them have discords or even just on
the videos themselves in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like just reach out to them and ask them
the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not too many that don't want to
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically why we're all here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to help other people learn how to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, most definitely just be patient
and don't be afraid to ask for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just research, read, research,
watch, and get a mentor if you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always helpful to have somebody to
show you what to do and how to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: because learning on your own, it's fun,
but you make a lot of mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on a lot of good good pieces
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everybody can find me obviously on
YouTube as the rookie grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on Instagram as the underscore rookie
grower, all underscore or sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: all lowercase letters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also on Twitter, the rookie
grower, all capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: So besides that, what do I have currently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on, it's called my chaotic run
and it's a, I'm showcasing a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a few of them coming up where I'm
showcasing their cultivars on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just doing, I just totally
dedicated to their cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got two more after this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, well, it's on to
bigger and better things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grow It exclusive, I'm expanding my
grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I will provide a link to the rookie
