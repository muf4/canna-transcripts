[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back and I'm joined with Keys.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all over YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a million different YouTube
channels, it seems like.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your hand in a whole bunch of
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I think you're most known for is,
at least I most know you for, is the
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've grown so much over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really cool to see you develop
and seeing you actually go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic way of gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And today we're going to get into that
organic water only method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that I know you've had great
success with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been showing it recently on your
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to let you tell us all about the
details here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you give us a little bit of
an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Dwayne Keys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows me as Basedrop Keys,
your friendly neighborhood Negro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody thinks that's always funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just kept it because I need something
to stand out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raised in Georgia.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a military vet.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I got out of the army, I basically
stayed where I was at rather than going
[SPEAKER_00]: back home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just by happenstance,
I just got in my head, I want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: content creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to watch a guy, Custom Grow 420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't watched him in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh, Custom Grow 420,
YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to love that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but I started being a content creator
for 20, 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started actually growing October
2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been growing almost four years
next month, the before years that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the organic side,
I'm really leaning towards it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is probably easier,
a lot easier for people to do because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to do the nutrients every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually how I found you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a video where you were doing
showing blue planet nutrients and you were
[SPEAKER_00]: showing, you know, what water you should
put it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I actually found out about you
whenever I started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you helped me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I first started, you was losing,
you was using a blackstrap molasses and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really appreciate that when I was
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your book on Amazon, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really helped me when I started,
but I really lean towards organic because
[SPEAKER_00]: from Mr. Knuts grow, he calls it the lazy
man way of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's really efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: The organic way, because you only have to
do the drive amendments every three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed if you're doing synthetic,
then you know, every time you feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, some people do feed water,
feed water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I'm doing synthetic, I'm usually
doing feed every time, unless the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: tells me otherwise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every time you do it, then you have to
do the nutrients and pH and all the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So organic kind of lean towards me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus I'm an auto pot grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I seen your interview with autopotamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an auto pot grower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: For what I do, it just really just leans
towards a better grow and easier for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with a whole bunch of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your overall growth style, you'd say
now you're more organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were synthetic before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also are you in soil or cocoa or
hydroponic system?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never grown outdoor yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Mendo dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have those big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yo, I want to do that too,
but I haven't got there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of mine are indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I love cocoa and perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually love the Mother Earth 7030 bag
cocoa perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my favorite one to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have been growing with soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the ones that I just did recently,
they were all with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that so that people can see that
with auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that you can only do
cocoa with auto pots, but you can also do
[SPEAKER_00]: soil as well as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to show that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plus I wanted to show the different
setups that auto pot has that they even
[SPEAKER_00]: gave my own setup, the base drop keys auto
pot system, which I appreciate auto pot
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I wanted to show that you could,
with auto parts, you can still do soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I prefer cocoa and perlite,
the Mother Earth cocoa and perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're fully in the auto pot
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not in like individual containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think auto pots has a couple different
size containers that are in their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mine, the normal one is the 3.9 gallon
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they get the base drop key system,
then it's going to be the 3.9 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just recently I've been using the
double XL system.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in a nine gallon, a 13 gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did the nine gallon ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the two XL system,
they have the 6.6 gallon plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use those as well because I had a
five by five, two five, two five by five
[SPEAKER_00]: tenths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put two of those in each of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I wanted to use the 6.6
gallons as opposed to the 3.9 gallon that
[SPEAKER_00]: I would normally use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm only doing a limited amount of
plants, but they have nine gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 gallon, 6.6 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the regular one is 3.9 gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have the 3.9 gallon ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jeez.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to have been four or five years ago
now and a great system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really good system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked in podcast episodes in the
past kind of about the system and how it
[SPEAKER_01]: works and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we won't really get into any of that,
but I do want to know really your water
[SPEAKER_01]: only style.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned you soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you've been doing for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular bag to soil that you
use or is it a custom mix that you create?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's in your mix to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super simple Fox farm ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used it so many times now that I know
that you can get at least 30 to 35 days
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to put any more nutrients
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox farm ocean forest is the base for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used a build a soil before too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a good grow with that one,
but the most up I've used this Fox farm
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the base of the soil whenever I
use soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that it's amendments every
three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like it's really a bad rep.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get a lot of people that
have mentioned, Oh, they're too strong for
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings and they're going to burn your
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your, what's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the, all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just read a comment like 20 minutes
before we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said that you didn't burn up your
seedlings with the Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys, you can, you can check it out right
on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seedlings go right into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing anything special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to do the napkin method germination
style, you know, with the bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, but just putting it right into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know where it ever in it too
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had an issue with it one time
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure where that came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use Fox farm ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've used it for 14 years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I might've seen that in one of
your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to tell you when I first
started, it was a big resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still watch your videos now,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I first, when you first start,
that's when you need a majority of your
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have the same experience with you
where I, I don't really see that burnt
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I've ever, I've had like one
plant struggle in that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a sour diesel, which is
notorious for being finicky when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to the growth, nutrient uptake and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, I think I'm going to do a
whole video on does Fox farm ocean forest
[SPEAKER_01]: soil burns seedlings and not just show
people my result.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had one issue with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one time that I did though,
it wasn't, it was my fault because I put
[SPEAKER_00]: more amendments in it from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I found out you don't need
any more amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already has nutrients in it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the one time it was my fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people make mistakes and then try to
blame the breeder, the company,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil company, everybody but
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I messed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You started with Fox farm ocean forest
soil and not adding any additional
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point do you add in amendments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause eventually that's going to deplete,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you say the 30, 40 day mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, from me using it, just, you know,
just by experience, because I've only been
[SPEAKER_00]: growing next month is going to be four
years that I've been growing, but already
[SPEAKER_00]: have over 50 harvest under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing 10, 12, 15 at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how on my channel, the seed to
harvest videos, which people usually know
[SPEAKER_00]: me by as far as that channel, there's
already like 38 seed to harvest videos on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus I obviously I haven't courted every
girl that I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in four years I've done over 50 grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that I do it is straight out
of the bag box farm ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when I'm using the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the calendar, I just,
on day 28, we're doing dry amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I'm using down to earth dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people like guy agreeing
Mr. I never heard of guy green until Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I wanted to get guy green,
it wasn't available in the U S it is now,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I use down to earth and weren't worm
castings or four, four, four, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, four during bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super simple suit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in the army and we have a method
in the army called kiss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's really keep it simple,
stupid, but you know, people on PC,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't say stupid now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soldier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the point of that is the minimum that
you can do to get the job done and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: great result.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to be as efficient as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So arm castings, all purpose vegetable
garden, that'll be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get to a flower,
add the four, eight, four in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super and order.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of people here that tune in
and they take notes and they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: emulate what some of the guests do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us specifics on how much down
to earth four, four, four, you're giving
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and worm castings on the first
feeding versus the second feeding and so
[SPEAKER_01]: on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it really depends on which part I'm
using because either I'm using a three
[SPEAKER_00]: point nine or the six point six usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just recently I said I did those nine
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's my first time using like the big
nine gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even changing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings, one cup of vegetable
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's if it's a three point nine gallon,
I'll do half a cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's six point six, a full cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the nine or above, I was doing a
little bit over a cup out of a cup and a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't change it every I do it every
four weeks unless sometimes, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the yellow and starts coming in
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can obviously see that they're
going to need some food before it's time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I might do a week early.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I try to do every four weeks,
but sometimes it's every three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even change it throughout the
next time that I it's usually only going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be two times.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because the first 30 days are good to
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next 28 days, you're going to be
getting ready for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to do it one time in
the flower because usually eight weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine weeks, 10 weeks or somewhere in that
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll do a one time in flower as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: One cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a cup, if it's three point nine,
one cup, if it's six point six,
[SPEAKER_00]: one and a quarter, if it's a bigger pot
than that, super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the four, four, four, you're only
using when the plants are in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you go to flower,
you're sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking out the four before four.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, eight, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's where I'm casting is one cup,
four, eight, four, four, four,
[SPEAKER_00]: four vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I add four, eight, four,
whenever it's in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just flower only is when I used to four.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, is that the top dressing right before
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do because I'm not going to say
usually, but lately I've been doing two
[SPEAKER_00]: months of veg for the first 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got covered by what's in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I do the dry members, then they go
another month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do the dry members whenever I do the
dry members this time, whenever I flip
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I add the four, eight,
four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they get one more time in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four, eight, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, usually it's eight
weeks, nine weeks, 10 weeks until you are
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had some auto flowers that went
11 or 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, those long flower ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really get into hot water,
especially if you think you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: like an eight week or a nine week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden you get to like week
six, seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, this isn't starting to ripen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of a sudden you're at week
10, 11, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh, I should have done
another feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My biggest harvest so far out of all those
harvests I told you about is actually an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flower fast buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, West Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gee, fast buds was my biggest harvest
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, it's auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the first time I ever
experienced bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never had buds big enough to have to
worry about it till then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the big I was like, goodness,
he's auto flowers are strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not like the old auto flowers
where people were talking trash about
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, it was totally different
when didn't yield as much as photos could,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, nowadays that's a whole
different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So auto flowers are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of them are really amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm going to do auto flowers for
my next runs because a couple of companies
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind enough to send me some,
some seeds, my fist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you talked about my fist on here
before and a fast, but I got some seats
[SPEAKER_00]: for fast, but shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking I'm going to do some auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that feeding regimen that you
mentioned, do you ever have plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't like it and you see
deficiencies or is every plant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: give that regimen to healthy throughout
the whole grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people watch my content, then they know
I showed the good, the bad, if it,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it happens, I show it just because it's
a bad growing, you're going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, that, I wish that was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, I almost went off on a tangent,
but we're going to keep it great.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, on my, um, or some of the plants,
some of these plants are stubborn and then
[SPEAKER_00]: can't treat every plant the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of them need some extra love
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's frustrating because you're
doing everything that you think that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can do, but it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know some of the times you talk
about a BPD and EC and that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't ever check that until there's a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, why everything's healthy,
whatever the growth going fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't worry about BPD or EC or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as it starts being problems,
then I start really trying to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's really just pH that
I worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I do have problems, for the most
part, I've been lucky because it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lack of calcium, you know,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they do have organic cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My organic grows TPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make some great organic cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the most part, that's usually what
it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because whenever you use dry amendments,
for you guys that don't know, dry
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments are not like synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you put synthetic in your water,
the plant can uptake it right then and
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: With dry amendments, they have to break
down first.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes, especially if you catch a
deficiency late, you put your dry minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you did that and your water from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You remember, I'm using auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wicking system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whenever you do dry amendments in it,
you need to water from the top to help the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while you're doing the three or four
days, it can get kind of worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so sometimes I'll go ahead and just
use that organic cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is readily available to the plants
and it can uptake it a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really how what helped me a lot
is that organic cow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a powdered form or liquid?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you know the application rate for
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's made by TPS and it's a liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can do it just like if you were
doing your synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, using auto pots, you know,
we have a reservoir and so you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: put it right in your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's readily up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the plants can uptake it so
fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was like a dry powder or dry
amendment, you know, it'd take a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's soluble bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant can uptake it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the plants will take that
feeding regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, others may struggle
and you'll utilize cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about compost teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing that people use when
they're growing organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they kind of want to have a little
boost to the microbial population,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, and help with the abandonment
breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you utilize compost teas at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got that idea from Mr. Knuts
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think anybody that does what we do,
don't watch him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hasn't put out a video in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope he's coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But compost teas are super simple to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use an air pump and I'm using all for my
entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that makes a difference to
a lot of you guys, but I don't use the tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't done that in a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is because the tap water,
there's other things in it besides water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I rather have reverse osmosis water that's
already filtered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, if you want to be doing
synthetic and you can add whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to add to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I'm not adding anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just want the water itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I'm going off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the question again?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was about compost teas, if you can
break down how you do them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost teas, the simple recipe is worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also need some type of sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I told you, you use blackstrap
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my sugar that I use for the
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have used a little bone meal in
there before, but or alfalfa I've used
[SPEAKER_00]: before as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually the compost tea and the
blackstrap molasses, you can get away with
[SPEAKER_00]: just that by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in, you can make compost teas
for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make compost teas for flour,
depending on where you are in the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use that same four, four,
four, four, eight, four down to earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: guy green, whatever dry amendments you
guys are using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use the same dry amendments and
worm castings to make your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just need a bucket air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing like a five gallon bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's so great about compost teas is
you can really spread it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put them in other buckets and then
thin them out and use them because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: super strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You order it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing a lot of plants like I
used to do, I had 15, 16 tents in one
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you can't do, but so many five
gallon buckets, so you can actually thin
[SPEAKER_00]: it out and you can a little bit goes a
long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost teas is it usually do what you
fill up the five gallon bucket,
[SPEAKER_01]: like almost all the way about four gallons
worth and then put, what is it one cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process that I do is I fill up the
five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to leave a little space on the
top because whenever the air pump starts
[SPEAKER_00]: going, it's going to start bubbling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave a little bit of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they have these little spaces,
like a strainer bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I pour the worm castings
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually one cup of worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm doing it for veg, then it's going
to be one cup of the, the four,
[SPEAKER_00]: four, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the black strap
molasses, maybe four or five, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: away with four or five tablespoons,
but honestly guys, I'm putting like a
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter cup in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pour it in there and stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after you do that, you put your,
your air pump in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the air pump with four lines,
but one line is just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it on high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just cover it with a towel
because you know, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: bubbling from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you guys are going to see
is that you're going to see us a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: foam on the top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's actually what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you know, everything's breaking
down as it should.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after 24 hours, you're good to go
and you can feed it to your plants.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how about microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will buy those and use them,
or they'll do like the IMO process and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually get their own microbes out of the
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use microbial inoculants at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not one bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, I'm super efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might call it lazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it super efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the reason I do the things
that I do is because like I was telling
[SPEAKER_00]: you, whenever I first started growing,
I started, I'm right now I'm in New Mexico
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Texas, New Mexico and Mexico
border.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved to LA during the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I started, I moved to LA
April 1st, 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started growing October,
2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had six tents in a studio apartment,
well, one bedroom apartment, smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: studio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whenever I started growing,
I'm doing everything myself, filming
[SPEAKER_00]: everything myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got so many girls going that I can't
spend a lot of time with each individual
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you, when you're struggling
to make ends meet and then you find out
[SPEAKER_00]: that, Hey, these companies will pay you to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more girls you do, the more money you
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also I'm trying to fast forward
my education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, when I started this, still now I
don't, I didn't have anybody in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't know anybody that's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided that I wanted to do it and
I just started doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's nothing that can beat
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have friends and whatnot that's
been growing 20 years, 15 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: can't beat experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did I do to fast forward my
experience?
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of doing one grow, I'll do six
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I've been able to fast forward
my experience because I have friends that
[SPEAKER_00]: they grow outside, like traditional,
not light depths, traditional one harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: a year grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be growing 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've had 20 harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had over 50 harvest because I'm able
to fast forward my education.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that, I'm trying to be as
efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I found auto pots because I'm
doing everything myself and thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 15 tents in a house and you're
hand watering everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some, some things need to be watered once
a day, twice a day, sometimes depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: how you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm using cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know about the runoff and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to have a shop vac.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to be as efficient as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I microbes, I never used them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of these microbes are actually
going to come in on your amendments and
[SPEAKER_01]: worm castings and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that and CO2, I don't use CO2
or anything like that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: No CO2 for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned use RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use RO water as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have one of those under the sink?
[SPEAKER_01]: Units or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one under the sink unit,
but I have, uh, I usually do it to the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's outside, you know, it plugs into
the one outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got spent like a hundred bucks from
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best money I spent because if you guys
don't know, whenever you're trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started on synthetic nutrients,
nutrients, blue planet nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got that from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when, whenever you're trying
to put your amendments or your amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: your nutrients inside some tap water,
whatever the case is, your EC is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be too high because it's already stuff in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to strip it down to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a good base and then you can
build from there, put what you want in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I started using first loss,
most of the water and I just continue
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of that water, you know,
if it has a high PPM, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: of using tap water, you don't know what's
in there unless you get a water test,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or look at the water report that comes
from your local water municipal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one thing I found, I can't use my
tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 485 PPM, very high in sodium by
carbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really makes the pH very high and it's
just not really suitable for growing my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to use an auto system as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been under the zinc one and,
uh, yeah, it works out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I totally, totally get what you mean by
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do you go about your watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that it's obviously it's an
auto pot system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to wick up from the bottom,
but you also mentioned that sometimes you
[SPEAKER_01]: do a top watering in order to try to keep
those amendments more moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you walk us through like when you
would go about doing that, how much water
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only time that I do top watering is
during the dry minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we're going to be amending our
dry minutes, the next three or four days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to come in and I'm just going to
take, I have a little watering can I use
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the reservoir for the auto pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the 11 gallon a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I have a little watering can that
fits in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's probably about four cups,
five cups of water, not that much,
[SPEAKER_00]: because even though the autopot system,
it wicks from the bottom and has a base,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can overflood the base if you put too
much in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just, whenever I'm doing the dry
minutes, the next three or four days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm watering from the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's wicked from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said you do monitor the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you monitoring the pH that you put in
your reservoir, for example, and what do
[SPEAKER_01]: you typically aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, if I'm in, uh, it depends on
if I'm doing cocoa or soil, usually when
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing soil, the pH is higher than
cocoa, cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go 5.5, 6.5 from doing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm really in that maybe six to seven
range, as long as it's in the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I never try to get it very
special.
[SPEAKER_00]: I write on 6.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to be arranged because to me,
I feel like what we're trying to do inside
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically replicate what's happening
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so outside they never get just a
constant 6.6, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just make sure I have it in between
6.7 or 5.5 to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I just, if it's around six,
no matter if it's cocoa or soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pretty much good to go somewhere in
that sixth area.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned soil and cocoa and correct
me if I'm wrong, but the soil would be for
[SPEAKER_01]: the water only style that you're doing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cocoa is for the synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also I have done organic and cocoa as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just treat it the same way,
except for the mother earth, cocoa and
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start with the 730 bag and then you just
do your own dry amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you same thing, worm castings,
four, four, four, four, four, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact dry amendments that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the same thing, except whenever you
start off, you're going to put your dry
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments in there because you don't have
those first 30 days of nutrients that's
[SPEAKER_00]: already in the Fox farm bag already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously you don't have that with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to give them some nutrients,
but I've done it both ways as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you are using cocoa only
with the water only method and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing those initial amendments,
are you letting that cocoa sit for a while
[SPEAKER_01]: before you plant something into it or are
you planting into it right away?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually see a lot of videos from expert
growers that they do that and let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a rookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I mix it and put it in the bucket
and we're off and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never let it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the time or the room to let
it sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I'm a rookie.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a real home grower, so we're doing
this in apartments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have a house thanks to everybody
supporting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you on internet, but I'm in a studio
apartment, one bedroom apartment,
[SPEAKER_00]: then rented a house, now bought a house.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the time resources for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mix it all together, put it in the
bucket, put it in the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're off and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: No waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Has there ever been problems doing that,
specifically the cocoa route and
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments planting right into it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear people say it's like, just like
the, the whole seedling Fox farm is too
[SPEAKER_00]: hot on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can find plenty of videos and articles
saying that, but I've never had an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of misinformation on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't believe everything that I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, at some point you don't know
what's real science was bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started growing, I was doing
the two days of darkness before I did the
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do that anymore, but I saw Mr.
Canucks do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw some other people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, Oh, this is what we're supposed
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's like, this is bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was like, doesn't make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I started doing it without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a big difference here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't, I just stopped doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might actually do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't do it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, at first it was that it's going to
help with the ripening of trichomes and
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes are formed at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a last ditch effort to get more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, I want to say kind of
debunked, but I, I actually asked Dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bruce Bugley that and he says,
trichomes are formed during the day and on
[SPEAKER_01]: a night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that kind of makes that null and void.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's other folks that reply
and say, well, it's actually the breakdown
[SPEAKER_01]: of the starches and sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are throwing out additional
potential balance benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think we've really,
there's been enough studies out there to
[SPEAKER_01]: really prove one way or another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that I'm like, I don't think
just for me with my own plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a difference, but you know,
all growers have, they have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: superstitions and things, ways that allow
you to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to say, if you think it makes a
difference and your plants are fire,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not broke, don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, myself, I'm going to move on to the
next thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pH EC and PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned you only check that when
there is a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you looking for when you check
it, when there's a problem, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: know there's a problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: On one of the grows that I did gorilla
glue, if you guys looked, it was the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I found my second favorite strain of all
time is gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine gave me some beautiful
gorilla glue and I found two seeds in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had an epiphany.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, Hey, I'm a grower now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if I can grow from this bag seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually planted it, grew it out,
cloned it, and I filled up a whole four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four tent with this gorilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those plants actually, I never
experienced it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never even, I heard people say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even heard you say on one of the videos,
if you don't do this the right way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get nutrient lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this plant, it just stopped uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't uptake anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it may be, it needed a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it out, flushed it all out,
put it back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing helped it ended up whenever
something like that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just something just out of the
ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I've done 50 harvest at this
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many plants I've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of plants, but you see a lot of
plants and you know, from doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times the cycle that they should
be taken plan is in week four,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you start noticing, or one of the
plants starts lagging behind the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just notice something out of the
ordinary, that's when I start checking EC,
[SPEAKER_00]: checking my VPD, which I, thanks to AC
infinity is real easy to check your VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I needed a meter, I can't get a
meter or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to AC infinity, they make it
real easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's just right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's when you start checking my VPD,
EC, PPMs, everything, just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out is anything out of the
ordinary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You start flushing the plant, checking the
runoff should be checking the PPMs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff as opposed to what you put in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that I've seen from your
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You showed me how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, I'm a, I want to be an
expert grower at some point, but right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, I feel like I'm still experimenting,
trying to find what's great for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this organic with the autopots has
really been working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to keep going down this route.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, when things starts going
wrong, I'm just researching like everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about things that's happened in
the past, you know, sometimes things
[SPEAKER_00]: repeat themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just notice anything out of the
ordinary, that's when I start talking,
[SPEAKER_00]: checking all the data points that I can
think to check something's out of whack
[SPEAKER_00]: and we got to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just do the best that you can
basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of us are learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single one of us are still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you've been growing for 30,
40 years, new information is coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still learn about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so crazy, so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll never be an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I, I thrive to be, I strive,
thrive, strive to be one, one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing that makes it fun though,
is being able to just learn, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an endless amount of things you can
learn and experiment with really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't learn a lot when everything is
going great every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust, you know, channels,
channels in our niche and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I watch all your videos and every video
has been 100% great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've never had powdery mildew,
never had, never had passed before spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: My three never had nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's been great the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't trust you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see something went wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point, some of these channels,
everything's been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, okay, I don't watch you anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be pretty clear that some people
are hiding their problems, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: content creators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I'm just like you, where I show my
problems and it kind of sucks because
[SPEAKER_01]: people just hate on you because you have
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're a cowgirl grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're coming across this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just thinking, I'm like,
nah, everybody has problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can't go your entire career and
not have any problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be a newbie.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your first second year and have
healthy plants the whole way, but
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually you're going to come across
some sort of pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually you're going to come across a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually you're going to come across
some sort of problem in the growth space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think you really, if you're a
content creator, I don't think you should
[SPEAKER_01]: hide that from people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like show, because that's a learning
experience that other people can learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first year as a content creator,
I did this the craziest thing I wish I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't have did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing these different videos,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I mess up, I would just delete it
and start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mess up is the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't learn that until you're
like, no, that's what people need to see
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever, whenever you guys are growing
and you mess up, you shouldn't be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, every time I watch keys, he's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's not reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's going to mess up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learn from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to do better the next time.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't have said it better myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into environment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you already mentioned that you don't
supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned you really don't look too
deep into VPD, although it's on the
[SPEAKER_01]: controller now for AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do kind of keep your eye on it a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how about the temperature and relative
humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically aim for for the
different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you know, as you go further along in
the grow, your RH is going to be coming
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you are, she's going to be
coming down because if you got a hard H a
[SPEAKER_00]: high RH and you're at the end of the
flower, then you're really, really taking
[SPEAKER_00]: a chance on but right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found out that the hard way when I
had the 16, 15, 15 tents in the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: all in flower at the same time,
it's so much humidity inside the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: The walls are sweating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when I had that problem with
but right that I was telling you about the
[SPEAKER_00]: big buds with too much humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but that's your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever for you guys to start off growing
your seedlings, they love high humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you go further along in the grow,
when you get to the end of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes you're going to be probably
around 50 or 40 as far as your RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now your temperature, my temperature,
because I'm using my central air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner to help me regulate inside
bedrooms that I'm growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so usually I'm keeping it around 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we get in the flower,
I am bringing it down to around 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that area, so 65 to 70 is usually where
I met the entire row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people like that 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little, a little bit hotter temperature
for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really in that 65 to at the highest
that they'll ever be is like 74.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as temperature and the humidity,
like I said, it's going to start off high
[SPEAKER_00]: as the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you can go from 99% as a
ceiling to 40, 45% whenever you're ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest them.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you use for grow lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you aim for a specific amount of
par during the different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Never checked part of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never going to tell you don't have a,
I know, obviously I know what par is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's par meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I know about par, but I've never
checked par in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am, I've been very lucky as for
congestion about grow lights, every grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've done that you guys can look at
every one of them has been sponsored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first, my very first grows thanks to
he was actually there at the ACE infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: says Troy, thanks to my buddy Troy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great, great guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He got me my first growing sponsors,
Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sponsored my first two grows
just because Troy, I told you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started as a content creator for 20,
2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't start growing to 2020,
but in those four years I got pretty big
[SPEAKER_00]: as the do you dab guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a group on Facebook with like over
75,000 people in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just had a big community called do
you dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so because of that Troy told Mars
Hydro, Hey, he hasn't grown anything yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you should sponsor him because he's
going to be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just off of Troy's word, they actually
did sponsor me my first two grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, that's when ACE
infinity found me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, so as far as the lights,
Mars Hydro, spider farmer, but ACE
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity is near and dear to my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's the first growing sponsor
that I got by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had only been growing six months and as
if I did a, um, I watched Mr. Knuts grow
[SPEAKER_00]: video and he did a video on the T four
inline fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I was thinking if I could have a fan
that would turn on and off by itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: like with parameters, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I watched his video and I'm like,
I just thought of that somebody made what
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use Mr. Knuts code, got it off for
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And made a video with it that wasn't
sponsored, obviously, but it's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The day that that video hit 100,000 views,
I got an email from ACE infinity saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we've seen your video.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think you've got a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to be sponsored by us?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, hell yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been good ever since the past three
years, three and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ACE infinity is my favorite light
company, but I do work with, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars hydro spider farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sponsored by every, every major
light intent manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sponsored by every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I told you my coming in,
I wanted to make this a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as soon as I started as a content
creator, I'm trying to figure out how can
[SPEAKER_00]: I get paid to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I started growing and people
seem to take a liking to how I explain
[SPEAKER_00]: things and my voice is funny and the way I
talk is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they keep, but people seem to like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the, no, the sponsor started hitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started working with ACE infinity,
I kind of like open up the flood gates for
[SPEAKER_00]: you name them and you can use my name on
their website and get a discount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the AC infinity lights as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got the Evo three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two of those Evo six now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also got their older mom and say
older lights, but they're the halo style
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that they call with the opening in
the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got those two 22 and two 24s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are, they all rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all do really, really good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, since you said you're not measuring
par, how do you determine the light
[SPEAKER_01]: distance and the amount to dim the light
down to?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, I use the manufacturer's
recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, all lights come with the
manufacturer's recommendations and you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys really should think about these,
these companies, they put a lot of money
[SPEAKER_00]: into R and D research and development and
they know what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing about, I don't know if you were
going to ask about, you know, when are we
[SPEAKER_00]: going to harvest the plants and that type
of deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with these breeders
who are breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're a good breeder, then they have
a recommendation on about when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: expect to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use that along with looking at the
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like manufacturers, if they say 18 inches
above the canopy at 40%, then that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously from experience,
you go up a little bit, go down a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, but everybody starting off light
manufacturers, the recommendation,
[SPEAKER_00]: they really do put a lot of effort into
telling you the right information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you run for light cycles
for veg and flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'm, I'm 24 and during the,
uh, sealant stage, I'm 24 hours on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I transplant out of,
you know, I'm red solo cup old school with
[SPEAKER_00]: it, red solos cup until I transplant into
whatever pot I'm going to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I transplant them into the veg
pot, if you will, my veg auto pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's when I do 18 and six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I hit flower 12 and 12,
I have done 24 hours for the entire veg
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, the plants don't need a
dark period until flower, if they're photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have done that before, but I just
found that that just makes your light bill
[SPEAKER_00]: go higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might as well just actually I've
done 18 and six from the beginning too,
[SPEAKER_00]: but usually I'm 24 hours on for the first,
probably like 10 days or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one thing I just want to clarify
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some people listening in
and they're like, why is he talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: climate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is he talking about lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought this was the organic water only
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are these things being talked about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to clarify that the
variables, they're variables that you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to factor in when you are determining how
much nutrition you put into the medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think it's only about the
nutrition, how much nutrition is going
[SPEAKER_01]: into the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're running higher temps,
then keys, if you're running CO2 and keys,
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't running CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you could have to maybe feed
more, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your plant is metabolizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working a little bit harder,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are things to take into
consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I ask him these questions about
climate, about lighting and so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wanted to clarify on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you guys take this for somebody
who's not, I've been growing that long,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've been able to get some people
like, yo, you growing high times magazine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Type of stuff in your bedroom,
which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to tell you guys these
individual little points make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think that the water and the light,
um, how far the light is from the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the quality that you get,
you're going to get as far as the density
[SPEAKER_00]: of your book, your, your, your buds,
it does make a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these little things that he's
talking about, they really add up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes a, the difference
between a okay grower and a great grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The attention, the detail that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even somebody like me that does
everything very efficient, you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that your environment,
first thing is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't talk about that, but it's going
to be very hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't start with good genetics,
I don't care how much of a great grower
[SPEAKER_00]: you are bad in equals bad out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't start with trash and
think you're going to get treasure out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing is genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, that's when it comes to the
grower with the temperature, with
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, with your water, everything that
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you guys that's doing par and EC and
PPM, whatever it is that you're using to
[SPEAKER_00]: get where you want to get to genetics
first, and then your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's going to give you good,
good buds, good, whatever you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, zucchini, whatever you're
growing mushrooms, whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, but attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many misconceptions when it
come to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say are some misconceptions
about the organic water only method?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things that I hear the
most is some people don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: organic because somehow they think that
it's harder than synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be for some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I find it easier because you don't
have to do the nutrient ritual that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do every time that you feed,
depending on if you do feed every time
[SPEAKER_00]: like we're talking about or feed,
whatever feed, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to me, it's just the easiest way to do
it because you're only going to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: your dry minutes every three or four
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, all you're doing is
putting your water if you're hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering, obviously you hand one every
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, if you're using a
reservoir, you just fill up your reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: once a week or once every eight,
nine days, depending on how big your
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the biggest misconception is
that it's harder than synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one is some people think for
whatever reason that you don't get great
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes unless you use like synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the case at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: With organic, you're going to get great
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, they think that you're
not going to be in like a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, when I told them I was going
to grow organic, some people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, why would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just use synthetic newts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, but why do you think that's
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why some people think that
growing with synthetically is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to get a better result than
growing organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what you put into it,
so you know what's coming out of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't understand why some people
feel, but you know, this is the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: age and you heard it on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like he's welcoming debates in
the comment section.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would approve him wrong?
[SPEAKER_01]: Comment below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the Athena?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few more questions here for you
beginners, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: That are just getting started with this
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for the beginners
that are just getting started doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: water only organic method?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the main thing is just try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try it one time and see if you like
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're somebody who was very busy,
cause there's a lot of people that's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing as a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got work and you got kids
and you got your daily life that you got
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that organic is something that
would really work for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you, I'm going to be honest with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of times because I have a
bunch of different channels and the bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: that you get, the more opportunities that
you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm doing a lot of different things
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's some times where if you
guys follow my videos, then you know that
[SPEAKER_00]: I update you every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, when you watch my videos,
you see, you know, day seven veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: day 14 veg, day 21 veg, sometimes in
between there, I don't even open up the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even check the plants or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what you can do with organic
because all you're going to be doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: filling up your reservoir with the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, you know, you do have to do
some defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't talk about that, but we still do
our defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still do a lollipop in one thing that,
um, I don't know that we brought up or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting way better results as
far as yield for people worrying about
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I don't do any training as
opposed to, I got plenty of girls where
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put up the trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're weaving the branches through and
everything, you know, you know what the
[SPEAKER_00]: deal is, but I'm getting a way better
yield by just letting the plants naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: do what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I top them one time and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's really about finding
whatever works for you, but I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you guys organic, no low stress
training, just lollipop, no trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if they need to, you can use
bamboo stakes or whatever, or you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: the trellis to hold them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm saying as far as training,
don't do any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a great result just using
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the easiest way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of you guys that don't have
a green thumb, you think you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: green thumb, you should really try this
organic water only method because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably going to be the easiest way for
you to get a successful growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one more question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a new question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to start asking people
towards the end of the episode from here
[SPEAKER_01]: on out, potentially rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the top three genetics that
you've grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top three genetics that I've grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you say top three, just in my opinion
or the result that you like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: top three that you like for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, I would have to give not in any
particular order, but the number one,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing that came to my mind was
the fast buds West coast OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because that was my biggest growth
for us, the grams and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also I love square one genetics slash
Robin Hood seeds, TAC Titan, wedding cake
[SPEAKER_00]: cross with banana butter cups,
Nana's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, guys pick anything from,
from Titan square one Robin Hood seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a bad one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown a lot of his stuff and I
love all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of those, anything from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I had one of the girls
that people know me for is the utter
[SPEAKER_00]: madness that I did from soul fire gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the purple one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get a lot of compliments on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would probably say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything from square one Robin Hood seeds,
West coast OG fast buds, so fire gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: utter madness was probably my favorite
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives folks some things to look out
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: She went, I know lots of people shopping
for genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, check out those ones and yeah,
I can vouch for THC Titan as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Square one genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he just, everything I've grown from
him has been incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had him on a different podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a part of back in like 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: 17 or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to get him on the garden talk
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's tough guy to get ahold of these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may need the audience's help here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can DM him flood his, uh,
his comment section or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: let him know to come onto garden talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's welcome to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to have him on because of him
about, because I think I know I'm biased
[SPEAKER_00]: towards me, but I really think that if I
could create my own strain, it would be
[SPEAKER_00]: something that'd be very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate the seeds that you gave me by
the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, I wanted to see if I could
partner with him on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think I'm a pretty good face for a
strain base drop, base drop OG or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I could just start from the bottom
and do it myself, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously I'm going to do, but be good to
partner with somebody with so much
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and I respect what he does so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's fired to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite, probably my favorite
breeder Titan for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome conversation, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have a coin in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, if you're on Instagram,
the rookie Mike colleges on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it's a verified one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought of my life that I'll be
one of these people that people make a
[SPEAKER_00]: fake profiles copy, but there's about a
hundred people on Instagram pretending to
[SPEAKER_00]: be me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get scammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't buy anything from me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not selling anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get scammed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the rookie Mike colleges on Instagram
and then on YouTube goodies for 20,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rookie Mike colleges based drop.

[SPEAKER_01]: channels, you can scroll down to the
bottom of that homepage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well the channel page and then see all
of your channels on there.
