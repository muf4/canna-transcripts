[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically lean more towards liquid
cultures just because I can store them in
[SPEAKER_01]: my fridge for quite a bit of time in
slants or even just in a in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually popcorn is one of my favorite
go-tos just because of availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very very easy to find some organic
popcorn and you can boil that up and
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a really important factor you want
to make sure that you're just using enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to saturate and mix between the grains but
not actually create puddles anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing any green I would just
ditch the jar don't even open it ditch
[SPEAKER_01]: your bag whatever it is as it spreads very
aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get disheartened you're gonna see a
lot of contamination but once you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: get to the mushrooms it makes it all
worthwhile and you get some awesome food
[SPEAKER_01]: and some just some nutrient-dense
goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast
this episode number 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Cory from HTG
Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has many years experience growing
gourmet mushrooms and that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a more beginner
friendly episode talking about the steps
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow mushrooms from the equipment all
the way through harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support you can do so by

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Corey from HTG
Supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great and great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk all about how to
grow gourmet mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lion's mane, shiitake, oyster,
reishi, portobello, turkey tail,
[SPEAKER_00]: the list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of medicinal value when it
comes to mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to be a great to have
somebody on the podcast today that has
[SPEAKER_00]: many years experience cultivating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk about how to
cultivate mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and kind of how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much since I was just a young
kid, my family members, my mom and grandma
[SPEAKER_01]: have always had a pretty big plot garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Raised in the Midwest where just about
everybody is related to a farmer in some
[SPEAKER_01]: way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very therapeutic for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quieting down in the garden and
focusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that being able to tie into a hobby
that I could feed myself, it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: bound to be as I was made for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when did mushrooms come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how long have you been cultivating
them and what made you get into them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically about seven years ago,
I was at a restaurant and I pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: really didn't like mushrooms that much at
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had a really awesome mushroom dish
and it was mostly oysters.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was also some shiitake diced into
it, but it was just really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it blew my mind because I thought I
hated mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I, you know, dive deeper in
and see how many different mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: options there were, I realized I was just
eating gross mushrooms rather than having
[SPEAKER_01]: really good quality ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then, you know, realized that it was a
plant and it was, you know, essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you could grow yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I went ahead and learned how
to grow it.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what type of mushrooms have you
cultivated in the past?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some of your favorite
mushrooms to cultivate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done pretty much oysters,
piopinis, lions, main, shiitakes,
[SPEAKER_01]: chestnuts, trumpets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now my favorite is the black pearl
king oyster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hybrid trumpet oyster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets really thick and meaty and you're
able to really do a lot of meat,
[SPEAKER_01]: like mock meat dishes with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are several different ways to
cultivate mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on the type that you are
looking to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different tools and equipment
that you need to grow mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the tools and equipment
that are needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about container, substrate,
light, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll need somewhere to create spawn in,
i.e.
[SPEAKER_01]: like a bag or a jar or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll also need a pressure
cooker.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be pretty important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for your sterilization and
pasteurization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you're also going to need somewhere
to actually grow the mushrooms in,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a fruiting chamber or a Martha tent
or even a mono tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways you can
grow mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have quite a few customers here at my
hydroponics store that use entire four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four or 10 by 10 grow tents to turn into a
giant fruiting chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then past that, you'll need a lot,
a lot of isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the thing you're going to
go through the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sterilization is key when growing
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very small LED light or a T5 fluorescent
or at a minimum even like a small rope
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those work out really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to need your
substrate itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically like to roll towards master's
mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: The master's mix is a 50-50 blend of soy
hull and oak.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take pellets of the compressed oak
and pellets of the soy hull and mix it at
[SPEAKER_01]: a 50-50 rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what the mushrooms,
these gourmet mushrooms really want is a
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy wood-ladent substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can either start with spore
syringes or liquid cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the differences
between those two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe talk about like the pros and cons to
each of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they both have really good value in
mycology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically your commercial spore syringes
will be a little more broad spectrum of
[SPEAKER_01]: spores inside of them, meaning that it's
going to be more than just one fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: body or mushroom cap that the spores came
from, meaning your gene pool will be very
[SPEAKER_01]: wide in phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get big ones, small ones,
short fat ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get all these different sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas typically with a liquid culture,
it's done from a specific mushroom if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's how I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get multi-spoored liquid cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just tend to not grow as well than a
single strain liquid culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liquid culture is definitely a lot faster
because you're essentially starting with a
[SPEAKER_01]: liquid suspended mycelium rather than the
spores, which if you think of the spores
[SPEAKER_01]: more like a seed in layman's terms,
that's what's going to grow the mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mycelium would be considered like
the roots of the mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're running with already
pre-germinated roots, essentially,
[SPEAKER_01]: versus starting from spore, which you have
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to germinate and create that
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just get a lot faster colonization
rate and typically a lot less
[SPEAKER_01]: contamination because those commercial
spore syringes coming from multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, there's a lot more chance for
contaminants to be inside those spore
[SPEAKER_01]: syringes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, both are really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically lean more towards liquid
cultures just because I can store them in
[SPEAKER_01]: my fridge for quite a bit of time in
slants or even just in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really, really work well for having a
lot of mushroom seed on hand, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of keep them in my fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple different strains in there at
different times and I can kind of rotate
[SPEAKER_01]: in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool when you have the
liquid cultures, whereas the spore
[SPEAKER_01]: syringes, think of it just like spores in
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave them in there too long,
they can germinate inside the syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there was a contaminant in there,
those contaminants are going to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: inside your spore syringe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most cultivators, though, tend to lean
towards the liquid cultures, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have one grow under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up buying a kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a kit with all the tools and
equipment in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my understanding, they sell the
spores separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time you have to find a
source for the spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually started with the spore syringe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never done liquid culture before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the spore syringe and then the kit
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to have everything I needed
in order to complete a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I remember having to do is
like they had had the spore syringe and
[SPEAKER_00]: then it was the inoculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had it was a mason jar and it came
with corn kernels in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was sealed up top and there was a
way for you to stick the syringe in
[SPEAKER_00]: through the top and then inoculate those
corn kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically inoculate the spores
into?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually popcorn is one of my favorite
go tos just because of availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very easy to find some organic
popcorn and you can boil that up and
[SPEAKER_01]: sterilize it and use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another really common one is rye grain
berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one, a couple of my friends like
to just use oats, just just plain oats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Millet is another really popular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really all depends on preference,
I find, and your technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a pressure cooker,
you might only be able to use millet or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that just because the
smaller seeds you don't have to get as hot
[SPEAKER_01]: to sterilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a couple different grain options,
but just about any grain will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it has starch inside of it,
it's a really good option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say availability would determine
which one you want to use, but just about
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone can go to the store and pick up
some popcorn and actually works pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I remember putting, I think I put
like three milliliters within that
[SPEAKER_00]: container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to have been like a quart size
mason jar that was like probably halfway
[SPEAKER_00]: full of the kernels, put like three
milliliters in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that pretty standard for all types of
mushrooms or does it really depend on the
[SPEAKER_00]: type, the variety of mushroom for how much
spores you want to put in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's more relative to how
much spawn you have inside the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you had like a three pound bag of
spawn, you would need anywhere from five
[SPEAKER_01]: to even eight mills or cc's of that spore
syringe into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these smaller containers, you can
definitely do one cc, three cc's.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you run into with that could be
an issue where you're using too much of
[SPEAKER_01]: these spore syringe and actually put too
much moisture into the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a really important factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make sure that you're just
using enough to saturate and mix between
[SPEAKER_01]: the grains, but not actually create
puddles anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like I mentioned, I don't have
any experience with the liquid cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you go about like the
inoculation process with the liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: cultures?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's a couple of different
ways you could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My go-to way is just good old carob syrup,
just like corn syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: The unflavored is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately, I've only been able to find like
vanilla flavored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely try to get unflavored corn
syrup or any carbohydrate will do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you could use molasses if you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will use cane sugar,
coconut sugar, coconut water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do prefer just water and some carob
syrup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you do is you'll cook that
up to sterilization temperatures for about
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 minutes in your pressure cooker,
about 15 psi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then once that's been sterilized,
you can then let it cool down to room
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you will inoculate your spore
syringe or your liquid culture into the
[SPEAKER_01]: broth that you've made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ideally, you'll want to put it on
like a magnetic stirrer with a little
[SPEAKER_01]: stirring device inside the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at a minimum, you can just hand stir
it maybe once or twice a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after about 10 to about 20 days,
depending on the temperature of the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll start to see that mycelium grow in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can literally just pull it up
with a syringe and inoculate whatever you
[SPEAKER_01]: like with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you've done the inoculation
process into your grain or whatever you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, what conditions should that be in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a certain temperature that should
sit in in order for growth to occur?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your inoculation temperature is going to
be roughly anywhere from about 75,
[SPEAKER_01]: 74, all the way up to about 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Warmer the faster, but also some
contaminants do grow at warmer
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that a little bit lower into the
78, 77 range is really fine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really gives me a pretty aggressive
mycelium growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you'll go into from your jar,
let's say like you had in your kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that's been fully inoculated and
colonized, and you see a lot of clean
[SPEAKER_01]: white mycelium in there, then you would
dump that grain out in a sterilized
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, like in front of a laminar flow
hood or at a minimum, like an upside down
[SPEAKER_01]: glove box, which is just a box that you
take, you cut some holes in the side of it
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can reach your arms inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you still air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that still air will make it so you're
not getting a whole lot of contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can spray a lot of alcohol in
there before you open up your jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll pour that into your
substrate bag or your substrate tub or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you're growing in your your
vessel you're going to fruit in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I used a grow tent and kind of use
that as the place to sterilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a little table within a grow tent
and like use Lysol and wiped everything
[SPEAKER_00]: around with isopropyl alcohol and just
tried to sterilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important because it can go
bad, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have you can completely ruin
everything if you don't sterilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's super, super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I aimed for about 78 degrees
Fahrenheit was I was aiming for and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: some good growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the quart mason jar was both I
think was about halfway full of the
[SPEAKER_00]: kernels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it took like 60 days maybe or
something like that to fully inoculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the time frame?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure it's dependent on a few
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, how long should it take to like
fully inoculate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so depending on what type of
mushroom it is, is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly affect the inoculate or the
colonization speed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically most gourmet mushrooms are
going to be anywhere from about 10 to
[SPEAKER_01]: about 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all those streams are going to fall
right inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the other mushrooms might take
anywhere from about 14 to seven days for
[SPEAKER_01]: full colonization, depending on grain as
well, like the popcorn we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of its caveats is it tends to colonize
a little bit slower just because it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: harder outer shell and its surface area is
a little bit greater versus like your
[SPEAKER_01]: millet, which very, very small seed,
kind of like bird seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you've ever had a bird before,
it's the really, really small seed in that
[SPEAKER_01]: seed mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seed being very small will be
taken over by that mycelium very quick and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll penetrate into the seed and consume
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after they have inoculated,
what should they look out for like each
[SPEAKER_00]: day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are their signs of good
growth happening and what signs of bad
[SPEAKER_00]: growth happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you'll see the mycelium start
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from wherever it does grow,
it almost seems like it's a random point
[SPEAKER_01]: in the jar that will start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from there, it'll kind of nucleate
outwards from these points.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have, you know, multiple points
inside the jar, which will have this
[SPEAKER_01]: spherical or cylindrical growth rate away
from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to see a nice run of that
mycelium daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some mycelium you might see inches,
some you might see centimeters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you want to see is that even
growth rate and it's stretching and
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming those grains.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you want to look out for is
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that isn't a really nice,
white, healthy, clean-looking mycelium is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be considered a contaminant
unless it's a metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metabolites are kind of an amber-brownish
liquid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider those guys like waste of the
mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be, in layman's terms,
mushroom poop and pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: It consumes the food source and releases
that exudite of metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually antiseptic, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty sterile itself in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the contaminants that you're going to
want to look for are mostly trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that or cobweb mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichoderma is going to be a very,
very green mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, parts of it can be gray and even
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: But green is really the main thing you're
going to want to look out for.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're seeing any green, I would just
ditch the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't even open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ditch your bag, whatever it is,
as it spreads very aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can sporulate inside your grow
space and be very hard to get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, just really looking for those
small growths in mycelium and checking for
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants and patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about blue mold?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue mold, like growing on the mycelium
itself or on the actual food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you see that often, like the
compost, for example, if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: composting, there's like a blue type of
mold that occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that ever happen on the mushroom side
of things when you grow mushrooms or now?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hundreds of blue molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of blue is typically bruising of
a particular type of mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually active mushrooms will have a
bluish hue.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of other mushrooms that
have the same bluish bruising to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most common ones are active.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are definitely blue molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not super common inside grains,
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see more green molds, pink molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also see very, very common is
bacillus or wet spot is what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: considered in the mycelium world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that looks very, very like brown and
slimy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looks very gross, almost like snot
and brown is growing on your your grains
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once that happens, that's another you
know, I'd consider that just toss it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing with with mushroom growing and
mycology, if you're getting into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't be disheartened by failure or
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't even consider contamination a
failure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would consider that a learning point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most contamination can be
tracked back to poor technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is like your
sterilization process or how much did you
[SPEAKER_01]: use ISO?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you clean your tools in between
transfers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you make sure your room was
sterilized?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even worse, was the culture you were
using contaminated from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be quite a few
failures and complete loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lost whole grow tents just full of
gourmet mushrooms due to quite a few
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just happens happens to everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't get disheartened.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a lot of
contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you actually get to the
mushrooms, it makes it all worthwhile and
[SPEAKER_01]: you get some awesome food and some just
some nutrient dense goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's say the person is successful,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've fully inoculated their jar or
their grain is fully inoculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ready to change over to the
substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for a substrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I particularly like to use master's mix
for the gourmet mushrooms, which is that
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50 blend of the oak and soy hull
pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of sapphire philic mushrooms,
which are mushrooms that eat decaying
[SPEAKER_01]: waste and matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those types of mushrooms really like
to grow on a multitude of different
[SPEAKER_01]: substrates, most common vermiculite and
coconut coir mixed together with some sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of manure or even a worm casting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the gourmet mushrooms,
it is most common a oat or a whole of some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind with a heavy amount of wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of different blends,
but I particularly like the master's mix
[SPEAKER_01]: from Mushroom Media online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really awesome stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually working on getting it in my
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can take a couple scoops to the
desired amount of weight you want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: and add X amount of water and you have all
the substrate you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to check out that blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one that I used, I have it right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two-pound bag pasteurized.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was dehydrated elephant and horse
manure, vermiculite and gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound like a pretty decent
substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything that worthy of calling
out there that would maybe be a pro or a
[SPEAKER_00]: con?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: That all seems pretty all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than it being elephant, that's a
great dung source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would only consider its availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might be a little hard to get
elephant poop on the regular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you live by a zoo and the zoo was
willing to give it away, then definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: go for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with any poop or manure or dung,
you want to make sure that it's properly
[SPEAKER_01]: composted and aged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with a lot of dung and manure,
if it isn't properly composted and aged,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can pass on salmonella, quite a few
other foodborne illnesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to really make sure that
you're getting manure from a farmer who
[SPEAKER_01]: knows what he's doing and has aged his
product properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And contaminants will come too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at what point do you actually transfer
what you've inoculated to the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And feel free to break it down in details.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even down to the nitty gritty details of
putting on the gloves to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's clean and sterile and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll start by saying I'll get the
repetitive part out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in between every step, insert the
step where you spray down all the
[SPEAKER_01]: surfaces, your hands, your tools,
and everything with isopropyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you are using a alcohol flame for
needle sterilization, then you do not want
[SPEAKER_01]: to be spraying alcohol because then it's
flammable and that will turn out well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But insert alcohol sprays everywhere,
but you'll definitely want to glove up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glove box if you don't have a laminar flow
hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll just go with the glove box
option because not everybody has a laminar
[SPEAKER_01]: flow hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty big and pricey and bulky,
but just about everyone can make a glove
[SPEAKER_01]: box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to take the top of your
glove box off and you're going to put all
[SPEAKER_01]: of your work inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to close your glove
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by work, I mean all of your Petri
dishes or spore syringes or your bags or
[SPEAKER_01]: tubs or whatever you're working on inside
this clean space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spray with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have forgot already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we're going to open our mycelium or
our spawn or whatever we're using inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the sterile environment and dump it into
the substrate mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your substrate mix might be in a big tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be in a box.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be in a small bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mix it up inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get very large glove boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think they're about like 32 or so
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big Rubbermaid totes with their all
clear plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend the largest one you can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you have a very large workspace
and you're not confined to this little
[SPEAKER_01]: shoe box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sterilize, sterilize, sterilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to actually pull
that mycelium out and place it into your
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it up really fine and mix it
thoroughly into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to cover your
inoculated substrate from the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're also going to want to seal the
CO2 in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any breathing ports on the
side of your monotub or a filter patch on
[SPEAKER_01]: the side of your mushroom bag,
there's a certain way you could fold that
[SPEAKER_01]: patch over so it's not just dumping out
all the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the monotubs, you can just put
tape on your side holes on the monotub
[SPEAKER_01]: there to trap that CO2 in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to let it sit for
about 10 to about 30 days for that
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate to fully colonize just like our
little jar did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll completely turn nice and white like
a big old brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once we get to there,
we can start going into our fruiting
[SPEAKER_01]: initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned clear tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I actually use a clear tub as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say it's probably maybe 18
inches long by maybe about 10 inches wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So height, maybe a foot tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real small tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going personally for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I was advised was to
use, I have a black plastic liner that you
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilize and then put in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps with, helps reduce,
I'm terrible with the terminology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's called pinning or
something like that, but basically these,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll start to fruit underneath the whole
substrate kind of come off the sides and
[SPEAKER_00]: just not like fruit naturally out from the
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend doing something like
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, I mean, you mentioned clear
containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black container, would that prevent that
from happening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you went ahead and like,
let's say that tote you have where you
[SPEAKER_01]: normally put your plastic if you went and
painted that same length black or even
[SPEAKER_01]: covered it with black tape, that would
effectively do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I actually prefer that plastic bag a
little bit better because you'll sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: get separation from your mycelium block
off of the side of the plastic wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bag will actually grab that
mycelium block.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really helped with moisture retention
and prevent that side pinning you're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about where you got those pesky
little mushrooms on the side that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: can't get to, or it's a pain to get to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just, they're just not
aesthetically pleasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned it's going to take,
you know, roughly 10 days, maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: longer for that substrate to be kind of
completely inoculated, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to turn out to be this
white brick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you introduce light?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what light should be added and
when should you add it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really don't need any light until
you're ready to fruit the mycelium block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or brick and that light really,
you don't need a whole lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of misconception about lights and
mushrooms is that you need this big old
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful light when you really,
all you need is enough light to direct the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms, which way to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you had a 150 watt LED light
versus, you know, a 50 watt T5 LED light,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to grow more mushrooms
with the bigger light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smaller light will do just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And almost the same exact job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to go with the really low dose,
low end of the spectrum with your lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally a desk lamp.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's all you have, you can utilize
that and that'll be more than enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rope lights are pretty efficient as well
at that, but don't need a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to be a 12 hour cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very similar to most fruiting and
flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will, that mixed with fresh air
exchange, which is going to be your CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: and fresh air transfer from your actual
fruiting chamber.
[SPEAKER_01]: That with the 12 hour light cycle will
initiate your fruiting conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the first two weeks or so,
you are going to be under no light at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you add the light,
12 hour light cycle, that's when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start to fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said there should be exchange
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit more in detail
about the actual exchange that happens as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as air?
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have a fresh air exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is you want to expel
the CO2 out of the grow chamber or the
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting chamber or wherever you're
fruiting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the mycelium will continually make
and produce CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's too much CO2 prevalent,
you'll get really tall and leggy and
[SPEAKER_01]: stretchy mushrooms that sometimes can't
even stand up on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just look really misshapen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's hard to get a nice, good,
even canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush of mushrooms or even just get your
mushrooms to get a good yield off on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of different things you can do
for your fresh air exchange is if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in a monotub, which most people growing
saffrofilic mushrooms are in a monotub,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll have your holes on the side of it,
typically two on each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right above your soil line,
about three to six inches above where your
[SPEAKER_01]: substrate line will be is where you'll
want these holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you want to think of CO2 like
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it fills up a room is it's going
to fill from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll place your holes right above
where your canopy would be for your
[SPEAKER_01]: mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way it'll flow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fresh air exchange will be
going through a little piece of polyfill
[SPEAKER_01]: or a filter patch at point two or point
five micron.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the polyfill, which is really
just the stuff you find in inside pillows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get it at craft stores and Joanne
Fabrics and all kinds of places like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you just pop that inside of the
hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the air going through is filtered.
[SPEAKER_01]: No contaminants are making it through
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but CO2 and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another little step you can do is
open your tote daily and fan it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that typically will lead to you
opening the door to more contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tend to not fan as much and try to
focus on having a proper fresh air
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange with the holes placed properly on
the tub.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way it doesn't allow the tub to
fill up to a really high level of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an exhaust fan on your tent will help
as well if you're inside of one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: tents, fresh air exhausting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then mushrooms will start to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clearly see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point do you harvest those
mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on what kind of mushroom it
is, if it's a gilled mushroom or I'm going
[SPEAKER_01]: to try to stick with more layman's terms
or like a polypore mushroom, which one has
[SPEAKER_01]: gills and one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing the type of mushroom
that has gills, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: wait for that veil to break off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the veil is right below the cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like this almost like a skirt
that connects completely around the edge
[SPEAKER_01]: of the cap to the bottom of the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that mushroom opens up kind of like
a umbrella wood, it tends to pop that
[SPEAKER_01]: little veil that connects.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that mushroom pops open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see those gills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically you'll want to get it right as
or right before that veil is bursting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a perfect time to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're growing polypores or oyster
mushrooms or anything like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll want to wait until the mushroom has
opened up and the bottom of it goes from
[SPEAKER_01]: curling down towards where your stem is
from curling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll kind of look like the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hard way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you've ever seen a blue whale,
the way it holds its neck up, it has those
[SPEAKER_01]: big grates on it on its neck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that and it's almost like the
whale tilts its head up after looking
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really what it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when your oyster mushrooms are
ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically before they drop spores.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're dropping spores really heavily,
you've kind of went a little bit past that
[SPEAKER_01]: window of when it's perfect to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the one I had, the veils opened up
and spores were released.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know if you are looking to do
multiple flushes, basically if the veil
[SPEAKER_00]: opens up and the spores get released,
it kind of prevents more fruiting from
[SPEAKER_00]: happening, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I was always told harvest
right before the veil actually opens up to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the spores from actually kind of
getting all over the rest of the substrate
[SPEAKER_00]: and preventing that fruiting from
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those spores, once they dump, if they're
left there for long, they can start to
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll also start to get new mycelium
growing because it is a new mushroom,
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those new mushrooms growing on top of
that old mycelium, you might have a clash
[SPEAKER_01]: where definitely it would halt that
fruiting and kind of shift its gear over
[SPEAKER_01]: to, ah, I'm being attacked by this outside
external mushroom and switch from its
[SPEAKER_01]: fruiting and you get some really weird
stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you go to actually pick the
mushrooms, what's your preferred
[SPEAKER_00]: technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are you just going down there with
your hand and kind of pinching it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom and twisting and pulling off or
using, you know, trimmers to kind of get
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and prune at the very bottom of
the base of the mushroom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm growing in a monotub,
I prefer to actually grab that little
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of plastic you were talking about
and actually pull the whole block.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of the tub and place it on a big old
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just take a pair of scissors and
right above the mycelium line,
[SPEAKER_01]: just cut like you would you're trimming
the grass or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut all those down as low as you can,
as close as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for those woodloving mushrooms,
most of the gourmets, I actually do those
[SPEAKER_01]: by hand and you just kind of place your
hand right up underneath where the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycelium and the fruiting body reach each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're just kind of kind of
jostle it left to right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll just kind of pop right off the
whole mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I like to do those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you pick the mushrooms,
a lot of people they'll do is they'll dry
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it depends on the variety and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But talk to us about like the drying
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does that take?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just lay it out on a paper towel,
for example, or should you be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something else with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a bunch of different ways
you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the the dehydrator method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very quick and efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll set your dehydrator on on the
lowest setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them now days even have a mushroom
setting or nuts and fruits and berries,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the lowest temperature is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that could take anywhere from a
day to two days, depending on how big the
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can also air dry them, just like
you would any other herbs or plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say if you've ever done like basil
or oregano or thyme, get some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: large drying nets and you can just lay
them out on the nets for about seven days,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes 14 days, depending on the
humidity and the temperature in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, pretty straightforward stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you will definitely lose about 80,
sometimes 90 percent of your mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: weight to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you when you're drying out and you
got this big, hefty, crazy full net,
[SPEAKER_01]: you come back in 10 to 14 days and it's
it's light and fluffy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like styrofoam almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's some medicinal plants that
are grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they do the drying process,
they lose about the same amount of weight,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 75, 80 percent of the weight is
actually water weight to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, they'll dry it and then
they'll weigh it after the fact and and
[SPEAKER_00]: see all the damage that has been done as
far as the amount of moisture that has
[SPEAKER_00]: been lost there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, very similar there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say once they're dry,
as long as they're stored in a airtight
[SPEAKER_01]: container, I would say indefinitely
they're they're pretty much good
[SPEAKER_01]: indefinitely as long as they're not re
hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really, really long term store
some mushrooms as long as they're properly
[SPEAKER_01]: dried and stored in an airtight container.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we're like a traditional plastic
baggy sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would avoid that altogether,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would avoid the plastic bags
unless you're you might be able to do like
[SPEAKER_01]: a skunk bag or like a grove bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wouldn't do like a sandwich bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd want it to be specifically or like a
food service mylar bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could definitely do one of those or
like a glass or steel receptacle like a
[SPEAKER_01]: sea vault or a big glass mason jar or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have lots of beginners tuning into
this podcast, and I'm sure there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are either just starting
growing mushrooms or they're about to
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a step back and looking at the
entire process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for someone who's
new to growing mushrooms?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might sound cliche, but, you know,
have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a it is a hobby at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hobbies should be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you should you should be having
fun while you're learning this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll take it back to what I said
earlier, where contaminants are mostly,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, from just a poor technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that means is you might have just
did something wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means you can go back and fix it
and do it right the next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be disheartened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start from failure and have lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my final one would be kind of
what you did as I'd recommend to start
[SPEAKER_01]: with a kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're really on the fence about it,
there's a lot of companies that sell kits.
[SPEAKER_01]: My company included HTG supply dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have quite a few different little
mushroom starter kits on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mostly just substrate that you'd
add mycelium to, like you were saying you
[SPEAKER_01]: did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, get a kit and have some fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to check out those kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in need of another one because I ran
out of substrate and the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have to shop through your website
next time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a hold of me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll set you up with something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can get find me through HTG
supply dot com or you can just come down
[SPEAKER_01]: into my local store if you're in the
Illinois area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're located at 4461 44th Street in Rock
Island, Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have just about everything you could
need from gardening to mushroom
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then coming up soon, we have lots and
