[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity sent me their Ion Grid T24
full spectrum LED grow light and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the unboxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light has a coverage area of
2 feet by 4 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls 260 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: at full power and has an efficiency of
2.75 micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out the box is the user manual
and it has things such as installation
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions, programming instructions,
and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bag has things for cable management
such as zip ties and velcro straps,
[SPEAKER_00]: two light ratchet hangers, two UIS
extension cables, two stainless steel
[SPEAKER_00]: brackets, one for each side of the
fixture, two DC extension cords,
[SPEAKER_00]: two driver adapters, and there's a 12 foot
power cord attached to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: This fixture has 560 diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of them are Samsung LM301H.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a digital controller that you
can use to program light schedules,
[SPEAKER_00]: mimic sunrise and sunset, and dim the
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see here, I have it hung in my
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 2 foot by 4 foot grow tent,
also by AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the clip-on oscillating fan that you
see here is, once again, by AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a link to the grow light,
grow tent, and oscillating fan down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this light is for a 2 foot by 4
foot grow space, they make this grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: for other grow spaces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the T22 for a 2 foot by 2 foot
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the T33 for a 3 foot by 3 foot
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have the T44 for a 4 foot by 4
foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link all of them down in the YouTube
description section below, along with my
[SPEAKER_00]: discount code MRGROWAT15.
[SPEAKER_00]: That discount code works on both Amazon
and their website acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like to see another video where
I go over the controller settings in
[SPEAKER_00]: detail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you in
the next video.
