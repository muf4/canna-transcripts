[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Chris from Happy
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to be back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say you were the third
episode on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was actually back in January 9th,
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dug this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the environments for
indoor plants, temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, and air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has over 250 thousand views on
YouTube alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't even count the podcast
platforms because we're not there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I never expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually had someone from my
hometown come up to me when I was there,
[SPEAKER_01]: like over the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, yo, dude, I saw you on Mr.
Grow It.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's funny, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, yeah, man, you came a long way,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've been around for a long time,
at least our relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think 2017 is when we really first
connected and you wanted to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsorship through me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were one of the first ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had you and then like, I think one or
two of the brands actually reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I found out about you and really
when we sat down and had that first
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation and I learned about you,
your vision, Happy Hydro, how you put
[SPEAKER_00]: customers first, quality first,
I knew that it was a good fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are, what, five years,
six years later, and we're still like
[SPEAKER_00]: connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still collaborating and I'm still a
big supporter of Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really glad to have you on here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a great topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be talking about stealth
gardening indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had somebody do stealth
gardening outdoors, guy over in Europe,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to like disguise his voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had to put a mask on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, it was pretty crazy, but indoors
is going to be a whole different
[SPEAKER_00]: battlefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to get into this with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it has been a long time and I'm
pretty sure when we did that first,
[SPEAKER_01]: that first sponsorship, I don't even think
I really had a website yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just starting up, you know,
on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like a basic website with just like
scissors and led loop and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we came a long way now, dude,
like we've got everything you can ever
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine on the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to take this opportunity to
shout out to the boys and girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends that I work with and you know,
I've known these people for 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years, Matt, Aaron, Brandon,
Nick, Lourdes and Jessica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Happy Hydro team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like, I just feel like I wouldn't
be sitting here with you for the second
[SPEAKER_01]: time here if it wasn't for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys, if you guys ever shop at
happyhydro.com, you'll probably interact
[SPEAKER_01]: with any of these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're doing a good job and we all
love what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So great team over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've met a handful of them in person and
really, really for the customer again,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing great things over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get too deep into the topic,
we talk about stealth gardening here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, um, it started when I was,
you know, pretty young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my first plant I grew, uh,
in my bedroom and I had tin foil on the
[SPEAKER_01]: walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just watching YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, just one plant, you know,
I want to try to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know a month in two months in
my mom found it, ripped it all apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just walked in one day and it was all
gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried getting it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, after that, I just was
always intrigued by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this was back in, you know,
2014, 15, 16, 17, um, it was a different
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'm in New York where things,
you know, just this year, uh, within the
[SPEAKER_01]: past two years have become legal and,
and, and free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent a lot of time and met a lot of
people who have had, had a stealth grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, uh, I worked at the hydro store for
a long time where I just got to meet so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people and learn so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'm excited to share some of those
stories and so that knowledge I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the years about how to keep
your grow on the, on the down low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause even if it is legal,
you know, some landlords don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your neighbors might not like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super smelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like, it's not like just drinking
a couple beers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't smell beers three
doors down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important even though,
um, even if you are in a legal state,
[SPEAKER_01]: just to be respectable to your neighbors
and, and just, you know, landlords,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever everyone, it's an important thing
to know, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you not only have experienced growing
medicinal plants, but you also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable garden, correct me if I'm wrong,
but you have a pretty extensive vegetable
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do, I think it's mostly outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've probably dabbled indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of break down what you've got
growing on a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so right now I have a four by eight
grassroots fabric pot in my backyard with
[SPEAKER_01]: a blue mat watering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the soaker hose, a blue soak system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically it's just hooked up to my
hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the fabric bed has, uh, it's like a
plastic liner in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it keeps the moisture content a little
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of the, um, inside of the bed than
a typical fabric pot paired with the,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, paired with the blue mats that are
just constantly releasing just the tiniest
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've got a ton of living soil and
compost and top soil and perlite,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, dude, things just, you're talking
eight foot tall tomato plants at the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just insane, like unlimited amounts
of zucchini.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I really don't have to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just, you set the blue mat up,
you plant the seeds in the beginning and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just go time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of weeding, but not much
being in the four by eight bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I've actually really enjoyed,
I've really enjoyed growing in that four
[SPEAKER_01]: by eight bed and growing, um, tomatoes,
cherry tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm a huge fan of zucchini and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we do basil and carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: My son, he's two and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves the carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he'll dig them up three times and off
to replant them and they'll come out all
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of mangled at the end of the
year, but he's still stoked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my wife, um, she grew up on a
farm and, uh, so she has a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience, uh, growing flowers and just
being in greenhouses and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just like, you know, it's
nostalgic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really can't wait to teach my son.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to, you know, garden on his own and
just continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I could see myself adding more and
more raised beds and, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll sneak a medicinal plant in that
raised bed every, every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned your son and being able to
teach him to garden in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, I have a daughter now and
I same way, I cannot wait till I can start
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching her how to garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as hiding those things from your
son, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be kind of stealth around
him or are you going to eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce your plants to hear your
children at some point early on or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I had it, if I was growing in the
house, I would be very, um, cognizant of
[SPEAKER_01]: odors, uh, mostly just orders,
you know, noise and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but my philosophy really is to treat
it just like a beer or alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's not for kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for grownups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't really feel the need to
hide it, but if I, if I were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, just for the respect of my whole
family, I would make sure that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, odor is controlled all the time
and, um, which can be difficult,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially when you're opening your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, you could have your odor
perfectly fine and then you open the tent
[SPEAKER_01]: for 20 minutes and now your whole house is
the stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some tricks that we can talk
about to, um, to kind of combat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of set yourself up in a way
that you can still work in your garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also have, uh, control over orders
and, and, and to be stealthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could probably get into that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but one thing I did want to comment on
just to follow up is, yeah, I feel the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way about as far as not really hiding
it from the kid, but teaching them that
[SPEAKER_00]: this is for adults, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something for adults, maybe keep them
distance, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want them be in contact with
the, the trichomes or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of a sudden they get all of the hands
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the toys are sticking to their
hands.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in there, they're hanging all the
things all over the planet, like a
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas tree or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I totally get what you mean by
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think that's kind of a separate
conversation is kids and medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and when you introduce to them and teach
them and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had that conversation on the,
from the stash podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, you know, Rob and pigeons long
time ago, we talked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a great conversation,
but a whole different separate
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into stealth growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you brought up the smell
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we could probably get into some
other things like how to get equipment in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out of the house, how you hide it from
roommates or your landlord and highlight
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for smell, when you've got the smell
there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants do smell particularly in the
flowering stage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even a veg, you're going to have some
plant smell happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about hiding the smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start with like the easiest kind of
quickest but laziest way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and that is, you know,
say, say the smell is just kind of out of
[SPEAKER_01]: control, you know, you haven't been taking
care of it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got someone coming over and,
uh, and you know, you just don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: them, you don't want them to know about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe they, maybe they know that
you consume, but you don't want them to
[SPEAKER_01]: know about light one up, just light one up
clouded up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're just going to smell that
and they're not going to know that you've,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you've got a garden in the,
in the back bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess that's like number one easiest,
laziest kind of just, but really it's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy because you know,
like I said, you open up the tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: smell leaks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you trim a plant without stinking
up the whole house?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there are some things that,
that you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but before we get into those,
I think the first thing we should talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about is, um, negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, negative pressure is when,
uh, you're, say you're looking at your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent and you have your, your fan,
it's sitting on top of the carbon filter
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe the carbon filter is mounted and
the fans, uh, beside it and it's pumping
[SPEAKER_01]: air out, um, through the ducting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll notice that the sides of the tent
start to squeeze in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those sides of the tent are
squeezing in, that means that no air is
[SPEAKER_01]: leaking out through your zipper holes
through, um, the holes in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_01]: the tent, uh, in the bottom of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, match holes, uh, basically any
hole, um, because no matter how well a
[SPEAKER_01]: tent is built, there's always going to be
a hole, uh, whether you can see it or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: that odors can get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So negative pressure basically makes it so
the stinky air that's in the tent only has
[SPEAKER_01]: one way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's through the carbon filter where
it's scrubbed of odors and then out the
[SPEAKER_01]: tube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you got to check that tubing for
holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a hole in, your ducting,
um, your whole, your carbon filter will be
[SPEAKER_01]: useless.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to check your connections,
um, where your ducting connects to the
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon filter, uh, where it connects to
the fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make sure all those are tight
and sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can use, um, tape and make a
special duct tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, not like your traditional duct tape,
but like the foil duct tape that can,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is heat resistant that, um,
you can seal it up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's like, you know, say you do
all that and you got your negative
[SPEAKER_01]: pressure, and everything's good,
but you got to work on your plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to open up the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You open up that tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not going to, unless your fan is,
you know, a 12 inch monster vortex fan and
[SPEAKER_01]: a two by four tent, you're not going to be
able to keep negative pressure with a,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the door open.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's ways around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one way is a long room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you utilize either the closet or the
bedroom that your grow tent is in as a
[SPEAKER_01]: quote unquote long room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you could do is you could have a,
a four inch carbon fan and filter inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the tent that is creating negative
pressure in the tent at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then inside of the bedroom or closet
that you're in, you can have a bigger fan
[SPEAKER_01]: that's rated for whatever size the room is
with a carbon filter, um, exhausting out
[SPEAKER_01]: the window.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you've got, you've got negative
pressure twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got it in the tent and then you
also have it in the room and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that the door is closed to the
room when you're working in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that, that should protect you,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you open up the tent, you still have
negative pressure in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smell isn't going to leak out under
the door and you can work in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can close it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, once, you know, half hour
after you close it up, if you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could turn off the, um, carbon filter
in the big room, you know, and only,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, running in the small room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that is really kind of the big
thing that, uh, that people can do to
[SPEAKER_01]: really like have it under control for,
for most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you have a little bit of experience
with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is that something that you ever tried?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon filters are definitely key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran carbon filters for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't even bother to run them
anymore, to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause I'm just pumping it out up into my
attic and it's being ventilated out my
[SPEAKER_00]: roof, but I'm not really hiding the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really need to hide the smell much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, aren't there like gel products
or something that you can, that come in
[SPEAKER_00]: containers that people use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you used any of those?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those effective or incense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people burn incense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never used incense for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've used incense to cover up,
uh, when I was lighting up when I was 16
[SPEAKER_01]: in my bedroom, but I don't think it,
I don't think it tricked my mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't smell that bad in the veg
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they do a little bit, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's still, it's enough, but it's not
as nearly, uh, as potent as the bloom
[SPEAKER_01]: stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, uh, when I was doing a little
bit of research on this, just to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: recap for the podcast, I, I found that
there are some, um, varieties out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that are, uh, have lower odors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're just known for having lower
odors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's also something that if
people are concerned about, they can look
[SPEAKER_01]: into, but the, um, the gel blocks that
you're referring to, um, ONA blocks is one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the, um, this is basically the top
brand and they work fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got thousands of reviews,
four and a half stars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we sell them on Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone wants to look for them,
they can take a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, mostly if you have your carbon
filter set up properly and you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some sort of lung room kind of set up
properly too, you don't need them,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, really until like your harvest and
your trimming and just when it gets to a
[SPEAKER_01]: point where you're at a point where,
you know, it gets a little out of control
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're harvesting and trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's when you can, you might want
to introduce something like these ONA
[SPEAKER_01]: blocks that just basically overpower the,
the odor with its own odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Febreze on steroids almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't personally tried that stuff,
but, uh, I've heard some good things about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about hiding the light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people may say, Oh, what are you
talking about light?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sealed up in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really, it's gonna not
really be exposed, but what about like
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are just growing in a bedroom,
for example, the window that might be
[SPEAKER_00]: light leakage through the window that
might be likely underneath the door and
[SPEAKER_00]: then try to hide it from their roommates
or family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about hiding the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the best tricks for hiding the
light, uh, from escaping outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: window, um, is to just have like,
you know, normal curtains in front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: window.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can build a box at a two by
four and plywood that just comes out and
[SPEAKER_01]: around the curtain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just install that over top of the
curtain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, whoever's looking into the
house, you know, it just looks like normal
[SPEAKER_01]: curtains.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no, uh, there's no black garbage
bag taped over the window or just,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no, nothing weird like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, normal curtains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of the best tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, otherwise, yeah, you're pretty much
stuck to just using like some seven mil,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Panda film, you know, black and white
to, uh, to, to block the light out or
[SPEAKER_01]: something of the sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are kind of the, those are mostly
the only options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then even with grow tents,
you know, if you're, you're growing in a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent and you're having people over,
grow tents leak light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, pretty much all of them leak a little
bit of light, whether it's through a
[SPEAKER_01]: stitch in a zipper or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so a lot of grow lights and a lot of
this equipment nowadays you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, control from your phone with these
automation apps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you know someone's coming over or
whatever and, uh, you can shut the light
[SPEAKER_01]: off for a little while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can turn your turn your fan down
to its lowest setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to turn your fan off
completely because then your odors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll, you'll lose your negative pressure
and your odors leak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you turn your fan down to its
lowest setting, quiet it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: turn the light off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and those are, those are some tricks,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I use poly film that you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have them cover my window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really does look black on the
outside, but I have sunscreens as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the desert and sunscreens are very
valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out here during the daytime, you can't
really see that it's like a black sheet,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and during nighttime,
you'd have to actually be shining light
[SPEAKER_00]: through it in order to kind of see that,
uh, that black poly film on the windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly use it for keeping the light out of
the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly it's, it's good for,
for keeping light from escaping the room
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for my doors, uh, what I use is on the
bottom there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's that space saying I use draft
guards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you search on Amazon, Amazon twin
draft guard, it basically is like a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of styrofoam and plastic circular,
and it's the length of the door and you
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just slide it underneath the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it prevents any light or anything
really from coming into that bottom part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I did was cut up poly film
because of the cracks of the door all
[SPEAKER_00]: around the, the edges there, light was
coming in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would cut up a piece of the poly
film and just basically cover,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I'm opening up and closing the
door, sure, there's like a flap of poly
[SPEAKER_00]: film.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that prevents light from coming in and
it would work well for preventing light
[SPEAKER_00]: from going out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget, mention those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's kind of a good segue
into, um, into how taking this adventure
[SPEAKER_01]: and starting to grow on your own can
really teach you a lot about DIY.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can learn, I mean, farmers,
farmers are, are plumbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers are carpenters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers are electricians.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're everything, you know,
they learn how to do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned how to do a lot myself,
um, gardening and being a renter because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't just call your landlord if
something goes wrong, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned a lot of stuff, uh,
on my own and it's kind of a blessing in
[SPEAKER_01]: disguise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the, in that time I was,
you know, stressing out like, Oh no,
[SPEAKER_01]: my basement's flooding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's soil in the sump pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to like clean this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got to work in, you know,
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, uh, you know, learning how to deal
with electricity and just everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's been so valuable, you know,
cause now I'm, I'm renovating my attic and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using these skills that I learned,
um, that I, that I never learned
[SPEAKER_01]: previously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's kind of cool, but I wanted
to, I wanted to reverse back to odor
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's kind of like a
controversial thing, uh, that we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about and that's ozone generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never, I didn't even put those in our
notes, but ozone generators, we don't sell
[SPEAKER_01]: them on happy hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, I don't really know what,
if they're dangerous, if they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: dangerous, I don't know the interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done a deep dive on,
on ozone generators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you may have, or you may have a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not never used one, not very familiar
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search for it on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see there's one for 65 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word ozone generator sounds kind of
scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like is it generating ozone in
my house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like should I be breathing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, um, I don't really know,
but I know that people, I have been in a
[SPEAKER_01]: house where people have been using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do cover up odors, but I think,
uh, before anybody goes and uses those,
[SPEAKER_01]: they should kind of look into the,
you know, whether or not they're safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, you know, if they're selling them
on Amazon, you would assume like that
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon would do their due diligence,
but you know, I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a debate and that's why I
don't list them on our website because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to steer clear of any
controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a good question for the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ozone generators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has anybody used them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any experience with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to light real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you had a good story in regards to
light leaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a few, which one do you want the
basement one?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a guy who, uh, I worked at the
local grow shop, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of how I got my,
my in, um, into this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing some growing on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I went and I just started hanging out
at the grow shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got, they got a shipment delivered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started, you know, the one day the owner
was busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just grabbed a razor knife, started
putting stuff on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even work there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it got me a job there and you know,
I met all these people in this one guy
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in, everyone's telling stories,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause back then, um, you know,
there is just less internet, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow stores where you hung out and
shared all your stories had to keep things
[SPEAKER_01]: on the low sky is telling a story about
how him and his buddy rented a house and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're growing in the basement and they
get it all set up and they're using some
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand watt HPS lights, maybe a couple
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They finish up, you know, it's like one in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just spent, you know, six,
seven, eight hours building this grow
[SPEAKER_01]: room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got, you know, the plants and
everything they go outside and they go to
[SPEAKER_01]: get in their cars to leave and they look
back at the house and there's light just
[SPEAKER_01]: pouring out of the foundation through
every single crack and hole, just bright
[SPEAKER_01]: yellow light pouring out of the
foundation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, dude, what did you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, well, I didn't sleep that night
for one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, luckily there was like a 24 seven
Walmart or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, they went and they bought,
you know, 10 cans of great stuff that like
[SPEAKER_01]: foam spray and they went around the whole
thing and just had to basically fill in
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole foundation, the whole four feet
of foundation sticking out from the ground
[SPEAKER_01]: to where the first floor of the house
starts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to seal it all up in the middle
of the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I was just like, wow,
man, that is just imagine that imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: like putting in all those hours,
getting everything set up, you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: your car, you're like, you're feeling
like, yeah, dude, we're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just look over coming out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gotta be a rare thing though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he said it was cracking the
foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that they're bigger problems
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what if water, water leaking in there
too, like flood in the basement,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's cracks or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably, you know, I mean, uh,
I think, uh, I think when he's,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think when this guy was looking for a
house to rent, he was looking for cheap
[SPEAKER_01]: rent and he wasn't really thinking about,
you know, the quality of the foundation
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, obviously he didn't even,
he didn't even line the walls with poly or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just grew it, you know, which a lot of
people would say is a big no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but everyone's a beginner at some
point, so you make mistakes, you figure it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, um, hopefully you learn fast
and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went around and they spray,
spray foamed it all in and got it all
[SPEAKER_01]: sealed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that was, that was a funny one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely something to keep your eye
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's somewhat unexpected, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking for your light leaks,
going outside, just pretending,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretending you are your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are your thoughts when you
look at the house?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it look like a house that is there
light leaking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I had another guy who used to come in
and you know, the, the, the one day it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in, he's like, you know,
talking about clones and this and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he wants to trade some clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go over to his house, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get out of my car.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, dude, I could smell it from the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was kind of in the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the neighbors weren't on top of each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could smell it through from the road,
dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was, you know, back in the day,
it's not cool, not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, uh, you know, I go in and I'm like,
dude, dude, I could smell that from a
[SPEAKER_01]: road.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks at me and just meh.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what about like, he's like,
nobody comes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, what are your mailman?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about like the pizza guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what if a neighbor like knocks on your
door?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That guy ended up getting in a little bit
of trouble actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because of that reason there were no,
he didn't use any carbon filters and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so yeah, kind of a bummer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That reminds me of a story when you were
over my house and we were trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: you help trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your, your help there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, I love trimming, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to sit down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to sit down for 16 hours,
but we were sitting down trimming and we
[SPEAKER_00]: got, we actually live streaming this too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is back when I, I live stream
trimming and I had my Mr. Groward shirt on
[SPEAKER_00]: and I get a knock on the door and we're
trimming probably 15 feet from the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, obviously the whole house stinks,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a fresh harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually trimming at that point,
but this, it's still stinks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole house stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned before, I opened up the
door and I, I quickly exit the door
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know it stinks on the inside and
the FedEx guy is there and he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, here's a sign for this package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he looks at my shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He noticed my shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Oh, that's what that smell is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean he knew who you were from
YouTube?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I think he just like my logo has
like the leaf on it and grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like he put two and two together
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, it was kind of awkward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I signed for the package and then went in
there and I was like, man, this smells
[SPEAKER_00]: escaping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had friends and stuff come over
before and like, dude, I can smell it from
[SPEAKER_00]: the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh God, you know, so it's like,
sometimes I feel like I do need to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: better job of hiding the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's only really been though
harvest, you know, when I'm drying things
[SPEAKER_00]: are harvested, things are hanging for dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's when it really,
really stinks because what's in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's in flower, I do have the exhaust
going up into my attic and out the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't really smell it down at
street level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm harvesting, I'm trimming on a
floor level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well then, um, yeah, unfortunately it
escapes all the way to the road for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, next time we're just, we'll have to
go in your attic crumped up in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I, I, one of my notes here was,
um, you know, if you're, if you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: place and you're, you're kind of towing a
line and you're, you got your smell under
[SPEAKER_01]: control and it's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're, you got it under control while
you're, uh, opening the tent, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, when it comes to that
trimming and harvesting, it's really hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so sometimes the best move is to just
take it somewhere else, trim it somewhere
[SPEAKER_01]: else, you know, um, because it's,
it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can, you could keep your negative
pressure and you can keep carbon filter
[SPEAKER_01]: going and everything, but you know,
one small mistake, you open the door,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, and it's just, so if you can
take it somewhere else to trim and harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff, that's safe and safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's secure and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's an option too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause at that point it's really hard to
hide it from your roommates or family
[SPEAKER_00]: members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we talk about that next,
you know, how do you hide it from your
[SPEAKER_00]: roommates or family members, people living
in the same house as you, how would you go
[SPEAKER_00]: about hiding it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is tough, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a good time for one of my,
one of my friends, Ryan has this really
[SPEAKER_01]: good quote and the quote is there's
nothing sketchier than a sketchy guy act
[SPEAKER_01]: and sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number one thing is the don't act
sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number two thing is if you're living
with people who are like aware,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably going to have a really
tough time to, to hide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't, I don't want to say it's
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not impossible, but it's going to be
really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one of the, one of the ways that
people are doing it, and I kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered this when I was, um,
refreshing for this, this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got these things called space
buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you end up checking that website out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of space buckets and I saw that
website you sent me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, I never heard of those and I was
looking at them and there's a whole Reddit
[SPEAKER_01]: community about space buckets and people
are taking five gallon buckets and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just growing like one little plant in this
five gallon bucket and they've got,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, they'll hook up a fan and a carbon
filter to it and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that's an actual realistic
way, um, to grow at home without people
[SPEAKER_01]: you're living with noticing if you're
going to, if you're going to take a stab
[SPEAKER_01]: at it, but still, you know, you might
have, you might just have to trim and
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest somewhere else unless you can
really figure out the carbon filter,
[SPEAKER_01]: negative pressure or long room type
strategy for the odors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than the space buckets, you know,
back in the day they were, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: these like, uh, fake computer boxes they
used to sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't even come with a carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was just like, uh, there's just like
a, a regular computer fan on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they just can't even imagine
how many of those sold, uh, back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like even with something like that,
like it's just going to leak smell right
[SPEAKER_01]: out the back and it's tough to control
odors with a quiet fan too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the reason you got to use those
inline fans, uh, with the carbon filters
[SPEAKER_01]: is because a regular like booster fan,
a small quiet fan doesn't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: power to get the air through the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the carbon restricts the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The airflow so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you got to use one of those
powerful fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I would say, I would say this,
if you know when someone at your house is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be home, those are the times
where you want your light off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you want your fan on a low setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and those things go hand in hand,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're, when your lights on,
your fan usually has to be on at a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: setting to control the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the lights off, you can keep the fan
or lower setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting a, you're solving the
light problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: By just having it off during those period,
during that time, uh, you get the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: noise from the fan, but it's obviously
it's still on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get your negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're not using a, a space bucket
or kind of some little homemade hidden
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, you know, they've got like stealth
closets and all this stuff that some of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty gimmicky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but you know, if you're going to use a
regular like two by four grow tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe you can play it off as a
clothing, just look, it's just a portable
[SPEAKER_01]: closet, clothing closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how long you get away with
that for, but you know, you can try the
[SPEAKER_01]: owner blocks and stuff like that,
but even that might be a little weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, Hey, why is, uh,
why is our one roommates room always smell
[SPEAKER_01]: like this weird block odor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, or like, so it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some things that you can do to
make it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, reducing the amount of things that
you're bringing in and out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like trying to reuse your soil or
cocoa, buying things, keeping it small,
[SPEAKER_01]: buying things in small quantities,
you know, re reusing your, your,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, delivery boxes, um, to put things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can just, you know, waltz them in
and, and it's not some like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sketchy black garbage bag or whatever,
things like that, you know, you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to, or you're going to
have a really tough time trying to lug a
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 tank by when you got roommates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so just keeping it small and maybe,
maybe this doesn't have to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: roommates, but you really have to be
careful about who you tell and who you
[SPEAKER_01]: trust, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every friend has a friend that they tell
your secrets to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's like a few friends in
everyone's life where they can like
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely trust, but for the most part,
every best friend has a best friend and
[SPEAKER_01]: secrets just get shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to, uh, choose who
you're, who you're telling about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and I guess like, I guess the
final kind of thing to talk about when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to roommates is, is, is,
are you a good roommate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you being a good roommate to your
roommates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, uh, clean up after yourself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you respect them with not having it
stinky and not being noisy or whatever?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it can go a long way, especially,
you know, if say you are growing and your
[SPEAKER_01]: roommate eventually finds it and you may
not want to even do that without talking
to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, but if you already did,
and then they find out later and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: mad at you that it might not be as bad if
you were a good roommate beforehand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you're, if you're a pain in the
butt and you don't have a good
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with your roommates and then,
and then they find out that you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're going to be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, my, my note was the compromise,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think that's the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can compromise with your roommates,
ahead of time and be honest and upfront
[SPEAKER_01]: with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just don't have to hide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it might be harder to do that with
your mom or your family, but that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, that's kind of my thought process on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with neighbors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're a good neighbor and you're
nice and you're friendly and something
[SPEAKER_01]: goes wrong or whatever, they get,
they get annoyed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're going to come and knock on
your door and give you a heads up before
[SPEAKER_01]: they do anything crazy or, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when it comes to keeping it
stealthy, stealth from family,
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, roommates, you know, people
living with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know plenty of people have kind of built
out sections in their closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They built sections of basement and their
attic to where they've kind of boxed off
[SPEAKER_00]: areas, a garage as well, but they've
really boxed off an area and made it so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really see there's a door
anywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a stealth door that they,
they're able to kind of open up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, hiding the smell and light
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, finding a section in the home to
where you can kind of box off and prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody from even realizing that there's
a, an area there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's probably one of the most
common ways to hide it from family or
[SPEAKER_00]: roommates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually reminds me of a,
of a guy, um, a different guy from the
[SPEAKER_01]: girl shop, who's I had the pleasure of
going to his house and he had a,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, he had a work batch that he had built,
you know, and it had a big giant back on
[SPEAKER_01]: it that he hung all his tools on,
but it was on caster wheels, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: caster wheels were hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a, with like a two by six in front of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, you looking at it,
you don't even know it's on wheels,
[SPEAKER_01]: but then he, he goes up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He pulls it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It opens up behind it is a poly zipper
door and boom, you walk in and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Whoa, dude, it was, it was really
cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like some 007.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many creative things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a whole, there's probably
a whole Reddit section on keeping it
[SPEAKER_00]: stealth or gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine because people get creative and
it comes down to the DIY thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you'd mentioned before, kind of
learning how to do things yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fun, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like when I saw that door,
I was like, uh, are we going to Harry
[SPEAKER_01]: Potter land?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, am I going to end up at what's on
the other side here?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there any other tips for keeping it
stealth when growing indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget about the smell of your
nutrients and soil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who's walked in a growth store,
you know, you know that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are organic nutrients and soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they might not smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the medicinal plants, but it's,
it's got a strong odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keeping those things in your tent,
if you have room or just in a place that
[SPEAKER_01]: has a odor control, it's definitely a good
idea to having one of your buddies come
[SPEAKER_01]: over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what you're doing and just
having them like, Hey, I want you to just
[SPEAKER_01]: walk into my house and just like,
just pretend like you just don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want you to, to let me know,
like, is there anything, do you smell
[SPEAKER_01]: anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you hear anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to get the, the input of
someone else, because if you're hanging
[SPEAKER_01]: out there all the time, you know,
it might not smell to you, but it might
[SPEAKER_01]: smell to someone who's not hanging out in
an indoor garden all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, the being aware of the nutrients
and the smell, particularly with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a good one there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used build a soil craft blend for
many, many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, one of the things in there,
I think it's the, it's the fish meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like really, like once I do that top
dressing those first couple of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: it really, really stinks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can kind of cause a red flag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's often overlooked, you know,
you don't even think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause there's so many different moving
parts and stuff that you are thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's easy to overlook that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But another one I have here is traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really don't want, people coming in
and out of your house, uh, all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's where you're gardening,
uh, for many, many different reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's a, there's a,
another good quote, don't poop where you
[SPEAKER_01]: eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that kind of applies to
that really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then something else, uh, emergencies,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't really talk about emergencies
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, Oh no, the water meter guy
wants to come in and take a reading off my
[SPEAKER_01]: water meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm seven weeks into fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you gotta have a plan for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you should have, uh, you should have
an emergency plan, uh, written out and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, everyone who lives with you
should, should know what the plan is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you can enact it if the water guy
does have to come in or, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and sometimes, you know,
that's when you just light up and the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole place just smells like a cloud
instead of, uh, instead of an active
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say, Oh, maybe your plan includes
getting everything out of the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a guy told me a story once that,
um, I forget what happened, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: his landlord or whatever, like had to come
to the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: He took all the plants out of the
basement, put them on the roof and just
[SPEAKER_01]: had them on the roof of the house while
the guy was working in the basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, that seems risky, but it
worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a funny one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, another thing related to emergencies
is if you're using like any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: automated watering systems, or you have
like a reservoir of water going or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that, um, making sure that
you're protected from floods.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last thing you want to do is have a
flood from your irrigation system or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you know, ruin the floor,
just create any problem that you may have
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with your, your landlord or
whatever, just anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most grotens come with a flood tray,
which is pretty suitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think they come up what four to
six inches on each edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, they can hold a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but if you're doing like a whole
bedroom or something, you can get giant
[SPEAKER_01]: tarps, fold them in half, run them up the
walls a little bit, uh, nail two by fours
[SPEAKER_01]: to the walls around to hold it up,
you know, and then you just have a big
[SPEAKER_01]: giant flood barrier essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, it's really just an
insurance policy dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously we know like there's a lot of
humidity that comes with gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, your water in the plants, they're,
it can just, you can get a real human
[SPEAKER_01]: environment real easily and, and that can
damage drywall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can damage paint, um, if it's not under
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're renting a place and you want
to get your security deposit back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to want to ruin the
paint, the drywall and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a dehumidifier and just keeping,
you know, keeping that on your mind,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is another, is another big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and on that topic, say you got to
screw a bunch of stuff to the ceiling and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you don't want to damage the ceiling
or you got to screw a bunch of stuff to
[SPEAKER_01]: the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just screw a two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're putting one, two,
three, four screws in maybe five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six screws in to the two by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can screw things to the two
by four without damaging, uh, the wall
[SPEAKER_01]: behind as much, you know, maybe it doesn't
have anything to do with stealth growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for getting your security deposit back
and just having less, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanup work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great points there on keeping
things stealth when gardening indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, I appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm sure there's things that we missed
and that we're going to be told in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to read those comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we missed anything, if you have any
advice for how to keep things stealth,
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it down in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love reading through all the comments
and, uh, yeah, some really good stuff in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'm sure somebody will mention
the electric bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't mention that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't talk about electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are worried about the electric bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we don't have to go into it,
but I can tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't steal power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these days with the lights being so
efficient, I mean, if you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, I think my bill when I'm running two
tents is like 30 bucks a month,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so it's not too brutal back in
the day when you're running thousand Watts
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're running four or five,
six lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that adds up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's hundreds of dollars per month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easily.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those little ballots use more amps than
the led, um, ballots are using nowadays
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not as important these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell the listeners how they can find you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?

what dimmer percent, and it'll estimate
[SPEAKER_01]: how far to keep it from the plants based
on that stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, we've got all sorts of stuff
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, I could, I could go on for a half
