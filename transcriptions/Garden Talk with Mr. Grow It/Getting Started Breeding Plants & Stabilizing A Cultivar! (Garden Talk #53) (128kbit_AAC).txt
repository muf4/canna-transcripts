[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start throwing things into the
mix and just kind of chucking pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: around and kind of getting away from the
grand vision of what you actually enjoy
[SPEAKER_00]: and want to keep carrying on, that's when
you're going to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purple thing is something that you
wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then yes, that's something that I would
try to take into consideration when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what a lot of people don't know is
that pollen can be extremely volatile and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can become infertile very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a mix of your two
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've now collided them together and
you're going to get potentially the best
[SPEAKER_00]: of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for things like fast flowering
time, resistance to white powder mildew,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well they can handle the cold,
also how well they can handle the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's still going to get hot here
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't eat the vegetable or whatever
it is at the end because it's all filled
[SPEAKER_00]: with bugs or the plant was diseased and
didn't finish it, then it basically isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: any good anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody?

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Graham,
but some of you may know him as Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaf Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are going well over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously by the name, I'm up in Canada,
so I was doing a little bit of shoveling
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, it's been a chill
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just shoveling so I could get my groceries
and now I'm here hanging out with Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is always awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad to have you on board today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are going to talk about plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of getting started plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a lot of people out
there who are interested and haven't taken
[SPEAKER_01]: that step yet in order to do it,
or they just started doing it and they
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of need some more information on
which way to go because there are,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there are several different
ways you can go when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several different techniques and
ways you can stabilize strains and so on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So also stabilizing a cultivar is kind of
what we'll get into today as well as we go
[SPEAKER_01]: along here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, how about an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening and
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got into gardening and breeding
probably from my mother at a very early
[SPEAKER_00]: age.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was licensed by Health Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: She provided medicine for people who
couldn't grow it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how I initially got into growing
and learning about all kinds of plants was
[SPEAKER_00]: just because my mother had like a very,
you know, sort of self driven kind of take
[SPEAKER_00]: on life where she wanted to be able to
supply her own own, whether it be food or
[SPEAKER_00]: food or medicine or a drink or whatever it
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was how I originally got into
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that sort of picked up into
wanting to be able to share some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that she did back in the early days
with other people, which is what led into
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian Leap Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's kind of how I've gotten to
where I am today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mostly goes a lot to my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad was involved a little bit too,
but mostly to my mom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, she really brought that the green
thumb out of me and brought me to this
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of breeding point where I am today
where I wanted to bring that back and
[SPEAKER_00]: share it with people so that they could
have success growing different cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: in Canada because as you know,
it's kind of hard up here if you're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow and complete a season,
you know, regardless of whatever plant it
[SPEAKER_00]: is you're growing, you might run into the
same issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned before we started
recording that you have been breeding for
[SPEAKER_01]: about five years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many different cultivars have you
created so far?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think on the website, I've got
probably six specific different cultivars
[SPEAKER_00]: on there that I would say are completely
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if you get them, it's going to
grow exactly what it's supposed to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to what I had intended for it to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's six on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd have to double check, but pretty sure
if I recall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm working on another one right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be about seven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it takes a long time to actually
get them to the point to point where
[SPEAKER_00]: something is stabilized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was lucky having things that were
[SPEAKER_00]: initially were sort of just being pollen
chucked around from my mother,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that would be going back into the
early years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've brought it kind of back in
the last five years and sort of fine tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of those into becoming those six
that are on the website.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when somebody decides to start
breeding, what are the first steps?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are they to identify two different
cultivars that they want to cross?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the first steps here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first things you're going to want
to do is you're going to find like your
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it your two favorite plants,
whether each each cultivar might be
[SPEAKER_00]: different to like maybe you get your
favorite is in the female side or your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites in the male side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But try to have them both be your
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have to grow regular
seeds in order for this to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to grow unless
you you want to use a female that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: grown from a feminine sized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you'd be able to utilize your
favorite female or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you know that that's that's a
pretty stable strain, you could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: use that as a good base starting point,
as long as it's one of your favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to need regular
seeds in order to get your male.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when you're going to make sure
that that's also one of your favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: things, too, because if you start
combining something that's not your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorite into there or doing something
that's not going to work in your climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be something that takes has a
longer growing period or isn't as
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant to cold or things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you add that into the mix on top of
even that nice, maybe feminized female
[SPEAKER_00]: seed that is your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're going to be sad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're always going to want to make
sure that everything you choose at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning is your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything, whatever whatever
works for you and it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that you're choosing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have an OK start,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you start throwing things into the
mix and just kind of chucking pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: around and and and not really and kind of
getting away from the grand vision of what
[SPEAKER_00]: you actually enjoy and want to want to
keep carrying on, that's when you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just getting started,
choose things that are your favorite and
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure you continue to choose those
each time you breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to start with two that
are your favorite and and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: counts for the male, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just chuck a pollen in there just to
create seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I couldn't help a laugh here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your cat jumped up on your lap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a cat on my lap, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, yeah, these cats that are
laughing at the party.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so the question I had actually
for that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it better to start with stable genetics
to begin with, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, say somebody finds a prize
phenol, like female, but it's an F2 or
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we actually did a another
episode where we talk about what F1s are.
[SPEAKER_01]: F2s are basically just different
generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, the further you go
down, the more stable you kind of are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except for F2, it kind of opens up the
gene pool a little bit and see more
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So F2 is one of the bigger ones as far as
like the characteristics you can
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you start with an F2, is that going
to be less, you know, not as ideal
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to if you're starting with like
an F4 and F5, something that's more
[SPEAKER_01]: stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess it would depend on what
trait it was that you were looking for and
[SPEAKER_00]: how important it was for you to have that
specific trait carried on over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because regardless of what you breed it
with, unless you're breeding like folio,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is like breeding within the actual
like lines of like the family genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: like breeding kind of like brother and
sister together.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you get outside of that,
you're kind of starting all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some regard, like, I don't know if
that makes sense.
It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a little bit too confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, like if you were to breed
outside of the family lines again,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, you're just going to kind of start
back over and you've now created another
[SPEAKER_00]: F1 again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it would assuming that the male is
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always important to start with
stable genetics regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, for the first one, you always
want to start make sure you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: stable genetics and not, again,
not kind of just chucking pollen around
[SPEAKER_00]: and making things work, like make sure
both plants are good and suit what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see further on down the line while
you do your folio breeding to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: really pull out those traits and solidify
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so what is meant by stable genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in terms of a particular stable
genetics, like when it only it does
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's if I wanted the plant to be
purple and grow one foot tall each time
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a specific sort of flowering
thing and a specific terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, that would be a stable
genetic, assuming that it did that 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent or very close to 100 percent of
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would say it's pretty stable
if it's getting like 90 percent of the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool if you get a funny one in there
that still represents the plant in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the genetics are supposed to,
but maybe slightly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, stable genetics should be
something that's 100 percent or very close
[SPEAKER_00]: to 100 percent and replicates the same
thing, almost like a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so they have their two cultivars,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the two cultivars that they want
to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say for this example, you have the
male and the female of two different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two different cultivars you want to cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, oftentimes they're going to first
phenohunt, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe they're planting a batch of
seeds, you know, 10 pack, 20 pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the amount of seeds they're going
to plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're hunting through looking for
those traits from that cultivar that they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to then pass on to the kind of this
new hybrid, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have two different cultivars
that you're crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end result would be hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you look for in female plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the characteristics that you're
looking for in order to kind of see if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's something, a keeper that you want
to breed with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's subjective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes by breeder to breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you, what would you say you kind of
look for in female plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me specifically, again,
this is something that would come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not that particular cultivar
stable or not right to when you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, because you'd be able to see like,
oh, all my, all of it's looking the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This obviously I'm working with something
that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I put this with, with another
stable, something else is going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to combine and I'm going to
have to work with that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully both of them are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it's me looking for it in
particular, and I'm working with genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: that need to be resistant to frost,
they've usually got, I need them to finish
[SPEAKER_00]: probably at least by October 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at a shorter growing
period than you, than most people would
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm looking for things like fast
flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for things like resistance to
white powdered mildew, how they,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well they can handle the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also how well they can handle the heat
because it's still going to get hot here
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are some things I can replicate,
but also a lot of that comes with testing
[SPEAKER_00]: them outside as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both things have to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also a way that you're going to
find whether or not your genetics are
[SPEAKER_00]: stable and working in environments,
if you get a similar result growing inside
[SPEAKER_00]: and outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are some of the things that I
look for is definitely a short flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: time, resistance to cold, white powdered
mildew, resistance to insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I look at potency and
things like terpene profile and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else, because if you can't eat the
vegetable or whatever it is at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's, it's all filled with bugs or
the plant was diseased and didn't finish
[SPEAKER_00]: it, then it's, it's, it basically isn't
any good anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, all of those things come second
to me, but they still have to be top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're growing out the females,
are you cloning them prior to flipping the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and then competing the female grow,
you have your clones on the side and then
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're picking one and then
you're, you know, keeping that clone that
[SPEAKER_01]: you had, or are you growing them out,
then monster cropping to bring it back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the veg stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually do neither of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually, when I'm doing my breeding,
I breed filial and I breed, I'll put two
[SPEAKER_00]: of them together, two of my favorites,
and then I'll work through those lines to
[SPEAKER_00]: create the stable genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't usually ever do any cloning or
monster cropping or things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: not because I'm against it for any reason,
but I like to start from each seed because
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that each seed is
going to be the same whenever somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else grows it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to test the stability that way,
but in terms of breeding as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I always take, I always start from a
seed and grow it and make sure it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it fits all the categories that I want it
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll also grow my male and I'll
have this growing at the same time so that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can determine flowering times and things
like that between both of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: both male and female, so that I can see if
that they're doing the same things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: want so that whenever I breed those
together, it's going to result in
[SPEAKER_00]: something similar down the line,
as well as combining traits together that
[SPEAKER_00]: might be different, but also work
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the females are growing,
you're actually, you have a male growing
[SPEAKER_01]: alongside and you're pollinating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you grow them all out,
you're smoking them, and then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: picking your, your keeper from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those, you'll have seeds already
available for your keeper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally like when I'm like,
when you're starting with a stable
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, usually you've already grown a
few to, to know that you, that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: you enjoy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's the main thing you want to do
before you even, before anybody ever
[SPEAKER_00]: decides like, Oh, I'm going to breed this
one and I'm going to breed this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't even grown it before you,
you shouldn't even do it at all because
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So grow a bunch first and then find out
that, you know, that, okay, in this,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this cultivar, in this particular one,
I, it has things that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go ahead and grow that because
when this is going to lead into probably
[SPEAKER_00]: something we're going to talk about later,
I'm sure in this video, Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is when is a good time to pollinate
your female plant and when is a good time
[SPEAKER_00]: to harvest your seeds afterwards and how
to get the best result in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, so that's, that's part of
the reason why I do it that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they're at a particular stage of
growth, both of them, so that I can
[SPEAKER_00]: visually see how the male's growing and
how the female's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and usually I know how this plant
works and, and in this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar, which you all should know if
you're going to get into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to want to try to
grow it to make sure that it's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to do before you start, because
you're not going to be able to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever you breed it is, is what we're
going to get into talking about later on
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to waste a whole time,
a whole plant and two plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, depending on how you do it,
because you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke the pollinated female because
there's going to be way too much seed
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So flipping over to the male plants side
of things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you mentioned that you're,
you're, you're combining the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming you're planting them all at
once, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're planting all these seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to, you're going to have your
males and you're going to have your
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you look for in male plants for
selection?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in male plants is much the same,
but it's harder to, this is again,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're, you're kind of, you're not
guessing, but you're going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of a less chance to determine,
for example, like terpene profile or
[SPEAKER_00]: potency, obviously, or you know,
flowering time, you can tell like those
[SPEAKER_00]: are, those are, that's the kind of
difference I mean, because you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can watch the plant grow obviously,
but you're not going to be able to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really, it's not going to have
the same smell that you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: from a female that's produced the
resonant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyways, you get, you guys get where
I'm going with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I look for when I'm doing it is
still the same way the flowering structure
[SPEAKER_00]: is how close those nodes spacing is
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if this is your, this is your plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And each knuckle is where a new flower is
going to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how small is that space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get tight branching flowers
or am I going to get flowers that are
[SPEAKER_00]: spaced far apart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to get a different kind of
growth structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a bush?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be extra, extra tall or
things like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally male plants are usually more
tall than female because they're usually
[SPEAKER_00]: towering over the plant and they want to
spread their pollen down onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally males are almost always
bigger, but that's not always,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes not always the case as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to take that, those sorts of
things into consideration, but those are
[SPEAKER_00]: things I look for growth structure,
flower spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can rub the stock and get a
smell that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last thing would be just like
actual flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how quick does it take it to start
producing pollen and for those pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sacks to actually open up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of people don't know that
like you could have a male well into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and have all kinds of pollen sacks,
but it's not actually, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: explain unless you've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure that maybe, maybe you've seen
it Chris, maybe other people have seen out
[SPEAKER_00]: there too, but it takes a long time for
those pollen sacks to actually open for
[SPEAKER_00]: that pollen to be spread around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have a male, you know,
clearly it's a male for two, three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: before you're into trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the things I look for growth
structure, flowering time and flower node
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing when it starts to produce those
flower sacks, because that's going to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you how that's going to translate into
your female's flower spacing, as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: color, obviously if it's got purple leaves
or it's got a purple stock or things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm actually working on a cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the brisker or Gmail with
a Pakistan Valley female.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, one of the things that I'm
growing out the F2 is I grew in an F2
[SPEAKER_01]: recently and it was a little bit more
stretchier than I wanted it to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bud stacking wasn't as close together
that I wanted it to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: inter nodal spacing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, that'd be the other term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm, so what I should probably
look for and give me guidance otherwise,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think otherwise is, you know,
for males, if I'm looking for maybe the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the shorter males, faster flowering,
if I'm looking for, you know, just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: speed up the flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can look for that stem rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done stem rubs before and kind of
making sure that I get what I want there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemony type smell is kind of what I've
chosen so far on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to make sure that's repeatable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each stem is going to have a different
smell, but again, you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge variance, but it's going to be kind
of specific to the cultivar you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you kind of know you're going to
have an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And should, for males, for males,
should I also be looking at like frost
[SPEAKER_01]: production on it or like coloring at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some, I've had some males that have,
you know, the pollen sacks have actually
[SPEAKER_01]: turned a little bit purple, like purple in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those things that could potentially
get passed on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we're going to get into dominant
versus recessive here in a minute or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all those things can be passed
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things could get passed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's something that I think is
very cool is that the dominant and
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive trade and the talks about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's a lot of other people
that have far more knowledge on it than I
[SPEAKER_00]: do, but it's something that I think is
very cool and is different probably
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on which plants you're looking
at as a whole, as just plants in an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: species.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, is that purple that you
experienced in the flower going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: passed on to the female as a dominant
trait?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to become that all the time if
you picked that male for whatever reason?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that only going to show up
sometimes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it going to be a recessive trait that's
sort of locked into the gene pool but
[SPEAKER_00]: hidden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have to sort of look for it
throughout it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would assume that if that if
the purple thing is something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted, then yes, that's something that I
would try to take into consideration when
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for a male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've been trying to do this
thing where I pulled on like purple
[SPEAKER_00]: colors, like it has a purple stock,
which is kind of unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted to pull that over and I was
having trouble and it seems that it only
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up certain times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure having a purple stock
is a recessive trait as where a purple
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf seems as soon as you breed a plant
that's got purple leaf so with another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's green, the offspring all seem
to have purple colorings of some sort,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not a purple stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I was trying to look
into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure exactly how that would in
your situation work with the purple male.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have to try ultimately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it was something that you wanted to
avoid, then I would not try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically is what it comes down to because
you don't want to add that into the gene
[SPEAKER_00]: pool regardless of whether or not it's
dominant or recessive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it means it could start showing up
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you've selected your male and
female, let's talk about the pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know you're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned you referenced outdoors and
how you're kind of putting them together
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips for the pollination
process outdoors and then indoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's people who like collect
pollen and then they'll pollinate at a
[SPEAKER_01]: later date.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain day in flowering where
you feel it's kind of best to pollinate in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to maximize the yield of seeds that
are created?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of those things where I'm
testing the cultivars outside to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're doing what I want them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's part of the way that I test to
make sure that they're kind of the stable
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of my breeding happens inside so
that I can make sure that exactly what I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get bred is being bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have to worry about,
again, having pollen chucked around or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything weird like that happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly which male is mating with
which female.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know exactly which one is
pollinating the other one, I know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to really generally worry about
cross pollination or things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm doing it in an enclosed
environment in a specific area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've worked with pollen before,
you know that it's quite easy to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each calyx, each little hair on the plant
can receive pollen from the male and that
[SPEAKER_00]: will become your seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's easy for that transfer to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what a lot of people don't know is
that pollen can be extremely volatile and
[SPEAKER_00]: it can become infertile very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally what I like to do is I just
like to, again, this helps if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing them side by side and it helps if
you're got them in an enclosed area and
[SPEAKER_00]: you only have the pair in there because
generally I'll grow them out and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: choose specifically which ones show the
traits the best that I want them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might all show the traits,
but I want the ones specifically that show
[SPEAKER_00]: it the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'll put in my enclosed
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I go to pollinate, I watch the male,
see how long it takes for it to start
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point in time, it's really easy to
just like, you could either take the male
[SPEAKER_00]: and shake it over top of the female or
shake the female into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to end up happening is it's
going to become so pollinated anyways that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not going to be able to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the idea is because you've grown this
cultivar so many times or you should have
[SPEAKER_00]: at this point, you'll know that the female
that you've chosen is going to be okay and
[SPEAKER_00]: the male that you've chosen is also going
to be okay because you have stable
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go to introduce your pollen,
however you choose to do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do it basically, again,
as I said, each calyx with the hair can
[SPEAKER_00]: receive pollen and become a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you want to look for in
your female as a good point in time to
[SPEAKER_00]: reference when to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if your female hasn't produced
enough calyxes and have enough hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to produce enough seed
because you probably don't want your male
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging around taking up the space
afterwards while your female is growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so it's just, I try to just
pollinate there and I always clip the top
[SPEAKER_00]: bud off and I keep it in a mason jar,
which goes directly into the freezer
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is not the most ideal way to
store male pollen, but it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: you about six months of storage,
maybe a little bit longer if you put in
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, which like flour from the pantry
flour, because I've done that before and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll kind of absorb any moisture because
that's what's going to make the pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: infertile or like not allow it to be
viable to pollinate your females.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not really like a specific day in
flower where you're kind of aiming for,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's probably cultivar specific to where
like you mentioned, there's enough pistols
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of showing to pollinate and have a
good enough yield of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, each one is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's going to kind of play
into flowering time of your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, if you have your male that's
ready to go and he's producing pollen and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's ready to pollinate, it depends on how
that that's a good sign that one's
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering quite fast compared to your
female if it's not covered in,
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have enough hairs to receive the
pollen in order to create enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if you want 10 or 100 seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go too long, what can end up
happening is that you won't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: time to actually allow these seeds to
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then that also is a lost cause
because if they don't end up maturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you've wasted all of this time and
then you don't have any seeds that are
[SPEAKER_00]: viable at the end to actually plant as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where there becomes a fine
balance of is it too early or is it too
[SPEAKER_00]: late?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always better to do it earlier in
the cycle so that you can at least have a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time for those to become mature and
viable as opposed to earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go obviously too early,
you're not going to get many seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't have a lot to play with
in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're working on the early stages,
you're going to want to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds and you don't want to go in with
just 10 seeds into a next generation isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give you a lot of, come on man,
isn't going to give you a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: phenohunting to do for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not going to have a lot of
options to choose from going into the next
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, which is not something you want to
set yourself up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've pollinated your female.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long should, like when should you
harvest the plant in order to maximize the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of yield you get of seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I know you don't
typically smoke the plants that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinated and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just let the plant go like,
you know, nine, 10, 11 weeks, like further
[SPEAKER_01]: than you typically would.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of make sure that the
seeds are, are developed enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we just talked about, um,
I kind of like to hit that sweet spot
[SPEAKER_00]: where I know I'm going to get quite a
large amount of seeds, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of the process I'm in, whether it's
creating a lot to be able to bring this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar to the public or am I just trying
to create, uh, like a small amount,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 500 so that I can work through those
500 and pull out the traits that I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: create the next generation as I'm working
to create it more stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if I'm trying to bring in more
seeds, I'll just wait a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it has more hairs and the flowers
has just become a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main key is, is that you never
want to pollinate without having at least
[SPEAKER_00]: two months left because it takes about
eight weeks roughly for a seed to mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least through all the tests that I've
done, at least if you leave yourself that
[SPEAKER_00]: much time, a flower or for at least the
plant, at least two months of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant growing, whatever it is,
two months of plant growing, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, if your plant has a 14 week
flowering cycle or however long the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle is, that'll buy you a
little bit of time to push that calyx
[SPEAKER_00]: production a little bit further so that
when you pollinate, you'll get more seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there's not really any exact time
other than the possibility that you could
[SPEAKER_00]: go too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then afterwards, like, like you said
earlier, I just leave it until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically at the very end where very end
of life can't push anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can almost see the seeds want to fall
out of the plant pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could knock them off if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's ideal because you're,
in my situation, the plant's going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: over a couple thousand seeds on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to pick through it to try
to, to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find the easiest way is actually throw
the whole plant in a Ziploc bag,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry it a lot, roll the whole thing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then you'll be able to,
it'll basically like separate the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've done tests before where you
don't want to know, you don't want to know
[SPEAKER_00]: the seeds far outweigh the plant matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're like, Oh, that was a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, I guess now you get to enjoy the
fruits of it afterwards, depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you choose to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's where it comes into play where,
where you don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, you, number one, aren't for sure
that you want those seeds in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number two, you aren't for sure that
you'd enjoy smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And number three, you better have some
extra stash hanging around because if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have any other growth space and
that's specifically what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: that harvest is going to kind of be a
little bit of a sad time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after you pollinate, you've harvested
the seeds, the offspring, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: F1, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an F1 generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put your two favorite cultivars
together, like they're in a beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: sample and we've created the F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you want to further stabilize
that you could actually plant those and do
[SPEAKER_01]: the same process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You would just repeat the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd pick a female, pick a male,
showing your desired traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would pollinate and then the offspring
of that would be an F2, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so how far, and that actually,
like I mentioned in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: that opens up the gene pool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get a greater variety in F2s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're going to get a mix of the
two things that you just, your two
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites, you've now collided them
together and you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially the best of both worlds in
this next generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to happen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's, and then it's up to,
in that particular one, you find your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites again and you keep repeating and
not so much your, this is when it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: time to pick exactly what you want in
terms of, in terms of growth down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you want to determine this plants
to outcome to be every time, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you got to choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I want it to be every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see as you breed
through F2 and F3 and F4, those choices
[SPEAKER_00]: that you've made are going to start
becoming more just dominant in the pool of
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each time you do it, you're going to see,
oh my gosh, it's way more purple than it
[SPEAKER_00]: was last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked two purple plants and now it's
way more purple than before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to continue on the purple is
the question that you need to ask yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: as the breed later at this point in time,
or do you need to take a step back and
[SPEAKER_00]: take away the purple?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all questions that kind of get
into what kind of choices you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: how you want the plant to basically be
when it's stable and what you want the end
[SPEAKER_00]: result to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going down generations F3, F4,
F5 become more and more stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point is the cultivar considered
stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on, on if you've thrown,
thrown it a genetic curve ball somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: down the line, or if each time you've been
specifically selecting those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that kind of, again,
that thing I just said about purple,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you just decided you wanted to do
two purple ones, for some reason you got
[SPEAKER_00]: like a couple of purple ones in your F2
for whatever reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for some reason you decided you wanted
to breed those two together for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, even though you were looking for a
green cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now in F3 you're like, Oh boy,
now like 75% of these are purple or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how am I going to get away from
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to have purple in my,
in my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're going to have to take a step
back, go back to where you introduced that
[SPEAKER_00]: purple and maybe even go step back further
and start from that seed pool,
[SPEAKER_00]: like never get rid of your seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can step back to the beginning
generation and then start all over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never got into this purple
scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why each, each time,
if you want it to be stable, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to choose specific traits that you
want to see and be very, very picky about
[SPEAKER_00]: those traits, especially in the first
first one to three generations until they
[SPEAKER_00]: start seeing those traits repeated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start seeing them repeated a
little bit more, you can kind of relax and
[SPEAKER_00]: then kind of fine tune that into maybe one
or two more things that you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: specific changes happen, whether it's you
want the plant to be a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well pick one that has everything in it
in, in F, in F4, for example, you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I want it to be just a little bit
bigger now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that's would be a genetic curve ball
that you're going to kind of throw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you make sure that it's not too far
off, like everything else is the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a giant, giant, giant male,
but it still has a purple stock or purple
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want a purple fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want purple for this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has purple stock, purple leaves,
purple flower, purple buds, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull that one in as your genetic curve
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it won't be so weird in your,
in your, in your next gene pool that
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully you'll start seeing purple,
everything still not green, but then there
[SPEAKER_00]: might be a few in there that are giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then find a giant female and the giant
male in your next generation to pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: giant part into your growing cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, but, but the idea is to be very
specific in those first, first generations
[SPEAKER_00]: to choose what you want, because if you're
not, and you're just kind of doing willy
[SPEAKER_00]: nilly like, Oh, this is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're just going to get that
whenever you go later on, like your next
[SPEAKER_00]: generation again, is just going to be kind
of random because you're just doing random
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as you're very specific in
choosing, um, traits that you want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: represented throughout, throughout the
plants, uh, family tree, then you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my two cents on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like as long as you, as long as you
continue to choose, um, traits that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, uh, are, are what you chose at the
beginning, it's going to keep,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep dominantly representing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you consider an F3 stable or now
that's too soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: F3 is a little bit too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's, I think it's F4 for me,
when you really start to see, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the fruits of your labor, so to speak,
come in from the next, from the past
[SPEAKER_00]: choices that you've made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then again, but that's also a
point where things could get screwed up,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you could throw it that genetic sort
of curve ball, and then you're kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: back into a spot where it's like,
that one was too different for whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why, because again,
things could be a little bit different in
[SPEAKER_00]: F3 or F4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you might have one that just for some
reason is a little bit different,
[SPEAKER_00]: just different enough that it screws
things up for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so then you might want to step back,
which would bring you into back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to pull in the original things
you used, cause you're kind of far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you could do that as well,
depending on how, on how, on, on how far
[SPEAKER_00]: off you've, you've done a genetic
manipulation, let's say, um, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about testing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So oftentimes breeders will send off their
seeds to a group of people, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for testing prior to releasing the seeds
to the public, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people should be testing these
genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before releasing to the public and do you
have any kind of best practices?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that, you know, different cultivars
are going to grow differently and
[SPEAKER_01]: different latitudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you doing anything like that to
where you're making sure it's shipped out
[SPEAKER_01]: different areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are growing in different areas
to kind of see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, for us, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to ship stuff to the East coast and
stuff to the West coast just to make sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: cause they're entirely different growing
environments, but I want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the same in this, in this,
in this scenario, you want to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm getting the same kind of,
I want the plant to be purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, we're just going to keep
going to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want the plant to be purple for whatever
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, if I ship it to both sides,
it better be purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it better grow right,
but it better be purple regardless of what
[SPEAKER_00]: spot it's in, because that shouldn't make
a difference on the color of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, again, there are some things that
could come into play, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, weather or location or things like
that, but that it then becomes not part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not talking about breeding at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want the purple to be genetic part
of the plant, not brought on by the
[SPEAKER_00]: weather or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yes, I ship things across to both
sides of the border.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I can't ship things to the
States or I'd haven't really had a good,
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out a good way to do that yet that
I feel safe about doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I could do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could start going down that road,
but otherwise it's really easy for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it in here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then like, again, if you're
talking about how many seeds to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is kind of brings you to that stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we were talking about it earlier on in
the video where we're talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: many seeds are you going to get from a
plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you only got 10 seeds, that's not a
very good spot to start because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not, you're not going to get a good enough
example from those 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to choose the best
out of the 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would start all over,
but that would never be, I wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: call that an F1 at that point,
even though it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just, you have too little of amount of
seeds to actually determine what genes or
[SPEAKER_00]: things could be found in the gene pool
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so let's say for this example,
you have a thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say we have a thousand seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You counted them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's annoying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably make seed counter things,
but I've counted it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you grow, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess if you grew a hundred of
them, then you would have grown 10% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would give you a good,
good chance to see like a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a good display of what's going on
within your gene pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it's only 10%, it's a hundred
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you a good idea of
what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, throughout the remainder of the seeds,
I probably would go a little bit further
[SPEAKER_00]: to say if you did a hundred to 50,
15%, depending on how, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how crazy you wanted to get with things,
you could test maybe 200, do 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the 10% somewhere in the
hundred to 200 range is going to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a good idea of what, what's going to
happen with the rest of the seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: what, what is available in the gene pool
anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sending out to testers each
generation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing F1s and then sending out
testers, F2 sending out, or are you like
[SPEAKER_01]: finding what you want and then sending out
at like F4, F5?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'll do pretty much all the work,
like let's say 90% of the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the final amount of the testing is
when I need to have that bulk amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds grown that I can't do quite by
myself, you know, whether it's having a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred done at once of one thing so that
I can make sure that it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not that I can't do it,
but I have other things happening too at
[SPEAKER_00]: the same time that it's hard to do to
just, as anyone would know, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: just grow a hundred of one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that I don't want to do it
myself, but what it also allows is to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if other people's growing methods or other
people's growing environments or things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that affect the traits that I've
chosen and how they interact with each
[SPEAKER_00]: other and whether, and how they interact
with the cultivar interacts with the
[SPEAKER_00]: grower, the environment all those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so no, I don't send out previous
generations, but I send out the specific
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that I'm kind of the one that I
think is the one when I fine tuned it all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one that I send out to kind of
have be mass tested at the time to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that it is the one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can go, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll do one more breeding of
exactly those specific traits,
[SPEAKER_00]: filial in that same with that cultivar
that I've had everyone test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then usually in that next one,
which will probably be like an F six or F
[SPEAKER_00]: five, depending on how I'm doing on,
if I've been lucky or, uh, I've worked
[SPEAKER_00]: working with cultivars that are,
are very generous to me in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: in that regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then yeah, it could be an F six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll, I'll make the F five that everyone's
tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that'll be the one that,
that, uh, gets put on the website and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could pick up and it's probably going to
be, 90% the same at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that was a pretty good recap
of kind of how to get started with
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding and stabilizing and definitely
covered a lot in a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you dropping the knowledge
this time around jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well in the future, right now I'm
working on, uh, breeding in an auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and a photo period together, which I know
is something we didn't get a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch on in this video, Chris,
but sometime in the future, maybe we can
[SPEAKER_00]: chat about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's what I'm working on right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably at the fourth generation and
I'm just starting to see some auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: traits come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also got some other cool things
like trifoliate going on, which is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: when you get an extra chromosome put in,
but this is getting into like way extra
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe another time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in that meantime, I'm just working
on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fine tuning it before I even get to
sending that or I've got to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're all auto flower, which is kind of
the cool part about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole different, uh, different ball
game cause you're changing the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, the way the, the way the plant
responds to light, um, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, other than that, you can just
find me again at the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can email me at Canadian leaf genetics
at gmail.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find me on the Instagram also
Canadian leaf genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'll do my best to respond to you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not very busy right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as you know, I'm up in, in Canada,
so it's winter time and I'm taking it easy
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are in Canada, get in touch
and I'd love to send you some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, but maybe in the future.
