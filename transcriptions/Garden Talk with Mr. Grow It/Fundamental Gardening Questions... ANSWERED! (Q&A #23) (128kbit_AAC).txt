[SPEAKER_00]: Question taking the defoliation leaves and
mixing them in with your soil that's
[SPEAKER_00]: cooking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do your thoughts I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before and had some good
results now You're gonna get people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to be against it hot composting
right here You're adding organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil that could eat up hurt roots
potentially I still do it and I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: had any issues that I Visible issues that
I can see so I definitely do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know It'll break down and become
usable nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a proponent of that Also proponent of
doing the chop and drop as defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: just dropping it right down in the medium
Having that as your mulch layer help
[SPEAKER_00]: retain moisture in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm a proponent of that Although
there are some people who are opposed it
[SPEAKER_00]: any good Black Friday deals on grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes There's definitely a lot of good deals
out there But one that comes to mind right
[SPEAKER_00]: away is from today's sponsor Mars Hydro if
you're a beginner They recommend their TS
[SPEAKER_00]: series LED grow lights for intermediate or
advanced growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their FCE series and they say
for them Masters out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at their FC or FC Evo series.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have budget-friendly lights dimmable,
you know from PPFD some have smart
[SPEAKER_00]: functions and some auto include their
high-efficient Samsung LM 301 H Evo diodes
[SPEAKER_00]: that Black Friday sale runs from November
9th to November 26th And they told me
[SPEAKER_00]: different products will pair on sale at
different times during that time frame So
[SPEAKER_00]: keep an eye out their website is
mars-hydro.com I'll put a link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been continuously using the same
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you run into excess had to test the
soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wearing the same batch of soil now for
five grows if I remember correctly I have
[SPEAKER_00]: not actually gone and done a soil test
It's generally recommended to do a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test between grow cycles Some people do a
soil test when we're going from veg to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower as well But getting a soil test can
be costly it adds up especially if you are
[SPEAKER_00]: getting consulting to have somebody
interpret the results for you and give you
[SPEAKER_00]: advice on what you need to imagine So I've
just been taking the gamble and just doing
[SPEAKER_00]: just amending on top of it And so I have
not actually run into any excess issues
[SPEAKER_00]: due to over fertilization I've just kind
of stuck with the 30-day rule where you
[SPEAKER_00]: know You're basically amending every 30
days and I use the fertilizer blends this
[SPEAKER_00]: round and last round I use kiss organics
nutrient pack one cup per plant 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: container for this I was using craft blend
same deal one cup per plant and every 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days and of course that Initial amending
that comes in there too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So but now long story short I have not run
into any excess issues Probably should
[SPEAKER_00]: send it out for a total soil test just to
see what it looks like, you know Just for
[SPEAKER_00]: out of curiosity purposes, but I've just
been taking the gamble and like Hoping for
[SPEAKER_00]: the best, you know, which I think a lot of
people is what they do Do you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites when it comes to synthetic
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah blue planet nutrients blue max
two-part cow mag I love running just that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running that right now that plus the
stash blend So this is just the additive
[SPEAKER_00]: the only additive I'm really running now
when I'm using synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much my favorite
really is blue planet nutrients I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: used a three-part in all our additives to
with good success So is scrogging outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy idea and would you recommend blue
matter something else for watering indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrogging outdoor is not a crazy idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen so many pictures of amazing
Scrog results outdoors So no, it's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think A common thing that people do
instead of Scrog is they will just utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: a trial trial step for support Keeping
things up not so much Trying to create an
[SPEAKER_00]: even canopy like you do indoors with
scrogging and also I think a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll use the net but also do like just
up I think it's a 45 degree angle bend on
[SPEAKER_00]: that initial stem and that's it as far as
training Of course lollipop and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that those are a couple of
different approaches there blue mats I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend for indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so hands-off I mean I do grows
where I come back a week later Plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: fine, you know, just water only the
organic amendments in there already
[SPEAKER_00]: amended in there and go on vacation Come
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have had blue mats fail on
them I did have a fail on it turn remember
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what that happened like one plant
failed it didn't like flood my house like
[SPEAKER_00]: some people have reported it happened to
them just because it could be user error
[SPEAKER_00]: right if you're not adjusting the dial on
there it could certainly fail right if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not Doing it if you're not setting
it up properly, but if they follow
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions set it up properly two
notches back Just like they say in the
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one what that happened like one
dried out I don't know where I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: if there was like maybe a kink in the line
or something, you know not the main line
[SPEAKER_00]: but the Carrot line that branches off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's a kink in there something
but one plant kind of dried out So I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to like reset that whole carrot so I have
had them fail before but as long as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: monitoring things and checking on it daily
You know every couple days you can correct
[SPEAKER_00]: issues like that since you had the Evo 3
what's your opinion now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So AC infinity Evo 3 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it bar style lights for a two foot
by four foot grow space I'm still running
[SPEAKER_00]: it to this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running it ever since it came
out earlier this year and I love the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can connect it to the app So I
have control over it on the AC infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: app so I can you know control the light
schedule control the dimming amount that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's set at so on and so forth and Yeah,
seeing some good results great growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a par meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm able to kind of dial in the light
distance I'm able to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: again just adjust the dimmer down if
needed and bring it closer or Crease the
[SPEAKER_00]: light distance and ramp it up whatever
power I want to get so there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: flexibility there with with the dimmer and
such But I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No complaints.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had to recalibrate one of
your blue mad carrots mid cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so mind sharing how you went about
getting it going correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so this is Pretty much just what I
answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check on them almost every day just to
for that ease of mind I'm going in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and just looking to make sure that things
still functioning correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly There's times where the initial
install the next day I'll go in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see like it's dripping pretty fast
and I'm just like hmm Might need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like it should be dripping
down that fast Well, some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants seems to be dripping at a normal
rate so then I'll go in there and make the
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments right and Once you use the
blue mats along Enough, you can kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: feel exactly where you need to stop It's
around that two notch back as they say on
[SPEAKER_00]: the instruction Some people do not a notch
and a half back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, absolutely I've always I think
pretty frequently I go in there and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of tinkering around with it specifically
the day after install I'm going in there
[SPEAKER_00]: and checking and some of them I might have
to recalibrate slightly How'd you reset
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue my carrot after went dry pinch
the tubes take it out and completely
[SPEAKER_00]: refill and reset?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so you can you can pinch it and then
that way you can take it out refill and
[SPEAKER_00]: reset What I did actually is I had another
carrot that I already had soaking So I was
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do the swap pretty quickly there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes pinch it So I'll take the old one
out put the new one in and then connect So
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have an extra carrot
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the 12 pack So I do have some extras
kind of lying around most of the time at
[SPEAKER_00]: least unless I have 12 plants growing My
stash plant came into any any suggestions
[SPEAKER_00]: on how I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing in Soil soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally recommend a half teaspoon to
one teaspoon per gallon of water basically
[SPEAKER_00]: mix it into water and then water your
plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Most efficient way to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people are sprinkling on their
roots during transplant That's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: recommended by the scientist who helped
develop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are using it in DWC at a I
believe it's a fourth dosage and They're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing some good results there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just plain and simple mix it up
in water Make sure it's mixed in real well
[SPEAKER_00]: and then water your plants with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two electric skies They're out of
business now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to keep them turned down on my
plants don't like them I always had really
[SPEAKER_00]: good success running the electric guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the v1s the v2s and the v3s I
thought it was a great company excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service Quality product many
people are still running the electric guys
[SPEAKER_00]: right now with great results I think the
original v1 was what released in 2017 if I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember correctly and here we are what
six years later and They're still working
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you got yourself a good light there
How does someone start a living soil bed
[SPEAKER_00]: without going to build a soil kiss
organics go there instead?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that way there are more companies,
of course than build a soil direct
[SPEAKER_00]: competitor is kiss organics Kis organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out that hussy You can also go to
search Clackamas Coot soil mix now might
[SPEAKER_00]: be on the build a soil website is the
recipe but you can buy the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: Ingredients elsewhere some people could
start on Amazon, you know, they could buy
[SPEAKER_00]: the three parts, you know Whether it be
like cocoa a form of variation and some
[SPEAKER_00]: compost or worm castings to start Plus a
fertilizer blend people definitely start
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil bed without going to build a
soil There are other options out there for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, but I personally do love build a
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not only have great products,
but Jeremy over there doing his thing on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram YouTube is mostly what iTunes
Into a lot of great information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you started teaching a little one
about organics yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some light reading of your new book
before bedtime Yeah, so for those that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know I have a daughter now,
so newborn she was actually born over a
[SPEAKER_00]: month ago now October 5th is when her
birthday is and so I'm still in the Barely
[SPEAKER_00]: getting any sleep stage apparently that
lasts for what the first year or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that Don't give don't get much sleep
because you got a little one there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but no I haven't started teaching her
about organics Yeah, she could barely hold
[SPEAKER_00]: up her head So but I should start to read
her some information about that on a
[SPEAKER_00]: nightly basis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe by you know, two three four
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll start gardening with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: You
