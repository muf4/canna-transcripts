[SPEAKER_03]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka MrGrowit and I'm back with
[SPEAKER_03]: another video.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got something a little bit different
for you today.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode we're going to talk to THC
Titan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I say we because it's not just me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chris from Happy Hydro is also joining me
on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And full disclosure, this is an old
episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was actually filmed a couple years
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on a different YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: That YouTube channel got deleted and
there's some really good information in
[SPEAKER_03]: this so I figured a re-release would be
worthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is actually an episode from a
podcast the podcast was called Happy Hour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the host is Chris from Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was the co-host.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't speak very much in the episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more of like an interview with THC
Titan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The topics that we cover is grow room
setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also talk a little bit about breeding
and then we finish off the episode talking
[SPEAKER_03]: about environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I mentioned this was filmed a
couple years back so I'm sure THC Titan's
[SPEAKER_03]: grow room setup is different now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Head on over to his channel you can see
his most updated date setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is actually the first episode of the
podcast so it's a little bit all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: place as far as flow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also for the first five minutes when THC
Titan is talking it's kind of like cutting
[SPEAKER_03]: in and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hang in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just for five minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's super annoying, yes, but if you can
get through that first five minutes it's
[SPEAKER_03]: clear from there on out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have three more of these
podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_03]: This one that you're about to watch is
really just audio only.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other three that I have I believe two
out of three I have video as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I do end up releasing those I will
include the video as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright I've rambled on enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey everybody I'm Chris and I'm here with
Mr. Growit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up man?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is going on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got THC Titan here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys having me on and
getting a chance to chat with you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah no problem man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd like to talk to you about your grow
methods and some of the equipment you use
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess where we would like to begin
is pretend you're walking into your grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you kind of like tell me what you see
and like how your setup goes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right when you walk in let's see you
have it's basically a 15 by 12 and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: two just wings nearest me, air
conditioner, about 15,000 BTU,
[SPEAKER_00]: three air-cooled double-ended hoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running all double-ended in the
room and basically I run like a Scrog
[SPEAKER_00]: screen in green style.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trellis is only there for support but
it looks you know like a traditional Scrog
[SPEAKER_00]: but you'll see some top shoot up here and
there but yeah so and then I have a
[SPEAKER_00]: walkway in the middle but the flower is
just gonna be a sea of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you're really gonna see and
yeah pretty nice 5,000 watts right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're assumed to somewhere around 6,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn dude that sounds pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at your video and I saw that you
have a carbon filter and a fan mounted in
[SPEAKER_02]: the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that constantly exhausting like while
your air conditioner is running?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like does it exhaust some of your cold
air?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I have it set to a Zephyr 3
controller by Titan Controls I believe and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a temperature set point so and it
will dial up and dial down based on what
[SPEAKER_00]: you set it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you set it at like 95 and that's 100%
and then you set your low end like 63 and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that's 0% so as it gets closer and
closer to that warmer range you'll slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: ramp up so I would say when I'm running my
81 degrees that you should run I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: it's running at about 40% maximum so just
barely like can't be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works extremely well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and that controller is pretty legit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that an expensive controller?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it sounds like pretty legit setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: $90 pretty cheap actually you know
considering for what it does it's
[SPEAKER_00]: basically just a sensor on the little can
go up so it's not sitting you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: against the wall or down on the floor so
you can kind of put it out in your hottest
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like the it doesn't monitor
your CO2 or do you use CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I run CO2 at just above ambient at
like 700 parts per million so nothing
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually in the 700 to 900 range so just
enough to keep it up above and to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm not expending a lot you know on
gas because it can get expensive if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just exhausting it out of the room in that
manner but this way it's slowly pulling it
[SPEAKER_00]: across can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go through them every two weeks which is
not that bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh you set a tank every two weeks?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah that's not too bad and have you
ever like done a side by side or an
[SPEAKER_02]: experiment where you've ran 700 ppms and
then like 1200 or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I've been running CO2 for about a
year now so I've been slowly working my
[SPEAKER_00]: way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started around 500 up to 900 so I'm only
increasing it 100 at a time so I can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of see the results and what right now the
900 seems like a sweet spot because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a burner so turn on when the ambient CO2
gets below the set point and when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: turning on too often for me my temperature
gets a little bit too high so this would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a sweet spot for me and my next row
will be fully sealed so the burner won't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to turn on as often.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your air conditioner now is that like a
mini split?
[SPEAKER_00]: The air conditioner is just a portable
dual hose just from Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hose gets exhausted the hot air gets
exhausted to the attic and in the attic I
[SPEAKER_00]: have the filter and then it pulls all the
hot air from the attic and then exhaust it
[SPEAKER_00]: outside so there's not that build up.
[SPEAKER_02]: A carbon filter in the attic did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: 8 inch fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: For fans are you buying like the most
expensive can fan or are you just using
[SPEAKER_02]: like regular 8 inch fans from Amazon or
eBay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well typically I like the max fans I've
had nothing but reliability from then and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in their can fans but the
cheapest fan I can get only because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be running at a very high
temperature and it's probably gonna die
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner than later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give it a life expectancy of about six
months to be honest because all that hot
[SPEAKER_00]: air running through that fan is gonna
break down any electronical component or
[SPEAKER_00]: motor components over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you said it was a max fan that you're
using or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a value line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you knew that you were gonna be
beating on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I knew eventually it's gonna you know
the motor is gonna overheat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Max fans have been extremely reliable for
me that my 10 inch one that I have I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had for about five years now running
almost constantly so it's really really
[SPEAKER_00]: really reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do they have different size models
like do they have six inch eight inch so
[SPEAKER_03]: on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah six to twelve for their for the style
that I have I forgot what they call it but
[SPEAKER_00]: like their max fan I think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a buddy who has a max fan who he's
had it for like five or six years too and
[SPEAKER_02]: still running like a champ.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of medium are you growing in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you growing in pots or cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I grow to my flower room typically
number 10 containers with pure cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried a few different brands some of
them I don't like I've had bad experience
[SPEAKER_00]: with like I don't know I don't want to say
anything bad about companies but basically
[SPEAKER_00]: the best cocoa I've ever tried is either
canna cocoa or cloud core charcoal cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always great results from both of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you hand water or do you set up a
drip or something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hand watering currently but this next
round I should have the floor flex
[SPEAKER_00]: installed and I'll have it set up on
automatic watering which will be nice to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of document and show everybody how to
do it if they're interested.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's sweet you'll be showing that
on your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC Titan is the channel everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have never seen the floor flex you said?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the floor flex it's like an octa
bubbler system if you're familiar with
[SPEAKER_00]: those so basically they built it usually
you have to build them on your own it only
[SPEAKER_00]: comes with the head but the floor flex
comes fully built out and all you do is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically glue it into your PVC and plug
in your hoses and you're good to go and
[SPEAKER_00]: even has an adjustable valve on it so you
can adjust each eight site you know
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure based on what you like which will
work out great for me because I have on
[SPEAKER_00]: one side I have smaller plants and the
other side a bigger plant so I'm gonna set
[SPEAKER_00]: up the floor flex you know accordingly and
adjust the pressure from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that so that's that's not a hydro
system it's just a watering system for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Drip system yeah correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Drip system gotcha yeah I'll have to check
that out after the show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you so is your are you on like a
concrete floor or anything do you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep your plants off the ground?
[SPEAKER_00]: So where I'm growing is basically a home
that I've basically blown out you know
[SPEAKER_00]: into a a girl house you know like you know
and then so I have my main flower room
[SPEAKER_00]: which is carpeted and then two layers of
panda film on top and so I don't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: worry about any kind of like root damage
from temperature and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah because I've I know a lot of people
have dealt with that like growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: basements and just putting the plants on
the floor and not really knowing what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing and then having the cold
temperatures from the floor screw up the
[SPEAKER_02]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah especially if you have like cloth
pots it's like just magnified even more
[SPEAKER_00]: intensely because there's not that plastic
barrier in between I had an issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: that in my I had a girl with a partner and
it's probably on my YouTube channel like
[SPEAKER_00]: one of my first two or three videos
uploaded and it has the concrete floors
[SPEAKER_00]: and we were getting slower growth and we
didn't have any kind of barrier in between
[SPEAKER_00]: the concrete and then later like four
months later I finally realized oh my gosh
[SPEAKER_00]: you know when it's winter why does
everything slow down well that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: because cold concrete.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that you were able to pinpoint
that problem I mean a lot of people just
[SPEAKER_02]: might never figure that out like did you
switch to plastic pots after that or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah actually we did yeah we switched to
number 10s bigger pots and I was like oh
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just the bigger pots and yeah it
turns out that you know because we
[SPEAKER_00]: adjusted everything we turned down our you
know got our environment dialed in you
[SPEAKER_00]: know dehumidifiers and everything and
whatnot and the growth still wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: picking up like it should have but then we
switched we ran a few tester plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: number 10s and the growth was way better
like wow it must be the medium because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little bit more medium like two more
gallons worth the medium but yeah then
[SPEAKER_00]: later I connected connected the two so
almost stumbled upon it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are the number 10s are those 10 gallon
pots or?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just below 10 gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you using for nutrient lineup and
additives?
[SPEAKER_00]: So nutrients I kind of run whatever
basically to be honest with you nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: really aren't that important in my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last round I ran nectar for the gods ran
their whole line and got pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: results I was happy with it but the amount
of work and just the overall cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: of it I'm not really a fan of even though
it isn't all or 90 some 8% organic but
[SPEAKER_00]: from the earth basically line I like that
you know that's that's nice but I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors so I'm not really worried about
runoff and adding salts I guess you would
[SPEAKER_00]: say chemicals as most people say to the to
the ecosystem so I'm gonna go back to just
[SPEAKER_00]: a micro and bloom base and probably a few
organic additives added in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said it's not in nutrients aren't
really important to you what's your
[SPEAKER_03]: thought process on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I've ran through so many nutrient
lines I mean from Kana to GH dry powder to
[SPEAKER_00]: GH liquid nectar for the gods bio biz
house and garden I've ran so many and
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced I used their big button overdrive
in the past I have not used any of their
[SPEAKER_00]: bases because usually all the bases are
pretty similar when they're in a liquid
[SPEAKER_00]: form unless they're organics and they
start to get proprietary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically all these nutrient lines out
there you're saying are basically very
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to the fact where yeah yeah
based off of my experience and what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the nutrients don't have that much
impact I'd say the environment and just
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers eyes way more important along
with genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor I ran the nectar this round and I
mean the flavor I mean the only thing I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed is that it cures a little bit
faster it's easier to get to that point of
[SPEAKER_00]: smooth smoke if that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many plants are you growing in your
operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 15 in flower and then the rest are
up and down you know based on need.
[SPEAKER_02]: You must be growing some monster plants to
cover 5,000 lots with 15 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah they're pretty big usually the
typical yield if it's not a cookie strain
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a half pound per plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn how many plants per light then?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two to three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two to three got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along those lines some are bigger some are
smaller.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything you'd like to change that you
haven't tried yet in your setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to try out LED lighting so I
did grab another light from Pacific Light
[SPEAKER_00]: Concepts to try out their LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how that works because she
grows thanks she you'll see a few of her
[SPEAKER_00]: videos on my channel she has like a 4x4
tent and she has all of the Cree cobs to
[SPEAKER_00]: chip on board lights in her tent and I've
been blown away by the results for low
[SPEAKER_00]: wattage 600 watts is putting out like you
know a thousand watts could and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: noticed that she can run a little bit
higher temperature and still get really
[SPEAKER_00]: really good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh the citizen I have the citizen cobs
also running in a little 2x4 closet it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like my little test area for new
incoming strains new genetics that I test
[SPEAKER_00]: out and confirm myself and that thing has
been performing just as well as the the
[SPEAKER_00]: Cree cobs and it's about half the price I
think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're saying you do you test out all
strains in a little small area before you
[SPEAKER_02]: go to a big room?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them yeah I with the the genetics
you don't you know all new genetics you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't really know what you're gonna get
you know so for me it's important to
[SPEAKER_00]: verify the quality on my own see it
firsthand and and I have a 2x4 closet
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just set up with a little 200 watt
citizen cob light and I have the she grows
[SPEAKER_00]: tank tent which is a 4x4 and we do testing
in there before they make it to full more
[SPEAKER_00]: more full production in the bigger flower
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I mean it seems like the smart thing
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I know you also do some breeding as
well right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah right yeah square one genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get into all that actually just
kind of a basic question how did you first
[SPEAKER_03]: get into growing and then maybe after you
know you kind of answer that then we can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of get into the the whole breeding
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I first got in a very young age I had
cousins who were a lot older than me like
[SPEAKER_00]: about four years and so they had more
readily available access I guess to it and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I just hang out hung out with them and
you know smoked my first time and I liked
[SPEAKER_00]: it and then I took I don't know I stopped
smoking for I don't know some around eight
[SPEAKER_00]: years and then I started smoking again and
I was just wasn't happy with the product
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very inconsistent I never knew what
I was gonna get it was like playing the
[SPEAKER_00]: lottery every single time and that gets
real old real real fast and so I said I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna grow on my own you know I'm gonna do
it on my own so I started with a little
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 watt ceramic metal halide and an attic
and some pineapple express that was my
[SPEAKER_00]: first successful grow completed all the
way through grow with pineapple express
[SPEAKER_00]: because who doesn't love that movie that's
one of my all-time favorites to be honest
[SPEAKER_00]: and then yeah flowered that out and just
kept expanding slowly from there you know
[SPEAKER_00]: one night at a time reinvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many years have you been growing
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Over seven now consistently back-to-back
no no gaps just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a job too or is it just
strictly growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used I used to work 12 hour days I used
to have worked like six days a week 12
[SPEAKER_00]: hour days but and then I knew eventually
that if I just kept going and kept pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: that eventually I wouldn't have to work
anymore and eventually I got to the point
[SPEAKER_00]: where I saved enough money where I could
say I quit and so I left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just I grow on my own that's all I
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're living the American dream bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you're focused a lot on breeding
and creating your own genetics and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: like that is that correct you can kind of
tell us a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so the breeding I had a few crosses
that I did in the past just for my own
[SPEAKER_00]: personal like some cam dog double diesel
cross with like a blueberry strain but
[SPEAKER_00]: that was about two years three years into
my growing career and then I wasn't taking
[SPEAKER_00]: it seriously at all and then now I the
same kind of thing I was getting genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and clones that I wasn't really happy with
you know it was a crapshoot when I would
[SPEAKER_00]: try to get a clone that's labeled cookies
and it looks like blue dream you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not unacceptable in my eyes and so really
with me it's about having verifiable solid
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and now you know if this is like
the perfect opportunity for somebody who
[SPEAKER_00]: is interested in seeds to get them because
they can literally see it grown right in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of them and then you know you know
exactly what you're getting which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wanted to have a good handle of
what I'm dealing with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is super legit and especially
like being I'm on the East Coast I'm in
[SPEAKER_02]: New York dude I've seen people will call
anything a cookie strain that they have
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just everything's cookie is like so
what you're doing is pretty sweet that's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely adding value to the growing
community by providing like good genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're basically going to show
everybody what you're growing on your
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel and then yeah you can see
any any strain that has I have ever
[SPEAKER_00]: released you can see on my channel or many
pictures of it through the Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: account as well so it's all verified and
it's all there for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like throw down like your grams per
watt and stuff like that for people like
[SPEAKER_02]: the side like I don't know you see that
type of stuff and you're looking for seeds
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes?
[SPEAKER_00]: No because the phenotype variation is hard
it's hard to tell you know you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: big yielding cookie pheno but you might
have to hunt through 30 seeds to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: pheno or you might get lucky and get it in
only a five pack you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are f1 generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just next level shit it's over my
head almost man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we at Mr. Growett?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to find out what the biggest
yield is today and you know how much juice
[SPEAKER_03]: were you running at the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest yield today let's see I think my
biggest yield was like nine point eight
[SPEAKER_00]: seven pounds from the five the five legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow which is which is it's it's okay you
know some some people these days are
[SPEAKER_00]: claiming over three so I mean whatever
magic juice they're feeding to their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants I want some I know it's not Mammoth
B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh shit we love you Mammoth B don't take
it too bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: So five thousand let me get this right the
five thousand watts basically you're
[SPEAKER_03]: saying you had lighting and you got over
nine pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah nine point eight seven nine point
nine fully manicured trim tried ready to
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's legit man that's that's wild.
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your what was your biggest
catastrophe in growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest catastrophe oh man powdery powdery
mildew and late flower and with my partner
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a grow like a big bigger garage
grow like I said it's on my YouTube but
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah we had a bigger grow and then late in
flower powdery mildew was showing up and
[SPEAKER_00]: little you know it looked like powdered
sugar at first I didn't know what it was
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was still new newish to growing
and identified it and all we could do was
[SPEAKER_00]: do a hard leaf strip it was about day 56
of flower so we were really close to being
[SPEAKER_00]: done so we did a hard leaf strip and wiped
with hydrogen peroxide on leaves that we
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't strip so it's kind of like a
salvage situation it's like oh crap we got
[SPEAKER_00]: to save this crop as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you did you save it like did you make
out with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah yeah the product ended up being
completely fine nothing got to the bud but
[SPEAKER_00]: on the on on there's a lot on the leafs
like the bigger major fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like that's kind of what like
the fact that you were able to proactively
[SPEAKER_02]: know what like you figured out what to do
very quickly which is good and I know I've
[SPEAKER_02]: met a lot of growers who didn't do not
figure stuff out that quickly and then a
[SPEAKER_02]: small you know powdery mildew turns into
an entire like your biggest catastrophe
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't really sound that bad you took
care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well in a way it was just because all of
the work that it took you know can you
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine wiping like every little you know
every little single serrated leaf that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out of the bud like just to make
sure this is what it felt like you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it's just all about doing your
research before I even started growing I
[SPEAKER_00]: would read and read and read and read some
of the information has not translated over
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is the internet but most of it
has and I'm very very very thankful that
[SPEAKER_00]: the internet is even here today to be able
to absorb the knowledge that I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bud washing man we learned about that the
other day right Mr. Groen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bud washing yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried it what do you guys think
about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we deem?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see a lot of people doing it nowadays
right there was some concern about people
[SPEAKER_03]: you know washing off of trichomes but then
there's the argument well and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: outside it rains all the time those wash
off the trichomes no so yeah there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of a lot of debate about bud washing so
I've never tried it so I can't really
[SPEAKER_03]: speak too much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I would think that it's fine to be
honest I think a lot of people might get
[SPEAKER_00]: upset by hearing that but the trichomes
are not water-soluble themselves so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think a quick dip in the pool really
wouldn't do much to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys heard it wash your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying wash your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying do that I'm just saying I
get it you know I understand the logic
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right no I do too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does make sense if done right I mean
you know somebody out there is gonna wash
[SPEAKER_02]: their bud and then put it in a room that's
70% humidity and ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely you're gonna get mold and bud
rot and they're gonna be very unhappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right but they'll learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you could this is one of my favorite
questions in the podcast here if you could
[SPEAKER_03]: go back in time with the knowledge you
have now right you go back in time and
[SPEAKER_03]: talk to yourself before you started your
first grow what advice would you give to
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow start breeding now I mean you know
that's the best way that I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: everything when it comes to growing is you
just shut up and do it just start doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: get your hands in the dirt so to speak and
just do it and I wish I would have started
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding sooner so I could get more of the
hands-on experience and knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I wish I would have started taking
breeding seriously sooner because I love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very fun to one create your own
strain and to see it come to fruition
[SPEAKER_00]: right in front of you you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've never like accidentally erect a
crop by like getting male pollen into your
[SPEAKER_02]: flower room?
[SPEAKER_00]: No I have only have one little breeding
chamber four by four and it's constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: being exhausted I would say maybe if the
fan went out and the tent was open it
[SPEAKER_00]: might but I don't think there's enough
negative air pressure and the other rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: to suck it you know into those rooms but
luckily I haven't had that catastrophe yet
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that would be a good story if it
did happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hope it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get all that pollen exhausting up
into your attic so just don't grow plants
[SPEAKER_03]: in your attic and you should be good to
go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone over pretty much everything we
went we went over you're using we know
[SPEAKER_02]: your nutrients right Nectar for the Gods?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and I'll be running just cutting edge
solutions micro and bloom really I think
[SPEAKER_00]: if you stick to micro and bloom and then
kind of work in organic additives you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have phenomenal results as long as your
environment your genetics are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What temperature do you try to keep your
plants at in bloom and what do you try to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep them at in veg and do you control
your humidity with a dehumidifier or
[SPEAKER_02]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah so the temperature I like to run in
flower is 78 to 81 degrees because mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have co2 so I run it a little
bit warmer than traditionally and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg I'm not too worried as long as it
doesn't get above like 88 degrees and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I will start to freak out because yeah
it's a little too warm but I try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it below 88 and anywhere in there and then
humidity is controlled by a dehumidifier
[SPEAKER_00]: but I really don't start running the
dehumidifier until about week three of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower because I'm trying to push that VPD
the vapor pressure deficit in those first
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks especially because that's when
there isn't any kind of bud on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: at all and so I try to do that you know
run that like 70 I usually keep my
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity 10% lower than my temperature and
that seems to be a pretty good range for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That seems like a great rule that everyone
can write down keep your humidity 10%
[SPEAKER_02]: lower than your temperature and VPD can
you go a little bit into that for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD my understanding of it is it's the
vapor pressure deficit of the leaf in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room I could be wrong but and then you're
trying to keep the somata open in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: absorb more co2 and increase and drive
photosynthesis so I've seen good results
[SPEAKER_00]: ever since I started running with it and
going along with it and plus my electric
[SPEAKER_00]: bill has gone down because I've been able
to keep the dehumidifier in like 70%
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity but one thing I have noticed is I
need to keep my nighttime temperature in
[SPEAKER_00]: check.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it between 65 and 70 when I
am running VPD and then the last two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: I just try to suck out as much moisture as
I can to hopefully induce trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: development because of the the dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like when you say you're running VPD
you mean like you're just running a
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity that's 10% lower than your than
your temperature throughout up until week
[SPEAKER_02]: three of bloom?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll run that all the way until the last I
would say two weeks I run that the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: time as long as my temperature isn't
dropping at night where that's where that
[SPEAKER_00]: controller comes in clutch and really
really handy is it it'll turn off your
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fan once it reaches that lower
threshold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if your temperature gets too low
then you're worried about pottery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: or even like rust fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our bud rot is concerned because the
colors are usually dense and tight tightly
[SPEAKER_00]: formed and the dominant strains are really
susceptible to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like this kind of goes against
what's traditionally like done in bloom
[SPEAKER_02]: like most people say to lower your
humidity in bloom correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah usually people run like 76 degrees
and like 50% humidity but if you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the VPD chart that falls almost right in
line to being in in the the green zone as
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak of where you should be but
yeah I push mine a little bit my humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit higher than traditionally
followed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if your temperature is at 80 degrees
what is your humidity at?
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% yeah I'll set my dehumidifier for 70
and then it will usually keep it right
[SPEAKER_00]: around that 65 to 70% range.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people have the knowledge that if
you're running over 60% humidity there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: chance of getting powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're running it at 70% how are you
preventing powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well one way would be to keep your
nighttime temperatures warmer so you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not creating that environment for the
powdery mildew to grow because usually hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and cold don't mix for the grower you know
and you'll see people will run their lines
[SPEAKER_00]: outside or they'll be sucking in cool air
from outside and they'll have water
[SPEAKER_00]: dripping from their their ducting because
it's the hot and the cold air meeting and
[SPEAKER_00]: in that area that's where you get
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one tip that I found that works
extremely well for keeping powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: at bay is foliar spraying with silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not really doing anything to
the plant because it's not really a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available I believe with a potassium
silicate but I use a potassium silicate
[SPEAKER_00]: and I spray on my plants anytime I do a
foliar all through veg all the way until I
[SPEAKER_00]: hit flower and then I stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that's doing is it's changing the
pH of the leaf and creating that barrier
[SPEAKER_00]: on the leaf itself and ever since I
started doing that I have never seen one
[SPEAKER_00]: little speck of powdery mildew at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome I never heard that before.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I mean that's a pretty good tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said you're referring to nighttime
so you're doing 18-6 for veg?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah 18-6.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I run 20 and 4, 20 on 4 off in my
little veg area which is just a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: watts and then a hundred watt spectrum
king light and then in my main flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room to cut costs because 5,000 watts I
run 18-6 and then as I'm getting closer to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower like a week before I'm gonna flower
I lower the nights or the daytime by an
[SPEAKER_00]: hour like every other day or every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh so you ease them in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I transition into the uh just like
outside they transition into the flip you
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah yeah I know it's cool I've never done
it before but I've heard of people doing
[SPEAKER_02]: it and I guess unless somebody does it
side by side we'll never really know if it
[SPEAKER_02]: truly makes a difference but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I figure I'm saving on an hour of
electricity you know every single day and
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any negative negative results
from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's true it seems like you have
your shit dialed in pretty good man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks yeah hopefully by now I would
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's upcoming for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you working on any projects you know
within the industry or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Upcoming really just trying to work on the
genetics is a very high priority for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've invested a lot of my time into the
genetics the square one genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: really just be able to provide that
transparency and the results that people
[SPEAKER_00]: can see and just in my flowering just
transitioning over to the LED that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really my only two bigger things right now
I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you uh you're on YouTube you have
your website?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah YouTube THC Titan and then Instagram
same THC Titan and square one genetics and
[SPEAKER_00]: then www.squareonegenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah you have some really good Instagram
pictures I'm pretty new to Instagram I
[SPEAKER_03]: followed you you know a few weeks ago I
think yeah really quality photos so you
[SPEAKER_03]: guys are on Instagram definitely follow
him if you guys are on YouTube I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: you've got how many videos you have on
your YouTube channel you have over 100
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 something I'm not even keeping I think
it was like 120 last time I looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ton of videos ton of videos so you've been
around for quite a while on YouTube very
[SPEAKER_03]: well experienced a lot of good knowledge
from you so definitely follow this guy and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know pick up his genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool guys I think this is a good time to
wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah good thing to wrap it up any final
words for anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just thanks thanks for having me on I
appreciate it you know it's nice to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to like-minded people and you know really
just get my word out there I guess you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and hopefully create a what like a
tidal wave of the same momentum with other
[SPEAKER_00]: people making ensuring the quality
integrity and transparency with genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: and just growing in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure man I just want to say one thing
everybody go go buy your genetics from
[SPEAKER_02]: this guy because you really don't want to
run into having shitty genetics because
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have everything else perfect and
then you have shitty genetics you're
[SPEAKER_02]: screwed so get them from this guy shows
you he shows you them and he obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: here to try to help everybody as you can
tell so that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright well thanks for coming on man
appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: you
