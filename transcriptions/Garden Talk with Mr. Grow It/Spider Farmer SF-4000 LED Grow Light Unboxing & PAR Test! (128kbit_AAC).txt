[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching Max's channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the Spider Farmer SF4000 LED
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer sent me this grow light to
test out and I figured I would do this
[SPEAKER_00]: unboxing and also test the power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the grow
lights features in this video but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a link to this grow light in the
description section below so you can click
[SPEAKER_00]: on that link to learn more about this grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also provided me a coupon for my
viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use code MRGrowIt5 on Amazon USA,
Amazon CA, DE or Amazon UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any light being emitted outside
of that range it's not going to show on
[SPEAKER_00]: this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay first thing out the box they've
included some garden tags.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few different colors here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a wire hanging kit and two rope
ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power cord is already attached to the
drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use two drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The meanwhile ELG240.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've included some measuring tape so
you can measure out the light distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thank you card and the SF series grow
lights user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light has a flowering
coverage area of five foot by five foot
[SPEAKER_00]: although many growers say that this is
overstated a little bit and it's said that
[SPEAKER_00]: a full foot by full foot grow space is a
better fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to hang the grow light in a full
foot by full foot grow tent and I'll take
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements at four different distances
which are the distances that they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend in their user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 inches away, 24 inches away,
18 inches away, and 12 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time watching one of
my power test videos I do this just to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a general idea of what the power
output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody has a PAR meter so they
can't check and see these numbers
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves so this isn't going to be 100%
accurate test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the reflective walls on the grow tent
could increase the numbers so just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing to look at before we get into
the measurements is the wattage pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: My kilowatt meter shows 3.68 amps pulling
443 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about these
measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below along with the discount code.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
