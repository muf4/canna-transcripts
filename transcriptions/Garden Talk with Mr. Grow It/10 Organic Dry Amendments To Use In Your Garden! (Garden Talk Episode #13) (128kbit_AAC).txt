[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your plants kind of weak and you're
trying to train some of your plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: get better growth you got to train it and
it snaps instead of just kind of bending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's because a lot of it might be
not enough silica that your plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting or using or in available form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The chelation is a multivalent ion with
the cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another one of those cation exchanges
that it can chelate and change some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these multivalent bonds ion bonds and help
with different plants to chelate different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or to lock things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes are what help with how plants
express themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they use nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know as a newbie keeping it simple I
can grab a couple boxes of a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients that have some beneficial
biology and some good nutrients and start
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 13.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Medically Fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a YouTuber that has over 18,000
subscribers and he's been creating
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening content since 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 10 years now and
he grows vegetables medicinal and host
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode we talk about 10 different
dry amendments that you can use in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different amendments out
there that can be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just cover a short list today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about what the amendments are,
what the benefits are, and application
[SPEAKER_00]: rates.

[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright Medically Fit welcome to Garden
Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited to have you on dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been following your channel
since like 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you were like one of the first people
that I've actually started watching so I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like fanboying it out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting to me because I didn't
really know that you were kind of a fan of
[SPEAKER_01]: mine and so it's really nice to know that
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were one of the people who actually
like I think you were one of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: people to actually nudge me over to the
organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember you came onto my live stream
one time and I was like checking the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: the runoff and you're like why do you
check the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: With the organics you don't have to and
you're like come over to my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were definitely an inspiration for me
to kind of transitioning over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean the amount of knowledge that you
have on the organics side of thing is
[SPEAKER_00]: something I admire so I'm super excited to
have you on the show today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know who you are
can you just tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I've been a cultivator since 2011,
12ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started kind of learning when I lived in
Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back then I wanted to know about
cultivating vegetables and medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plants for me and Nevada was a medical
state so I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really wanted to kind of know and
that's what got me into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of pushed me even harder is I
lost my father and like being around
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and just growing really helped
because I didn't have like the cognitive
[SPEAKER_01]: skills and understand how to deal with
that type of loss in my life and it really
[SPEAKER_01]: helped me deal with how to get through the
loss because I was able to get in and kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of take care of things and like just sit
there and be with the plants and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so medicinal plants, do you own any
fruits, veggies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors, outdoors or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like summertime we try to get our
garden going so we'll do a vegetable crop
[SPEAKER_01]: squash, tomatoes, peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do some other like mints and
herbs for in the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor we do some medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just recently moved to Pueblo area.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of harder to do it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heat, it's really dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sometimes almost just as bad as
living in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do a lot more indoor if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to control some of my
environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can grow year round instead of just
through the summer and spring seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down here in Pueblo we have a little bit
later fall so I can get a little bit later
[SPEAKER_01]: crop outdoors if I need to for some of my
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of a little bit of both really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the topic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to talk all about dry
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many different dry
amendments that can be incorporated in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dozens of different amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to be able to talk about
all of them today, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about a handful of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have a whole wealth of knowledge
in regards to a lot of these amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's really what I want to pick your
brain on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched your video that you have on
drying nutrient tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your nutrient tea video and this kind
of inspired the questions that I have for
[SPEAKER_00]: you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically have a list of amendments that
we're going to go over for him and I have
[SPEAKER_00]: a feeling that a lot of my viewers aren't
even going to like be aware of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess this would probably maybe be
like a more intermediate slash advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: type topic, you know, because a lot of
these things that we talk about there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not used in a lot of normal used
application garden settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of the amendments that I use,
most people don't use in their garden
[SPEAKER_01]: settings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it for a specific reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of my reason is everything that
I've been learning and understanding from
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the self-taught education growing
up in Iowa around farmers trying to learn,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, understand cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I try to use a vast variety of
different dry organic amendments and most
[SPEAKER_01]: people are like, oh, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know what the plant wants or
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to give it everything possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just get right into it then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's start with gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things that you
incorporate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, gypsum is it's a calcium and a
sulfur kind of powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works great for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find that their plants or soil are like
calcium deficient or the plants have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of calcium decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is pretty high amendment,
like 22% calcium and like 17% sulfur in
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different ways you can mix
it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a T I will mix it in a super soil mix
when I'm trying to make like a soil growth
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple different
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people really just do it more as
a top feeding or a soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a super soil, like I saying,
or a T just from the solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of repeat myself a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it also helps with like root
growth, nutrient uptake, cation exchange,
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium really does a lot for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is part of what we're trying to
do is get the plant these available
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gypsum has calcium sulfur readily
available to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of what really I found very
interesting because a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_01]: concerned with some of my soil mixes being
high and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, gypsum actually helps to reduce some
of these heavy metal toxins from manganese
[SPEAKER_01]: to boron to aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of binds it up so the plant can't
uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when a lot of people are concerned
about like using trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: trace minerals, like Azomite that we're
going to talk about, that's one of them
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of has some higher heavy metals
to it, but this will help prevent those
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals from being uptaken in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with soil structure, runoff,
kind of helps retain water a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of allowing it to run off,
balances the pH, kind of like what
[SPEAKER_01]: dolomite lime can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real similar, but it's actually to me and
quite a few other people, gypsum is better
[SPEAKER_01]: than dolomite lime in some ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of really interesting
information that comes with just gypsum
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you use the down to earth gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk about application rates,
I know you said you can use it as like a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil conditioner, also as a top rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know the application rates off the
top of your head or just refer to the box?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do and I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give it to you in a two part deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the size of pot, gallon,
tube, to bale, like my measurements that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have already on like some of my super
soil, it's made out for a bale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be anywhere from a cup and a
half to six cups, just depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: much you're really trying to add to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to make it in a super
soil in a five gallon pot, it's like two
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoons, three tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really varies on each of these
depending on per gallon, per pot or the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of soil you're trying to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can give you kind of a just answer,
but I'm assuming that most of your
[SPEAKER_01]: audience are gonna make different sizes of
this when they go to use some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really look on the box, see what they
recommend down to earth has on their
[SPEAKER_01]: website kind of tells you a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also Google and some of them do
tell a little different application rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of just do a little research to
see what you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play around a little bit when I add it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I add more of it, sometimes I
add less of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of see what my plant is wanting and
what's needing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not quite dialed in, but I still
play with my recipe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Azomite, you mentioned azomite briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is azomite?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Azomite is a very interesting deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rock dust that's from ancient
volcanoes that it's harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we talk about some of the
heavier minerals being in the dirt itself
[SPEAKER_01]: because of everything that's coming up
from the volcano.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aluminum, magnesium, copper, lead,
like arsenic, heavy toxin metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not so high that I'm concerned
because most of the benefits of trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals, you as humans or we as humans
and our plants both need trace minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: for major and hormonal functions within a
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So believe it or not, the plant does need
lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does need arsenic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does need copper, zinc, boron,
aluminum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in such high doses, but they need it
for major and minor functions of how we
[SPEAKER_01]: act, how different chemicals are sent
through our body, through the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: different hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this really helps the plant basically
be in a homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we can get all the trace
macronutrients, that's kind of what rock
[SPEAKER_01]: dust, azomite is doing, is giving us that
whole variety of all these different trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals that we don't get from other
fertilizers or amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that same thing is soil,
amend the soil to begin with and also as a
[SPEAKER_00]: top dress or what would you recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add it to both my teas, one for veg,
one for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just depending on the cycle, I still add
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do add it to my soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm doing a top dress, I don't do so
much of a top dress with it because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where most of my teas I'm trying to get
some of the solubility.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I think I'm having issues, then I'm
looking more at my super soil recipe that
[SPEAKER_01]: I made instead of looking at like,
okay, what's going on with my plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it because I'm not getting trace
minerals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time I don't have deficiencies
with trace minerals just because I add
[SPEAKER_01]: more than most because I don't know how
much the plant actually needs and it needs
[SPEAKER_01]: different minerals at different times of
its cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I can get the variety and let the
biology and the soil kind of do what it
[SPEAKER_01]: does, the plant will regulate when it
wants it, when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of sit back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rock phosphate, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Rock phosphate is really interesting
because at first I used to use,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to remember it's bottled of B
vitamins.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like plant hormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So rock phosphate is kind of doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a phosphorus that's like the B
vitamin complex that the plant needs for
[SPEAKER_01]: energy, for different functions like
nutrient fix or nitrogen fixation where
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant will take different types of
nitrogen and change it to usable forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that it helps with
photosynthesis that plants really,
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps the energy, the ATP and how the
plant uses energy to create its sugars,
[SPEAKER_01]: produces its flowers, you know,
and with its growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what this rock phosphate
is, is that B complex energy that helps
[SPEAKER_01]: overall with plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you usually use it?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, it comes a couple different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes granular or powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the time I'll mix it in a tea,
try to get the solubility of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of it's soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when, if I'm trying to amend a
soil, I'll just take that and put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil to kind of help amend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing, super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm making a bale, I'll probably use
three cups for one cubic bale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I was doing like a five gallon pot,
maybe like three tablespoons, not
[SPEAKER_01]: teaspoons, tablespoons, because most of it
is in tablespoons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't see much of their nutrients or their
line or any dry amendment really using
[SPEAKER_01]: teaspoons unless you're really doing like
a hydroponic setup or something along that
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, correct me if I'm wrong, rock
phosphate and some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments someone going to take longer to
break down, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those microbes that are breaking down
those nutrients is rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the ones that take longer,
like I've heard on some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments that it takes, it can take a
year to potentially break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's like green sand for instance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll kind of talk about that later,
but green sands, one of them that
[SPEAKER_01]: literally takes 12 to 14 months before it
really gets available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, some of this takes a while to get
and become available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it may take a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it may take a few months,
depends on the biology, what the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: really asking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it varies on what's really happening in
your rib zone with the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's going to be a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of times when I'm making
teas, I'm looking for that solubility of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, where it's readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost like I'm creating a bottle
nutrient, getting that solubility ready
[SPEAKER_01]: and then feeding it to my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about solubility,
you're talking about basically turning it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a plant available form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: A liquid form where it takes some of that
nutrients and gets it to where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: soluble in a liquid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: As in insoluble means it's not able to
break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Through water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that Langbenite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Langbenite it's pretty interesting because
it's pretty much potash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much potassium, a little bit
of magnesium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those that I put in my soil
mixes when I'm mixing my super soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to my teas, I try to use
it more for flower when my plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their fruit when they're flowering,
when they're ready to just try to get more
[SPEAKER_01]: flower development.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing that I'll really kind of
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a salt, but it,
when it hits water, it will dissolve
[SPEAKER_01]: basically in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with chlorophyll within the plant
to help get chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we didn't plants need it to kind of
help with photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing that's kind of key
about using some of this potash or this
[SPEAKER_01]: Langbenite is it only not only helps with
that, but it helps with like the sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: part of it helps with enzyme activation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of helps some of the enzymes,
the proteins in the plant kind of being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to be broke down and used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of like important because
enzymes are what help with how plants
[SPEAKER_01]: express themselves, how they use nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How they kind of develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting on how some of
like the simple dry amendments really work
[SPEAKER_01]: on different cellular levels of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't really realize that just
using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a top dressing at all or just a
slow conditioner?
[SPEAKER_01]: More of a soil conditioner.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to do a top dressing because
it's while you're soluble, it would break
[SPEAKER_01]: down pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably use it in a beginning stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of flower and fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I was flipping like say my
medicinal plants and I would put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: like maybe two weeks before they really
went in the flower because then it's
[SPEAKER_01]: letting the plant kind of know,
Hey, things are happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're getting different
nutrients and it's kind of weird how
[SPEAKER_01]: people will kind of help the plan along
doing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you really put it into those
cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be something I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's probably one of them
that a lot of people have heard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use dolomite lime for soil
conditioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that have acidic soil,
dolomite lime helps really buffer and
[SPEAKER_01]: brings up the acidity level to more of a
neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're growing blueberries,
you want more acidic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really don't want some of this
dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing plants that certain
crops that more want your pH to be around
[SPEAKER_01]: six to seven and your soil or your water
is like a fourth, this dolomite lime is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help balance it out as it's kind
of breaking down over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's high in calcium, just like the
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I try to use both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two different forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of calcium and I'm letting the biology
kind of break it down and the plant take
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And however, you know, it's, it's going to
be available for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the dolomite lime also has magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a lot of people are like,
Oh, I'm having cow mag problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't quite have that using
dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much magnesium to it that I
shouldn't be having any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I am, it's because it's not in a
form that my plants able to take it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now follow up question on this one,
say hypothetical, say you have a growers
[SPEAKER_00]: using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets himself into a bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe he checks his runoff pH,
realizes it's in like the low fives needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to increase that pH wants to utilize
dolomite lime to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how long would it take to
actually adjust up that much?
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's a good question because I
haven't really tried that to see what the
[SPEAKER_01]: solubility is going to do with pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me adding it to a hydroponic,
I don't know how fast the pH is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: raise in it or how much I'm going to have
to use for the setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I have a small setup,
it may be like a tablespoon or a teaspoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I have say 10 buckets that I'm
running like a DWC or hydroponic setup,
[SPEAKER_01]: it may take a quarter cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no clear answer on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't, I would, I don't play with
that enough to really say, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you use it in this fashion,
this is what your results are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another great calcium product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't ever really seem to have
problems with calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my soil, because I have so many
different variances of getting it in
[SPEAKER_01]: oyster shell helps strengthen the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where it comes back to the calcium
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps strengthen cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with different enzymes,
the production in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shells also give the biology in your
roots or in the soil, like surface area to
[SPEAKER_01]: live off and build colonies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oyster shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not talked about a lot, but it's,
it's almost like crab shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can have some chitinase to it,
I believe, but nobody's really talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't seen it, but they're the
similar product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a silica based carbon based type
shell that to me would have almost like
[SPEAKER_01]: chitin what crab shell does, but I'm not
positive on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen a lot of information on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this can be used, soil conditioner
can be used as a top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these can really be used kind of
the same fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, there's some products that are
more soluble than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to making teas,
some of the products are going to release
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a solubility because that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're more soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're trying to make a tea with
say, oyster shell, it may have to sit a
[SPEAKER_01]: little longer to break down, to get some
of the solubility out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As where the langbenite, it may sit in
there 20 minutes and already be dissolved
[SPEAKER_01]: and ready to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does come back to once again,
some of the breakdown of the solubility of
[SPEAKER_01]: these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to make a tea,
you have to wait for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to do a top dress or amend
the soil with it, you can put it right in
[SPEAKER_01]: and let the soil cook and do it as it's
going to do and use it in a couple of 30
[SPEAKER_01]: days or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you usually brew your teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them depend on the temperature and
what I'm really trying to get in my
[SPEAKER_01]: microbe community and how large of a
community I'm trying to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm trying to water a lot of plants,
I may do more of a heavier tea where I
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute it a little bit more after it's
been brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way I can disperse it out and have a
higher count to my watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll just do a smaller dosage
where I'm like 24 hours, just get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit in the water and then apply it to my
plants and my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Green sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trace minerals like iron,
manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I want to say it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really different because a lot of the
green sand that I get is from glacier rock
[SPEAKER_01]: area where it's really been pounded and
all these trace minerals from being ground
[SPEAKER_01]: for however long these glaciers took to
move across the continent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it's really fine particles almost
like sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more minerals and not so much sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you went to the beach, all this sand
that you see, it's going to be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what green sand is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it has some trace minerals to
it, green sand is going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: higher because it's like an iron content,
potash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has cation exchange where it helps pull
up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is one of those things that helps
with cation exchange where it helps
[SPEAKER_01]: certain nutrients be taken up through an
ion exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the same thing of what
people try to do with bottled nutrients is
[SPEAKER_01]: they try to create that cation exchange
where it's being pulled up with all these
[SPEAKER_01]: ions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's similar to what green sand is going
to kind of do, but it's in a organic
[SPEAKER_01]: sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's straight silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Silica also helps with the strengthening
of cell walls just as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plant's kind of weak and you're
trying to train some of your plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: get better growth, you got to train it and
it snaps instead of just kind of bending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's because a lot of it might be
not enough silica that your plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: getting or using or in available form
because silica comes in several different
[SPEAKER_01]: forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: From using like horsetail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horsetail is another natural product for
silica, but that has to take time to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like green sand, it's one of those
that's the 12 to 14 month time to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if I'm trying to use it now,
it's not going to work because medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: users, they plant it, pot it, four months
later it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetable gardens, plant it, pot it,
produce, done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is something that you want to
use more in like a no-till setup where it
[SPEAKER_01]: has time to break down and actually be in
the soil, help really build the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, you say cation exchange and I
just filmed a podcast episode and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: released, well, it would be released last
week and I pronounced the cation exchange
[SPEAKER_00]: in an improper way and I'm going to hear
it in the comment section.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here's what's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at how it's spelled,
it's C-A-T-I-O-N.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would think that just looking at
it, but until you've heard it a few times
[SPEAKER_01]: to recognize and go, oh, that's cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like chelating, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Chelating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like chelating, spelled
chelating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's C-H.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about granular humic acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humic acids are one of those things that
it's created over a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fulvic and humic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both are kind of takes a long time to
develop and humic acid comes from like
[SPEAKER_01]: Leonardite slate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's from a slate, almost like a clay
material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen slate walking around
like beaches or like around the Great
[SPEAKER_01]: Lakes Midwest, there's a lot of slate
along the riverbed area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a rock, but it's so thin and
it's so slippery that it's weird because
[SPEAKER_01]: slate, what this product is made from,
it actually helps to chelate different
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very weird what humic acid does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually can detoxify heavy
minerals and soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to the azomite, heavy
minerals, heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those other products that
can lock it up so it can't be taken up by
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on top of gypsum kind of helping the
plant with the detox of these heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals, this kind of locks some of it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The humic acid locks it up so the plant
can't take it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm using trace minerals that are
sometimes heavier or have higher doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals, that's one that I can
actually use to block it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's nice about, because the
chelation is a multivalent ion with a
[SPEAKER_01]: cation exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another one of those cation exchanges
that it can chelate and change some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: multivalent bonds, ion bonds, and help
with different plants to chelate different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients or to lock things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In more simpler terms, the way I was
explained to it, and you can correct me if
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm wrong on this one, the chelation is
kind of like putting nutrients into an
[SPEAKER_00]: envelope and making it more available for
uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a good way to put it away?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So certain nutrients come in different
forms that are not available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you have calcium or here's a great
one, iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have iron in your soil,
a lot of people are like, oh, it's a heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant's going to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not chelated to an available form,
the plant can take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to use it even though it's
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what a lot of chelation is
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making different nutrients available in a
different form than what they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: BioLive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down to Earth BioLive is the one that I
believe you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have a BioFish and BioThrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a couple different in
their bio lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it is is a different blend of
multiple down to earth amendments from
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp to soybean mill to gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of all these ingredients in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they added was beneficial fungi
and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both endo, ecto, micro, risal,
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different strands of
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them the bacillus, if I recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what I use it for is to get
those endo and ecto, micro, risal,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi in there and not just the arbuscule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's several different ones
that come from different nutrient lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all of them are the same type of
fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or micro risal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to get once again a
biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like my nutrients, I'm trying to do
the same thing in my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that bio line really helps with what
I'm doing in the soil in the soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of, like what we're talking
about today, we haven't really gone into
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the soil biology parts of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these other amendments also
really help with what we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: with not just the diversity in soil
amendments, but the diversity in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're talking about the
microorganisms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about the biology,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The actual microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything in the soil, around the root
zone, that's in the top couple inches of
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil where everything kind of breaks
other nutrients down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where your plants kind of get
their roots to these areas to create
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates for these to do that symbiotic
exchange of nutrients to sugars and carbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the bio live, I'm looking at
it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 5-4-2 NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say that this is more
beneficial just in veg or can this be used
[SPEAKER_00]: in flour as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use it in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It being higher in nitrogen is not an
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are still looking to take up
nitrogen in flour cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not using as much, but yet they're
still using nitrogen to help development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so using that would not be an issue on
either veg or flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other part using it in vet or in flour
would be the beneficial bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're an indoor cultivator,
re-inoculating the soil every so often to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that the species are there,
that the plants, looking for certain ones
[SPEAKER_01]: for certain nutrients to take up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what part of that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where that diversity is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're dying off, you're just
trying to re-inoculate and get them back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the soil at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's switch it up to next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just got some Bokashi using it
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Grokashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the brand, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it from Build-A-Soil and started using
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just sprinkled it like two days ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several different brands on the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several different companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it is just a wheat brand,
oat brand Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it has rice holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it has biochar mixed in with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just depends on the companies that
you're getting it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Elevate Organics is one that does some
rice holes and biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build-A-Soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one that has rice holes in a
wheat brand, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you had Bokashi or if you had
compost at home, you could throw it on and
[SPEAKER_01]: create your own Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what Bokashi is is three to four
strains of anaerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people think anaerobic bacteria is
bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: But these are the ones that are actually
beneficial and good for the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help different functions within the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They help break down different organic
matter and different amendments that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these three or four strands are like
yeast, lactose bacillus, and then like a
[SPEAKER_01]: purple non-sulfur are like what's commonly
found in what Bokashi is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also it's really doing is helping get
fungal communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Bokashi is supposed to help build
fungal communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's weird because it's an anaerobic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me it's the way it breaks down
everything in the soil that the fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: communities then want to come in and start
helping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, it's weird because some
of these fungal, bio, and bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: communities really work symbiotically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll find communities and understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are bad, like different anaerobic
bacteria can be bad and harmful to the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a lot of aerobic biology
help go in the soil, kind of get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bad pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: The anaerobic, if your soil is getting
more oxygen to it, will help get rid of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the bad pathogens in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where understanding the
difference between like these are
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial anaerobic as versus the bad
anaerobic bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one thing about Bokashi is like
really it creates that white mycelium
[SPEAKER_00]: layer right across the soil, which is
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of people hit me up to like,
what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they all panic mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a good thing to see that
mycelium layer across and that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: really helping that break down,
especially when you have it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you top dress it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And have it over those nutrients that you
maybe there's top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably one of the more beneficial
ways to do it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would really help break things down a
little bit quicker because that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: Bokashi is really used for is for
composting, breaking down organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you can create your own
Bokashi at home with a couple of different
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients like blackstrap molasses,
some oat or wheat bran, or rice holes,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then some EM1.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can create your own Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can get Bokashi and sprinkle it on
your compost and let it start breaking it
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you really went and got some yeast
and some brown sugar, molasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you sprinkle that on compost,
it would start breaking it down as well
[SPEAKER_01]: because yeast is part of what Bokashi is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting how you can
create your own Bokashi if you really
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to, or get it started breaking down
your compost from these other companies
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes growing fun too, trying out new
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at the Grokashi directions right
now, just read it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says it can be used as a soil
conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to two percent of total soil volume is
what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could use it as a top dress,
which is what I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third cup per square foot every two
weeks is what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a soil drench, it says use a
third cup per gallon of clean water or
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then let it sit for 24 to 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stir in a tablespoon per gallon of
blackstrap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then strain to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just a couple different ways to use
Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's so interesting is
because it's so versatile on using it for
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients to feed your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, that's one of them that a
lot of people don't know about and kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: overlook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of growers are really interested
in getting these communities, these fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: communities to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what this Bokashi will
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's help with the bacteria, bring these
fungal communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went over 10 different amendments
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when I first started
getting to organics, one of the things is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can be overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just scratched the surface today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went over 10 and there's so many more
beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, kelp meal, alfalfa meal,
insect frass, blood meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a cheat sheet here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feather meal, biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys want a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could even be a part three because
there's really so many because then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the fish and the hydrolyzed fish and
the fish meal and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three different ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's what's so interesting
is I literally have a tote full of
[SPEAKER_01]: probably 20 different products that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody's like, that's a lot,
but I'm looking at it as, I don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: what my plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of them work differently for my
plant and the soil biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all I can do as a home
cultivator, as growing my own fruits and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables is try to give the plants
everything available that they can use for
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient uptake or nutrients in any form
that I can find that's dry and organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't like bottle nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer not to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have shelf lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of these dry organic amendments don't
really have a shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're good until they get decomposed or
broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I really enjoy using like
the down to earth amendments because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're one of them that's pretty
consistent of their product and where I
[SPEAKER_01]: can find them as versus some of these
other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their box is environmentally friendly,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It breaks down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It breaks down, even says compost on the
back of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use the box for compost.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a big compost pile that I have
all kinds of boxes that I've thrown in
[SPEAKER_01]: from making all of these different soil
amendments over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, they break down pretty quickly,
surprisingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that being said, what advice do you
have for somebody who is probably new,
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting their feet wet with organics
and stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice would you have for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the KISS method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look for a couple things that you want to
try.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend some BioLive,
one of those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe a little bit of rock phosphate for
the trace nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either some gypsum or some dolomite lime
just for the calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what's so nice about some of
this down to earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of it's pretty inexpensive and it's
starting to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boxes, I can find gypsum for just about
six bucks, but some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments are around 20 bucks for a five
pound box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get them in 30, 40 pound,
50 pound bags if you want a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me, it's still relatively
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where I can go get three or four items
just to get started and mix them in a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: mix or make a tea with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even do a foliar application with the
solubility of some of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another application that you can do
on a lot of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking them as a newbie, keeping it
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can grab a couple boxes of a couple
ingredients that have some beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some good nutrients and start with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way to not get overwhelmed with
everything that's going on is just start
[SPEAKER_00]: with one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get another one and kind of do your
individual research and apply it as you
[SPEAKER_00]: feel best that you've done your research
on and go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's great advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked over the years where I have 20
boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use them all at one time because
things change during my cycles of what I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the whole point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is I have what I need available for my
plants and it takes time to build it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it didn't just happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole product line, if you had to go
out and purchase the down earth whole
[SPEAKER_01]: product line, you would probably spend
$1,500 to $2,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody can afford to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where a box here, a box there,
and you're only putting a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: tablespoons here, a couple tablespoons
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to last you a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of my boxes, unless I literally have
to make a whole new super soil recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use my, it may take me six months
to get through my box or longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take me a year on some of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time I use a large dose of the
dry organic amendments is when I make a
[SPEAKER_01]: large tee or do super soil amending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bottled nutrients, we talked about that
shelf life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go buy a bottle, it's got to be used
by X amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's not, it's no good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sit around for a year and I'll be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a big benefit there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can the listeners find you and what
do you got upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've got quite a bit going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start off, you can find me on
YouTube, Medically Fit.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 18,000 people following me now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a slow progression on educating
people on the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of great playlist on the
soil amendments where I kind of talk a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more on some of them on there,
as well as you can find me on Instagram or
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabuzz.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need to reach out to me and you
want to message me, best place,
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk to people and chat with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chat with people is on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier for me to find messages there
than it is through YouTube or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to take that back because
you're going to get flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get flooded with
questions, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's OK because I try to answer most
people's questions and help most people
[SPEAKER_01]: out that I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may take me a while to see because
Instagram, if we're not following each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, I have to allow their request to
come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes, it takes me a while to see some
of my messages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually try to help quite a bit of
people out that want a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to at least point them in directions
so they can find some of the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the channel is really for,
is to try to point people in the direction
[SPEAKER_01]: of where to find some of this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done a great job over the years
providing that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your efforts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link Medically Fit's channel down in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on his channel right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also link that nutrient tea video
that I spoke about in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at his playlist, like he said,
he's got one on horticulture, botany,
[SPEAKER_00]: and plant physiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a playlist for soil amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got one for understanding the
benefits of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a lot of educational information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the years, it's just building and
compiling all these different videos I've
[SPEAKER_01]: found.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched and watched over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to have somewhere people can go and
find some of that information.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody asks, I can try to go to one
of those and pull it up and send it to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always nice having a place you can
find references.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Medically Fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming onto the
channel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any final words?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do your research.
[SPEAKER_01]: My job is to turn you guys on to the
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your job from that point on is to do
research and find out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to grow the best plant you
can is to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works different for everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have soil growers, hydro growers,
aquaponic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody has their niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid to try something different
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you, it took you a little while and a
little pushing to try some organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: You finally tried it after a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even sent you some of these videos we're
talking about over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, check this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, check that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely appreciate you pushing me to
wean my way off the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes people sharing the right
information and people willing to listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can lead a horse of water,
but you can't make him drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can provide all the information to my
listeners, but I can't force him to read
[SPEAKER_01]: it or watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Medically Fit, I will let you
go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, and have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You too, and we'll hope to see you all
again.
See you next time.
