[SPEAKER_02]: In the flower tent, I usually have some
type of net, some type of netting in my
[SPEAKER_02]: flower tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a plant gets into that tent and it's
like really starting to get too big,
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of bend it over using that netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pot sizes when I'm flowering,
they vary from like, I guess the three
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon to a five gallon, just depending on
the strain that's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm that grower that's like
borderline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost, break every rule possible or try
to come as close to it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get a strain, it's great at growing
in the desert and you bring it to
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere where it's damp and humid,
you probably gonna mess that strain up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making everything as simple as possible
for you because let's face it,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the day, gardening is not
your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a part of your life, but you have
other stuff to do, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spend your whole time
sitting there babysitting, literally
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the grass grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Mr. Sparksalot, welcome to
Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: So far so good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hanging in there, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I woke up this morning, so I'm blessed,
you know, like my hat say blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm definitely glad that you were
able to tune into the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Join us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually been talking for quite a
while now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's been several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we first found out about each other
online, you know, you have a YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, I have a YouTube channel,
and I know you tuned into my live streams
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tuned into your live streams a couple of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are finally talking face to
face through video chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So appreciate your time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the world has bumped us into each
other once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know who you are,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a small, pretty much home closet
grower, I guess, for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much started in Nevada,
like when we went recreational out here
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was kind of legal for me to grow,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when I first started, it was kind
of still in the gray areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But after it went wreck or before it went
wreck, I got my medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it went wreck out here,
stuff kind of got a little bit more legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of started growing just to,
I guess, get my feet wet a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But shortly after I started growing,
I started reading a little bit more upon
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains, medicinal strains,
and kind of in hopes to find, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: an aid for my mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like she's got some health issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at one point in time, she was on
around seven or eight different
[SPEAKER_02]: medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started making her like oil or I
would make her edibles and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she would use that and pretty much
alleviate her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She got rid of the majority of the
prescriptions that she was taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just kind of made me feel good to be
able to produce something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could almost say in your own backyard,
I don't have a backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in my closet in this instance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you can grow something,
kind of on-site or produce something
[SPEAKER_02]: on-site that's not necessarily chemically
altered.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not in the science coat with the
beakers and everything, sitting up messing
[SPEAKER_02]: with nature, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it just makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been pretty much in love with it
ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here I am now, I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had more space.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of these days, hopefully I'll be able
to kind of, I guess, expand or at least
[SPEAKER_02]: upgrade a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for my space and area, I just kind of
make do with what I have, take it from
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've been doing it since 2016,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have over 3000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you do like live streams,
you do chill smoke sessions, garden
[SPEAKER_00]: updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a variety of things on your
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that are watching this or
are tuned in to YouTube in particular,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link to his channel down in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, such as Apple podcasts or
[SPEAKER_00]: Spotify, just go to YouTube and type in
MrSparksalot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spelled S-P-A-R-K-Z-A-L-O-T.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll be able to find his
channel and check out what he has there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we get into the nitty gritty on
your grow tent setup and growing in small
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces, I really wanna first address what
you have as your primary goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody has their goals for their
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you talk to me eight to 10 years ago,
I would have told you my primary goal was
[SPEAKER_00]: to obtain as high of a yield as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not everybody's goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people jump to the assumption
that everybody's goal is a high yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really the case for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days I'm focused mostly on
simplicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I make things easier in the garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've also been focusing on efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reducing that electrical consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say your goals are?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your primary goals for your
garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first started off, I was kind of
like you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I wanted that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just pushing for two things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I wanted to save myself some
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as far as I wouldn't have to go
out and buy that bag as much, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, or that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my main goal is just, I guess,
yield, you know, to try to get as much as
[SPEAKER_02]: I could.
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the years, I'm kind of straight
away from that for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially trying to work more with like
medicinal strains and trying to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: zone in on the strain from my mother.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been more just like quality for me
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yield, I mean, yield is good, but if you
have a pound of something that's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: eh, compared to, you know, a half a pound
or a quarter pound of something,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's a one or, you know, top notch.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I guess it's all up to the person
at the end of the day, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but overall now, my overall, I guess,
expectation out of the garden is just like
[SPEAKER_02]: my quality for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to make sure everything, you know,
kind of just runs smoothly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, like I started growing around
the LED era.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't have to go through the HPS and
HID and all these extra other lights that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the old school growers went
through kind of with them higher
[SPEAKER_02]: electricity bills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, I haven't like grown with
LEDs for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really haven't seen like a super jump in
my electricity bill in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as I said, you know, I don't run a
huge goal either, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if I guess it got to the
point to where my electricity was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: getting out of hand, you know,
I would kind of keep that in mind that,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, I need to kind of make this as
efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because ironically, as the times are going
on and, you know, as more places legalize,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the cost of stuff is going down a
lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, in some instances,
it almost might be easier for,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not trying to discourage anybody
from growing, but if you're paying more in
[SPEAKER_02]: electricity and, you know, items for your
grow and more to keep up with it,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it would cost you to go to your local
produce market or dispensary or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it kind of defeats the purpose
unless you're doing it with a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose, you know, such as breeding or you
just want variety or something that you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't get, you know, where you're at at
the moment in time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like for the most part,
I like to concentrate on the quality of
[SPEAKER_02]: the product, you know, especially working
with Strange trying to help ease my mom's
[SPEAKER_02]: ailments and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just want her to have the
best.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I'm trying to get her to name
brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to get her to generic that
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get her, you know, make the best
brand possible for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just to piggyback off of the
whole efficiency thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're have a small grow,
I mean, that's, you're not going to really
[SPEAKER_00]: worry much about it as long as you,
you're running the appropriate equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: within there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of to get into your gross set up,
you know, we'll get into the topic today,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is indoor gardening and a small grow
tent, or really any small spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you could say this can apply to,
so let's talk about your current gross
[SPEAKER_00]: setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you grow in a smaller tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me a little bit about
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Set up like what size grow space,
lighting equipment you have in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, currently I have a two by two by
two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a square or a cube for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use that for my germinating and maybe
keeping like starting seeds or keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: cuts around for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes I have the problem of
overgrowing because of my space being so
[SPEAKER_02]: confined.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of times, especially some of my
keepers, my mom's strain in particular
[SPEAKER_02]: likes to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't keep that thing trimmed,
it's just like she'll try to grow out of
[SPEAKER_02]: the tent, you know, and there's not a lot
of space in most two by twos to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, it's it's advised to
grow like one or two plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two is kind of pushing it in a two by two,
like one plant, will give you probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: best yield as long as you, you know,
kind of scrawl it out or make your canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice and even as even as possible,
you know, but my two by two by two is a
[SPEAKER_02]: germination tent and I'm running just
regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a four bay like it was a T5 setup or
T3 something like that, but I found some
[SPEAKER_02]: LED bulbs for it, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of reducing the electricity
usage of the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really haven't noticed any, I guess,
yield difference in that specific tent,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we are talking about a small like a
small area and, you know, the light's not
[SPEAKER_02]: the I forget how many watts my my little
four bay light thing is, but I've had it
[SPEAKER_02]: for the longest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if it's not broke,
don't fix it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But outside of that, and in my cause that
I have to two by two by I think they're
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not quite six feet because I'm
taller than the tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they might be like five and a half or
five, nine, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I use one for germinating and one for
not germinating one for beds, the others
[SPEAKER_02]: for flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just kind of rotate, you know,
I I attempt to keep a perpetual grow goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as I can every once in a
while, something will happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I might have to restart or
whatever, you know, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to keep that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something in a germination
tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something in beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always something flower,
you know, but my my primary goal is to get
[SPEAKER_02]: it to where like I could harvest once
every other month.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just it's like I have the schedule
and I know what to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just never works.
[SPEAKER_02]: out for me because it's kind of depending
on the strangers themselves and how far
[SPEAKER_02]: along the cuts are and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's it's it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, I keep something in each
one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as lighting goes, I've been
approached by a few different lighting
[SPEAKER_02]: companies to, you know, review lights and
this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in the veg tent right now,
I'm running the Mars, want to say TS 600
[SPEAKER_02]: or something of that nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in my flower tent and I got the
viper specter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're probably they see that they're
probably mad.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can't tell the name of our life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I don't have it written down right
now, but I do have videos from on my
[SPEAKER_02]: channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, any time I get a new light
or something, I do a unboxing or review.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I have a promo code or anything
like that, you know, I'll put it all in
[SPEAKER_02]: the description of my video.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think both of my flower lights are
considered one thousand watt LEDs or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not the highest end,
you know, but they're not like the lowest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my yields are fairly decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, I'm not I'm not really
trying to push that pound of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: envelope.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm more like I said earlier,
I want that the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to clarify that when you say a
thousand watts, you're talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent of a thousand one HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, it's around one hundred watts
is true wattage for some of these some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these Chinese manufacturers, they'll say a
thousand watt in the title, but it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be a thousand one equivalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of controversy behind all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as you know, in a two foot by
two foot grotem, when you're flowering in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you mentioned that one plant,
sometimes two plants, you think sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants is pushing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you have two plants in there,
what size grow pot do you typically use
[SPEAKER_00]: and what type do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it plastic, fabric?
[SPEAKER_02]: Idealistically, I would like to keep one
plant in my flower tent, but I can't like
[SPEAKER_02]: just because of the fact that I like
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a must that I keep at least one
of my mom's plants and flower pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: at all times so I can kind of keep up with
her.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't want to call it
medicine, but herbal supplement,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I pushed the envelope in my two
by two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I, depending on pot size,
a lot of times I put anywhere from one to
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe four plants in my two by two,
and I can fit four or five gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, one in each corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's, is it the best decision?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to, you know, I'm not
telling you to do this at home,
[SPEAKER_02]: kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is just something that works for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I know that it could be
better if I put that one plant in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my yield might be a little bit
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to me, it's just like I said,
I'm a stickler for variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to have some flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I kind of get tired of using the
same thing over and over again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they call it burnt out or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like a little bit of variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's one of the reasons you go
to the beer aisle and it's a million beers
[SPEAKER_02]: right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we all just wanted one type of
beer in the world, then it would just be
[SPEAKER_02]: one beer, but there's not, there's a
variety and I like variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to keep a couple of different
plants in there, but my pot sizes when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering, they vary from like,
I guess the three gallon to a five gallon,
[SPEAKER_02]: just depending on the strain that's in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of my strains, my mom's strains,
the heavier feeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually keep that in a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, some of the other strains
that I know aren't as heavy feeders,
[SPEAKER_02]: I might get away with putting a three
gallon in there and I've had it a time
[SPEAKER_02]: three, five gallons and then two,
three gallons in my plant, in my tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, I'm a bad landlord.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just likes to pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need as many tenants in my garden as I
can get, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do plastic pots or fabric pots,
air pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you in soil or cocoa or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in soil pretty much since I
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried cocoa, running cocoa straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried running, you know, like
different mixtures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran organic, like I made a super soil
probably about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the name of the book,
but I think his name is The Rev or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, True Living Organics by The Rev.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked that book up a while back and
made one of the, super soils or whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to call it from in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in all honesty, I just watered that
specific grill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was probably some of the best
quality that I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the batch of soil that I made,
like it kind of cost me a little pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: penny to get that match together.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the time, you know, I had a lot of
synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had a couple of people,
every time I go to the the hydro store out
[SPEAKER_02]: here, you know, they're always piling
stuff off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you here to try this or this,
you know, giving you samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know I've ran general hydro,
I've ran Sweet Leafs products where like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those are supposed to be on the
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not a hundred percent organic,
but it's kind of a organic based synthetic
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is such a thing, I mean,
there are people that will kind of argue
[SPEAKER_02]: up and down with that nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I pretty much tried it all,
you know, just to kind of get the
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with different nutrients and
different mediums in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always kind of tried to want to do a
hydro grow, but unfortunately I'm in an
[SPEAKER_02]: apartment on the second floor and I'm
super paranoid about leaks and stuff going
[SPEAKER_02]: downstairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I was downstairs, it'd probably be
different, but I don't want to go through
[SPEAKER_02]: all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until I, you know, either move into a
single level area where I could kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: try that out, you know, it's just been
pretty much cocoa or some type of Fox farm
[SPEAKER_02]: soil or local soil from the Home Depot or
whatever, whatever I can kind of get my
[SPEAKER_02]: hands on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after a while I tried to, or not try
to, I try to recycle as much as my soil as
[SPEAKER_02]: I can as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I try to clean out, you know,
any root matter or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first started doing it,
I wasn't flushing it, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a lot of buildup in my soil
from like, you know, past grows or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned the hard way, you know,
I ate up some plants, just burnt,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, burnt them by overfeeding them
because I was feeding them on top of
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever was in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I learned a lot of just
different dos and don'ts over the years
[SPEAKER_02]: because it doesn't matter how many books
you read at the end of the day on the
[SPEAKER_02]: subject matter until you get your hands in
that dirt or that water or on the plant.
So, you know, I learned a lot of different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned a lot about the pots itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's nothing like the actual
experience itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but you mentioned pots too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've had fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've ran, I guess like wetted pots,
plastic pots, air, I think they're air
[SPEAKER_02]: pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much just been trial and
error with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I guess if I had my choice,
I love fabric pots, but cleaning those
[SPEAKER_02]: things, you know, especially if you're
not, if you don't catch those like right
[SPEAKER_02]: before they start to kind of grow,
they're not supposed to grow through the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they're supposed to kind of air
prune roots wise, but they don't always
[SPEAKER_02]: happen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've had those pots kind of when
I feed from the bottom or just water like
[SPEAKER_02]: my catch tray and let the fabric pot soak
up the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been instances where I've had a
little bit too much water in the tray or a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it does help with air pruning a little
bit, but it doesn't like alleviate the
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, you know, and getting that plant
out of there was like a pain in the butt
[SPEAKER_02]: because I ended up kind of pruning the
roots myself, pulling it away from the pot
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever, you know, but I've tried to
use it all, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's out there, I want to use it,
see it, you know, try it, whether I stick
[SPEAKER_02]: with it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other thing, but you know,
at least I can say, yeah, I've tried that
[SPEAKER_02]: product or I've tried that method.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've attempted that, you know,
I've tried the like the plastic bags from
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're okay, but I've always had to put
like more holes in them because once you
[SPEAKER_02]: fill them and they sit right, it's like
the drainage isn't proper.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I don't know if they thought about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure somebody has,
but I don't know, maybe I should come out
[SPEAKER_02]: with my own grow bags with enough holes in
them to drain properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Innovation for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you're growing in these small
spaces, right, these small or grow tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you mostly growing auto flowers or
photo period?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I've grown one auto flower in the
six or whatever, five, six years that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: been growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't too pleased with the yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: In general, and to me, I like the photo
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something about that hunt,
like, you know, popping seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: growing the plant for a little while,
trying to figure out, hey, is this a boy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this a girl?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like playing the guessing game.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like being pregnant,
so to speak, you know, not knowing if it,
[SPEAKER_02]: is it a boy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a girl?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, and then that kind of
moment of truth after you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: start the flower, the plant out to see,
or sex the plant, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and that moment of truth when
you actually see, it's like getting your
[SPEAKER_02]: ultrasound.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's a boy or it's a girl?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see those female hairs or
the male sex coming off the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just something about that that has
a little bit more allure to me than just,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, this is going to be a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be this strain, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that, but that's not to say that I
won't ever grow them again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm having too much fun along my
journey right now with, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: photo period, you know, plants to even get
to that point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along my journey, I've made a couple,
I think I've made like 10 crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't stabilized anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm not a quote unquote breeder
as much as I aspire to be one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it takes time to kind of get there,
you know, but I've had people ask me,
[SPEAKER_02]: about some of the crosses that I made.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do you ever think about feminizing
those or making autos?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 10, 15 years ago, these auto
flowers, the genetics, they stayed pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some may say, hey, that's good for
small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, I mean, I've had some autos
that blew up like crazy, like four feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: five feet easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hear a lot of people saying that auto
flowers are good for small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I wouldn't necessarily
agree with that photo period, you get that
[SPEAKER_00]: control to where you can keep it small via
training, which we'll talk about in a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're able to change that light
cycle and flip the flower to force
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering versus the auto flower could
blow up in the first 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you've got height
issues and you've got another three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: to stretch on top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be, it could get out of hand
pretty crazy, but it comes down to a
[SPEAKER_00]: preference thing, I feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going into, transplanting,
I want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you're in three to five
gallon containers typically, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your final container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically start out, correct me if I'm
wrong, you typically will start out in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller like solo cup, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I believe you transplant up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go directly into that three or five
gallon container or are you going to a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon container and then your final
container?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when do you typically do that
transplanting?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for the most part, if it's a seed,
then I'm not going to be sure of the six
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually go to like a one gallon or I've
been known to go to like a half gallon,
[SPEAKER_02]: just depending on what I started out at.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started out seeds like in like a
clone tray for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I feel the clone tray up with where I
guess they might be propagation trays.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what to call them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fill those up with, you know,
soil or some type of median and just put
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds in there and then kind of what that
being so small, I can go into a solo cup
[SPEAKER_02]: after that and then maybe like a half
gallon and then a one gallon or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a clone of something and I know
it's a female or whatever, sometimes I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: go from once it gets rooted into the
biggest pot, you know, or sometimes I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: go to that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really just depends on the space in my
garden, like the space and what's moving
[SPEAKER_02]: around where it really depicts on,
depicts what I kind of put stuff in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, for the most part, because I
used to keep like a five gallon pot in my
[SPEAKER_02]: veg tent as a mother plant from our mom's
stream.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up like cloning the mess out
of that plant because she was getting like
[SPEAKER_02]: way too big for the tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up dropping that down to two
and a half gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it's like I have to almost clone
her twice as often because ironically
[SPEAKER_02]: enough, it's like I almost feel like she's
growing faster now in a smaller area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's a lot more like susceptible to
stuff going wrong, like her drying out or
[SPEAKER_02]: being over or under nutrient, being over
or under fed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that five gallon pot to me is like the
sweet spot, but it affects my space in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really just depends on the strains
that I'm running and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of space that I have in there
or kind of, I told you, I'm that mean
[SPEAKER_02]: landlord.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to stick everybody in there
like sardines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it affects my grow,
especially with some of the, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation, you know, sometimes a lot,
sometimes I get that overlap where your
[SPEAKER_02]: leaves are, you know, this plant might be
kind of overlapping the plant next to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as much as I don't want it to affect
that grow, like your plants need as much
[SPEAKER_02]: energy as they can from that light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with me running LEDs, you know,
it's, I'm just kind of pushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of like to push the envelope a
little bit more, but I know that,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I said, if I put one plant in there,
I can get a bigger yield off of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just try to keep as much in there as
I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can get, you know, just kind of keep
all my bases covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I went, I ran a seven gallon
fabric pot one time, I think in my tent or
[SPEAKER_02]: it wasn't something here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the tent I was doing offsite for
one of my partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really didn't see any difference
yield wise or like size wise from running
[SPEAKER_02]: the same plant in a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really didn't do a scientific,
I didn't measure both yields and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was being fed and the lighting,
there was two different lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's possible that the bigger median
area gave off a bigger yield, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I don't know, I really don't see a big
difference between the yield and like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess when I did that five gallon and
the seven gallon, but I noticed when I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I flower out in like either two and a
half or three gallon or a five gallon,
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's a big difference in yield
there, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I said, I just, I wanted to try it
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's my sweet spot for the
most part is like flower, I like to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you know, a flower out in a
five gallon veg is anywhere from a half
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon to maybe a two and a half gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in germination, you know,
I think I have like some little pint size
[SPEAKER_02]: pots that like you get when you go Home
Depot and buy your little starter
[SPEAKER_02]: seedlings or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bunch of those off the show that I
did a long time ago that some folks were
[SPEAKER_02]: getting rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of left up on that, but I'm
almost like you, whatever's around because
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had, you know, I've tried so much of
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sometimes I look in my tent and
there's a fabric pot, a five gallon Home
[SPEAKER_02]: Depots, you know, paint bucket that I put
holes in and a couple of plastic bags and
[SPEAKER_02]: this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, man, you have the,
just the throw to garden over here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it works, you know, and at the end of
the day, I think that's all you can do is
[SPEAKER_02]: do what works best for you, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going back to plant training,
you know, when you're in small spaces,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have height restrictions, you have
space restrictions just in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do for plant
training in order to keep those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, small within that growth space?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually in the germination stage,
I really don't do too much to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, as they're seedlings or small
cuttings, I really don't do too much to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if I do have a seedling,
to me, I feel it's growing a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might like crop it or super crop it,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cut the top nodes off once it gets past
like its fifth set of leaves or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll let it sit maybe a germination
tent for probably about another week
[SPEAKER_02]: before I put it in the veg tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the veg tent, I mean, I've used
anything from what they call it garden
[SPEAKER_02]: tape, like the green garden tape and kind
of, you know, loosely taped around limbs
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of bent them down and taped it to
the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if I'm using a plastic pot in
that instance, I've used string in the
[SPEAKER_02]: past to kind of tie, you know,
branches down to kind of slow them from
[SPEAKER_02]: growing as high as fast and promoting,
I guess, a bushier canopy as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the flower tent, I usually have some
type of net, some type of netting in my
[SPEAKER_02]: flower tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I need, if a plant gets into that
tent and is like really starting to get
[SPEAKER_02]: too big, I kind of bend it over using that
netting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also use the netting for kind of spacing
and trying to just get my, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: get every piece of the plant just kind of
spread out so it gets that as even as
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of lighting as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times, like when you grow from
seed, you have that uniform kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: Christmas tree structure with the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And assuming you don't top it,
or anything like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you do top it and kind of train it a
little bit more, I guess you can spread
[SPEAKER_02]: that canopy out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes from seed, I like to just
let it grow like that first one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just let it grow to see, I guess,
some of the plant's structure in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the node spacing and how,
I guess, fast it grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case, the net really comes in
handy because I can kind of spread,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, the branches and the arms of your
plant out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you, you know, do other training
methods as far as, I guess, super cropping
[SPEAKER_02]: and low stress training and whatnot,
it just, the netting in there in my flower
[SPEAKER_02]: tent, it helps, I guess, keep everything
at bay as well as keep your canopy even,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with some of the strains, I grew a
lemon tree strain out not too long ago,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was like super spindly almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a very, I guess, bulky type of
strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of dainty on the dainty side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was just that specific
cut or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in that case, it's almost like I
needed the netting to kind of hold the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant up once it got so big because the
branches were like smaller than my pinky,
[SPEAKER_02]: just small branches, super thin,
almost wispy, like it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flower was decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the plant structure and everything to
me, it just wasn't something that I would
[SPEAKER_02]: keep, you know, in my garden for the most
part, especially if I was trying to take
[SPEAKER_02]: it outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that thing would probably fly
away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked like a tumbleweed, you know,
crossing the road or something out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you said about the topping and
then low stress training from there,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I typically do now,
especially when I'm trying to stay in a
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried so many different training
methods over the years, just about
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you know, topping,
fimming, supercropping, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, when I'm trying to keep it
small in small spaces, I will do that
[SPEAKER_00]: topping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I'll let it grow up to like the
fifth node, the third node, fourth node,
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll top the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes depending on growth,
if it has real long inner nodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it from the fifth node,
top it down to the third node.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will remove some of that growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, I'll allow it to grow and
I'll bend down those branches to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, keep it small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even canopy, like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like how you mentioned the netting in
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That definitely would help in a small
space, you know, bending those branches
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the netting and then
supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I personally like to do is even when
using the netting, sometimes some shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: will grow up taller than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll super crop in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually when I'm in that
stretch period, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flipped a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now things are growing up in the netting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some growing more than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the first like two weeks or so,
three weeks or so, I'll do some
[SPEAKER_00]: supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically what I'll do in smaller
spaces in order to try to keep things
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically use for base
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what type of water do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use filtered water, tap water,
well water, distilled water?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing I could say I've
almost tried it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out with tap water from my sink,
like before I, as a novice, I mean a
[SPEAKER_02]: complete novice from back in the day,
I was just running tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was one of those guys,
oh, you just need the water, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I had to sit down and kind of
learn this trade, you know, via YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: and books and other social media platforms
and a couple of friends or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of it was trial and error,
just getting, kind of doing it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, getting your hands in that dirt,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, from tap water, I bought a pH
fan and a TDS meter or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the first time I took the
readings on like my local tap water or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, I want to say my tap water came
out at like 420, 410 parts per million or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't tell you what the pH was on it,
you know, at the time or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once I figured that out, I went and I
got the Amazon, I bought an RO filter off
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was running that for a while,
you know, so I could get that zero parts
[SPEAKER_02]: per million neutral water in order to add
my synthetic ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when I first started off,
I was overfeeding my plants and I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like when I started, I was using General
Hydro and they have like a feeding chart
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can download offline.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be on some of their products as
well, but I ended up downloading it
[SPEAKER_02]: offline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And being new, I kind of wanted to get the
best, you know, I wanted the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the guy at the hydroponics store,
you know, saw my young guppy fish and
[SPEAKER_02]: reeled me in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I ended up buying like the advanced
products, which is like, and so like in
[SPEAKER_02]: the top of each week, it gives you like a
PPM number of once you mix the
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredients, the nutrients, like your PPM
should be around whatever level,
[SPEAKER_02]: like 800 or 400 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I was starting off with 420 tap
water and then adding however,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, many parts per million,
depending on what week it was,
[SPEAKER_02]: like I would always be at least at 420
parts per million over.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was way overfeeding my plants in the
beginning, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I got the RO filter, but after
using that for probably, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say I used that about a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one of my buddies did point it
out to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was like, man, you ever, you know,
notice how much water that thing wastes?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't, and I ended up hooking the
runoff, you know, of the RO filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't hook it up into anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a hose that comes off, but I ended
up draining that into like, a container
[SPEAKER_02]: and I kept like measuring that out to
every gallon of water that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not mistaken, my RO filter was
wasting, it was either three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons of water in order for me to get
one gallon of, you know, zero water or
[SPEAKER_02]: neutral water for the matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, it's like when you're paying
for four gallons or three gallons for that
[SPEAKER_02]: matter to get one gallon, of, you know,
purified water, I just, I kind of stopped
[SPEAKER_02]: using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I went into buying like purified
water from local places, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: going to fill up a five gallon jug here
and there or whatever I needed water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, I just kind of,
I started using tap water again,
[SPEAKER_02]: but instead of doing a full feeding or
whatever nutrients that I'm using,
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually like cut that in either a half
or like a quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that kind of offsets that whatever
parts per million or what's in my water,
[SPEAKER_02]: the negative about that though is at any
given moment, you know, in our,
[SPEAKER_02]: your city tap water, there could be
whatever nutrients, you know, they try to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it at a parts per million at a very
low, I guess rate, but you never know
[SPEAKER_02]: what's in your water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there iron?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there iron from the pipes in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there more copper or zinc or whatever's
in the water?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I always try to let it sit for a
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So any chlorine and I guess chloramine or
whatever will kind of evaporate off of
[SPEAKER_02]: there before I use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been having a fairly decent look
doing it that way, you know, but I'd like
[SPEAKER_02]: to go back to doing the RO water if I
could find a better RO filter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even at the end of the day,
I mean, I think I've looked on Amazon and
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got up to like the one-to-one
ratios, but there's something about
[SPEAKER_02]: wasting a gallon of water to get a good
gallon of water to me at the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: day, that it just doesn't seem right,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three gallons to one gallon, one gallon to
three gallons is about right for the RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm in the same boat as you,
as far as the waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had a podcast with somebody
else, Doggo the Hutt, not sure if you know
[SPEAKER_00]: who he is, but he had mentioned that he
takes his, the drain line and he'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually use it on his outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not wasting that additional water,
which I thought was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I'm transitioning
onto.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, as far as you don't know what's
in your water, the chlorine letting it sit
[SPEAKER_00]: out for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it dissipates, chlorine will,
chloramine won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, luckily we live in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have chloramine in our local
water, but there are some places that do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for anybody watching that, you might
want to check your local water report,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if you have chlorine or chloramine,
because you would take different routes
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you can just filter out the
chloramine if you had chloramine instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically run for temperature
and humidity in your small grow spaces?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is another one of those questions
that a lot of people are going to probably
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I'm that grower that's like
borderline.
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost break every rule possible or try
to come as close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the ideal humidity is, what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the ideal temperature is in between 80,
what, 86 and something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm in Vegas, it's hot as hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I have the two by two tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two of those and I pretty much let
my tent do what it does.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my air conditioning on,
my house at 78.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it kind of goes off the ambient
temperature of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also run my LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it usually doesn't get over maybe 90 in
my tent, which it's high, it's pushing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the summertime, I've seen it go over
that, but I'll usually just kick the air
[SPEAKER_02]: down a little bit more and it'll kind of
keep those temperatures down.
[SPEAKER_02]: The LEDs work a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not alleviate all your heat,
but it does work a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I didn't really come up in
that light bulb grow generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have to do the HIDs or the
ballasts or all that extra stuff that I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess are a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know they've busted gorilla grows for
temperature readings because of the lights
[SPEAKER_02]: being so hot back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to say that they couldn't do it maybe
with these LEDs, but I think you'd have to
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot more or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just kind of let my tents,
just humidity wise, whatever it is in
[SPEAKER_02]: there, I think it's the watering and the
feeding days or I guess the days that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: as humid as it's going to get in my tents
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my thermometer for the most,
it always reads like low humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have a humidifier in the box sitting
in my closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I bought it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One day I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to fix my humidity issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I got home and I'm looking at both my
tents and I'm like one humidifier,
[SPEAKER_02]: two tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to think of a way I could rig
something up to it and port it to both
[SPEAKER_02]: tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, maybe I'll go buy another one and put
it in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, in a two by two,
by the time you put a humidifier in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless it's mounted, hanging up something,
which I'm not even going to try to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, to keep that humidity at the
ideal temperature, but, or the ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: rating, but I just weigh it, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it is, you know, I keep my
thermostat in my house on 78 year round,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, summertime, winter time,
whatever it's always 78 in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been lucky enough that I guess my
ambient temperature kind of keeps my tent
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures at bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do know that, you know, it could be
a lot better if it was a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just, it's, to me, it's not that big
of an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I could, I would probably see a
better outcome at the end of the day if my
[SPEAKER_02]: plants weren't idealistic temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, let's face it, this plant
grows from California to Uzbekistan or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever way you don't on the other side
of the planet, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get the right strain in your
garden, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures and all that other stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you get a picky strain or,
you know, if you get a strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's great at growing in the desert and
you bring it to somewhere where it's damp
[SPEAKER_02]: and humid, you probably gonna mess that
strain up, but, you know, due to the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something else that I kind of
incorporate into my crosses and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: is our temperature out here, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the past, I've made kind of testers
and sent them out and hey, let me know how
[SPEAKER_02]: they do in your neck of the woods,
so to speak, because I wanna know in
[SPEAKER_02]: different environments, you know,
how something that I'm growing out here
[SPEAKER_02]: may vary, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just try to keep it as cool as I can
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, on each of my tents,
like the flat down part that covers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess your zippers or whatnot at the
top, like I wrote the idealistic
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 86 to... From everything I've read,
82 degrees leaf surface temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: said to be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if your canopy temperature is a
little bit higher than that, your leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature might be a little bit
lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people will run up to 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people running up to 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried 87 in the past, but I've seen,
you know, heat stress issues on my plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I've lowered it down, but I usually aim
for about 80 to 82 leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like you said before, the plant is
gonna grow outside of the ideal ranges for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is very resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see problems and you might not
see optimal growth, but the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: still grow for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with humidity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in the same area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We struggle with, I think at the natural
humidity level is about 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy, crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that humidifier in there,
I have three humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one in my lung room, which I was
gonna recommend to you is just having like
[SPEAKER_00]: the room that your grow tents are in,
maybe just control that at the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way, when you're exhausting out,
you're bringing in that ideal humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: level that might work because you're stuck
with space constraints, not being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: put that humidifier in those small grow
tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But typically for humidity, I'll have like
a higher humidity when the plant is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the seedling stage,
vegetation stage, 65 to 85, maybe when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's super young, then I'll slowly reduce
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then flowering, you know, 40 to 60% is
a general range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that kind of goes against VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's optimal range is VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, again, the plant is gonna grow
outside of those ideal ranges for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Idealistically, I would like to have all
my tents in one room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just I'm in a two bedroom kind of like
roommate style apartment and everything is
[SPEAKER_02]: cramped in my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's temperature wise, you can tell
like the difference between a living room
[SPEAKER_02]: and my room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's almost like walking out
into the sun from the shade, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: that drastic of a change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, if it's 90 degrees
outside and you're under some shade,
[SPEAKER_02]: it doesn't feel like 90, it might feel
like that 85 or, you know, lower 80 or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in the sun, yeah,
it's gonna feel like that 90, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and my room is, it's always kind of
pushing that temperature, that high
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature of the house because of the
fact that the tents are in here,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lights are on, you know, and I try to
keep the majority of the stuff running at
[SPEAKER_02]: night just to kind of keep it cooler in
here and just, I guess, kind of find a
[SPEAKER_02]: median zone for my temperature in general,
because if, you know, if I ran these
[SPEAKER_02]: lights in the daytime, oh my gosh,
it'd probably be ridiculously,
[SPEAKER_02]: my power bill would probably jump up a lot
more just to my electricity as far as my
[SPEAKER_02]: air conditioning consuming a lot more to
keep it cooler in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anybody that's been in my room ever,
they're always like, why is it so hot in
[SPEAKER_02]: here?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you know, in the first place,
we live in a desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not hot in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think it's hot, go outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I aim to get into everything in the one
room sooner or later, if I can get a three
[SPEAKER_02]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I like to get a house and,
you know, I got to grow stuff all
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout my apartment kind of scattered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's old stuff in a bin over
here and, you know, my master bathroom
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of has the majority of my nutrients
and some spare pots and whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to get everything in one
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just kind of concentrate on that one
specific area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should see me sometimes I'm
transplant, I got to go in this room to
[SPEAKER_02]: get a pot and over here to get,
you know, some great white or some type of
[SPEAKER_02]: root inoculant or something, you know,
and it's just like, man, if everything was
[SPEAKER_02]: in one spot, I wouldn't have to do all
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's my goal sooner or later is just
to get everything in one spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or my child is going to have
to hurry up and turn 18 so I can kick her
[SPEAKER_02]: out and take her.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just playing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not kicking her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: She's probably gonna be the one to take
care of my old self when I turn however
[SPEAKER_02]: old and can't do it no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would definitely be easier to
have everything all in one area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that being said, you know, we went over
a decent amount of stuff in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything you can think about in regards
to growing in small spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice would you have for somebody
who's new to growing in small spaces?
[SPEAKER_02]: Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you research, do you research,
do you research, you know, unless you're
[SPEAKER_02]: daddy warbucks and you got money to blow
wasting on trying to do everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, gardening in general can be the
most simplistic thing in the world or can
[SPEAKER_02]: be the most complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of what you make out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you got some guys out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you mentioned you're trying to get
down to simplicity and efficiency and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, making everything as simple as
possible for you because let's face it,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end of the day, gardening is not
your life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a part of your life, but you have
other stuff to do, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to spend your whole time
sitting there babysitting, literally
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the grass grow, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just do as much research as you can,
figure out what style, if any,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you kind of want to hone in on
because there is a lot of growth styles
[SPEAKER_02]: out there, you know, and some style might
be better for you and your environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: your atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just do some research.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, YouTube is, as long as you have
internet, I mean, that's YouTube helped me
[SPEAKER_02]: out a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: People like Mr. Grow It and, oh my gosh,
I'm having brain farts right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that I learned from is probably
like this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a large community on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've kind of started seeking out a little
bit more knowledge as far as the gardening
[SPEAKER_02]: community in general, because last year I
bought a two by four by like five and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half, 10, and I started indoor gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm trying to alleviate like some of
the fruits and vegetables or at least the
[SPEAKER_02]: vegetables that I buy, tomatoes and
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm always at the store getting
because their shelf life is and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, long for the most part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I can take that, eliminate that cost
and grow up myself here, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can always have stuff for salads and
herbs and spices and whatnot around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of let me branch out my
gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can grow your own fruits and
vegetables or a little bit of substance
[SPEAKER_02]: for yourself, that's one less thing you
got to worry about, you know, if the,
[SPEAKER_02]: if the S ever hits the fan at the end of
the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's really good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on just about every social platform,
some more than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube probably has the biggest
collection of my work, I guess,
[SPEAKER_02]: videos, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, you know, I have, I guess,
of course, photos on their short videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Facebook, I'm on just about anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you Google my name, Mr. Squarks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll lowercase either with the at sign or
without it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty sure it'll pull up just about
anything that I'm on social media wise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I have an account for just
about everything, Twitter and Snapchat and
[SPEAKER_02]: this and that, and I can't keep up with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting old, you know, but just at Mr.
Sparks a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a website, I believe it's www
.irecreations.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's I also.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will pull up some of the things that
I kind of offer some of my merchandise,
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Sparks about gear, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, just about just Google me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mr. Sparks, I thank you so much for
coming on to the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, for those watching again,
I'll link his channel down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you watching on YouTube,
I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
And I'll see you next time.
