[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parfect Works sent me over their 1000W
Cree Cobb Plus LED Growlite and in this
[SPEAKER_00]: video I'm going to unbox the unit,
I will test the power output and I'll do a
[SPEAKER_00]: heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the
features that this growlite has but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: link it in the description section below
so you can learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out the box here is a wire
hanging kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is another wire hanging kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is a power cord and lastly is the LED
growlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389nm to 692nm
and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these videos just to give you a
general idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetative coverage area for this
growlite is 4 foot by 4 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to the Amazon listing the
flowering coverage area is 4 foot by 3
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: However I was told that the flowering
coverage area was 3 foot by 3 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I show you the measurements you'll
see that I'm keeping my power meter in a 3
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by 3 foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the recommended distances listed
on their Amazon listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches, 30 inches and 40 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the LED growlite into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 3.26 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 383 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just reminded that there is a link to this
growlite in the description section below
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
