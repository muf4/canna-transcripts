[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you use phosphorus that is impure,
you already see that what you put in into
[SPEAKER_00]: your fertilizers is not 100% available to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over application of phosphorus is
definitely a problem, both indoors as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as with big agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to hear how many myths there
are and also like how many myths are
[SPEAKER_00]: spread by some really big companies in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium is crucial in both veg as well
as flour, and it is actually the only
[SPEAKER_00]: element that is not part of an organelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the binding when it comes to
fertilizers, it is being done through a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of pressure, heat and a catalyzer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all has to do with filtration
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How clean is the raw material that you
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: As nutrients manufacturers and brands,
we should be open and transparent about
[SPEAKER_00]: what's inside the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr.GrowIt,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 44.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Rico from
Dutch Pro Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks all about how nutrients are
sourced and some forms of nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: should be avoided.
[SPEAKER_01]: We aren't able to get into all of the
nutrients used by plants, but we do get
[SPEAKER_01]: into a small chunk of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that we'll have a part two of
this in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast or Patreon.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Rico from Dutch Pro
Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I'm excited for the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Christmas is coming up soon,
so we already put up the Christmas trees
[SPEAKER_00]: here in the office.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited for this episode today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into how nutrients are
sourced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, the goal is for listeners to be
able to look at the back of their bottle
[SPEAKER_01]: and recognize some of the different
nutrients that are shown there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be confusing for some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be aware that some of the forms are
actually we should avoid because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually harmful to the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to go over that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Pro, you've been a sponsor of this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to thank you for doing that,
being able to provide this information to
[SPEAKER_01]: the general public that they can access
for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've sponsored that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both try to share as much knowledge as
we can, and it's a lot of hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give the platform to people actually
to go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy how many people hit me up and
be like, oh, I've seen you at Garden Talk
[SPEAKER_00]: with Mr. Grow-It or whenever my trade
shows, they mention your name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even had a situation a couple of months
ago where someone came up to me and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, can you let Chris know to do an
episode about this and this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I called you up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's a fan, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was so happy, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you as well for actually offering
that platform to a lot of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I listen to it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a fan of your show as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first thing we do on this podcast is
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, we go back to the 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't around then, I'm going to be
honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad, he started the Dutch Pro Nutrient
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a grower himself in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: Him and his business partner actually
started to look into nutrients to better
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow, how to make sure your plants
grow bigger, have better yields,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: That basically started late 70s,
early 80s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then at 85, they really got heavily into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then early 90s, that's when it came up
with the Dutch Pro Nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from that moment on, they just grew
out the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, when I come into play,
it's literally the moment I was born.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moment I was born, I grew up in
between plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad telling me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I must say, he never really pushed me
in any way to do something with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I just grew older and I saw more
and more and I read up about it myself
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more, I just thought it was so
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think plants are so undervalued by a lot
of people in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really decided to stick with it because
I was so excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things went automatic and normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pretty good size company here in
Europe, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our own factory and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I branched it out to the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I come into play really is
the US side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a cool journey, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really cool story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hop into the actual elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these elements, some of these
nutrients that are for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to be able to get through
all of them today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are 17 essential nutrients for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a few here that we're
going to go over that aren't actually an
[SPEAKER_01]: essential element, but are useful for
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get through as many as we can today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then maybe in the future, if the audience
demands it, we will get into a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go over more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it beneficial for the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe just do a quick run through of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe get into the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it's sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen, I think, is the most well-known
element as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty cool that we can actually
start off with that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what nitrogen does is it's like
one of the building blocks to create amino
[SPEAKER_00]: acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amino acids, in turn, is one of the
building blocks to create enzymes or
[SPEAKER_00]: proteins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes, proteins is the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enzymes are pretty cool because you need
them for nutrient transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They speed up the processes inside the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, without enzymes, a plant just
can't function.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it all starts with the building
block, which is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Furthermore, nitrogen is one of the
molecules that is needed to create the
[SPEAKER_00]: chlorophyll molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorophyll is needed to create the green
pigment, which actually is able to attract
[SPEAKER_00]: and use light energy for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen, I think, is a really cool
element.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, like I said, one of the more
well-known elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is also cool to know about nitrogen
inside the plant, it's a mobile element.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you guys that want to know,
like, hey, where do I find the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the older leaves, the one at the
bottom, because nitrogen is mobile,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it goes wherever it's needed the most,
which is, in this case, the younger
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the problem with nitrogen is it is a
very difficult element to attract from
[SPEAKER_00]: nature, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most of the time, actually,
to early 1900s, all nitrogen that was used
[SPEAKER_00]: by plants and to grow crops and everything
literally came through the nitrification
[SPEAKER_00]: from bacteria and fungi inside the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the discussions that I sometimes
have with people, and especially people
[SPEAKER_00]: that want to go back to the old days,
where they want to use bacteria and fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: to actually give organic nutrients to the
plant, which, by the way, guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not against organic nutrients,
not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, like I said, one of the discussions I
have is with the amount of people we have
[SPEAKER_00]: right now, and we're currently at 7.8
billion people, is it still doable,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, to feed the whole world if we
actually use the methods from back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: old days?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally give them examples,
Chris, and I don't know if you know that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but go back three, four hundred years in
time, it was not actually crazy to think
[SPEAKER_00]: of that sometimes 10 to 15 percent of a
population in Europe would literally die
[SPEAKER_00]: off because there wasn't enough food
around, because of a misharvest or because
[SPEAKER_00]: climate wasn't playing its part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yield-wise, there wasn't just
literally enough food, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed all the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is one of the things that whenever
I talk, you know, with people about
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nutrients, I always think about,
you know, tell them, like, think about,
[SPEAKER_00]: can we feed the whole world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were 7.8 billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is 5.8 billion more as back in the
1900s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, can we actually produce enough in an
organic way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, coming back to what you said,
the nitrogen cycle, because, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen is a difficult element to fix it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally, the nitrogen cycle goes,
you have plants that die off, decay,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got animals that, you know,
in this case, actually do the big thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you know what I mean, and the brown
part, I don't know if you want to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bacteria, fungi, I mean,
they start to work, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nitrogen actually, in all the plant
animal matter that's being left behind,
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually first turn it into ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from ammonia, it actually being
turned into ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ammonium is already one of the forms
that plants can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that moment on, it goes from
ammonium to nitrates and then to nitrate,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is again, another second form of
nitrate, nitrogen that can be used by
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in this case, like I said,
the Germans actually figured out a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up the process and to actually
fixate nitrogen so we could mass produce
[SPEAKER_00]: ammonium and nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again, are two directly available
forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes through the Haber-Bosch
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure a lot of people actually
already heard of it somehow, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: process basically goes as follows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, what you see in the air,
like literally like 80% of it is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen, yeah, like I said, nitrogen with
an N and then two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a part of it is oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of it is nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what's being done is air is
being withdrawn and then methane is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically being put into this chamber,
heated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we literally talk about crazy heat,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about 750 to 930 Fahrenheit,
where it is being brought together.
[SPEAKER_00]: A crazy amount of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we talk about like 100 bar,
which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically what is being done is
it goes through like four processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four different types of process where
methane, the air, heat, pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this case, also air actually being
put together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a catalyzer, and in this case,
they often use a catalyzer, which is iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually is able to bind the molecules
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is able to do bind the nitrogen with
the hydrogen molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you talk about ammonium,
which is the first directly available
[SPEAKER_00]: form, the molecular structure,
guys, is NH4, which is one nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: four hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you talk about nitrate,
which is the second available form,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's one nitrogen, it's an oxygen,
and then it's a negative ion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's negative three, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all starts first with ammonium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is it important that we first
start off with ammonium?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a second process involved
to create nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Chris, whenever you look at like a
bottle, right, of liquid nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you turn it around and you look at
like the sources, because companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, fertilizers, we do need to state
our sources, you often see when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to nitrogen, like a calcium nitrate,
magnesium nitrate, but also nitric acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you agree to that, right, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are like recognizable terms,
what I said, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are common, yeah, very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urea is another one, which is in this case
like a cheap form of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally one of the cheapest forms
you can get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also the one that is not the best
available to plants, to be honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's such an organic product and
it's easy to over-apply, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we can skip it a little bit,
that's also, because you were talking in
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning about bad forms,
right, of raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often what is the case, if you look at
like big egg, is the quality of fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you have to think, you know,
like those big agricultural farms that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow crop or soya or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they don't really get the most out
of their pricing, if you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're easily turned towards input
materials that are low quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the price needs to be low,
so it's often low quality materials as
[SPEAKER_00]: well that they use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, because they don't
really have such a good profit structure,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's difficult for them to implement
technology to really analyze what their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's easy for them to over-apply
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big problem which you see in the
Gulf of Mexico, and I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_00]: heard about it, Chris, is eutrophication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the over-application of
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get over-application and it
washes out of the fields, into the rivers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and eventually into the oceans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is that such a big problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, basically, and it's funny enough,
the problem is that algae, they grow so
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenally well when more nitrogen
actually, you know, ends up in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, the Gulf of Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not literally that it kills
because there's too much nitrogen and the
[SPEAKER_00]: algae in the plants, they just don't know
what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally that the algae just grow
way too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have here, at least,
I mean, I'm currently in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have here is those little side
canals, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very easy to just literally only
see green on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the algae's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what happens is that the
algae's block sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It blocks the sunlight for the plants
below the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those plants, those water plants,
they're crucial for creating oxygen inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the water, which in this case,
all animals need even on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when algae actually blocks getting
sunlight directly to the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath, eventually you literally turn
off the oxygen input into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's when all the animals,
all the fish, everything dies because
[SPEAKER_00]: there isn't enough oxygen in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eutrophication, in this case,
literally means you have too many algae
[SPEAKER_00]: growing from the over application of
fertilizers by big egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore not enough oxygen is being
left in the water anymore or produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the plants as well as animals
under the algae dies off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So personally, I love technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also indoors, Chris, if you
because I see a lot of grow facilities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow facilities and the technology
that some of those facilities put in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also reduces actually the over
application of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, going back actually to the sourcing
of how, in this case, nitrogen is fixated,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ammonium that we first talked is
actually used in the Oswald process to
[SPEAKER_00]: create nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nitric acid, guys, you often see it
with a pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You often see that companies use a form of
nitric acid to lower the pH in someone's
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically with the Oswald process,
it's kind of similar to the Haber Bosch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't use methane or anything like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they do use is the ammonium,
let it go to multiple processes of heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is eventually they start with a high
heat and they lower it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: They add water in there as well along the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing that, they create an
environment under pressure that the water
[SPEAKER_00]: and the ammonium actually bind together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that eventually at the end of the line
creates nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, important for you guys to know is the
filtration processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I mean with plants like factories
all over the world that produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: in this case, nitrogen with the Haber
Bosch process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically all the elements that we
use, no matter if it comes from like rock,
[SPEAKER_00]: air, animal plant matter, you know,
what people call organic, it's still all
[SPEAKER_00]: organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there is no 100% pure form of
anything on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even with these chemical sourcing,
as people would call it, there are still
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration processes that needs to be
involved to create purities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we move along, Chris, towards
phosphorus, for example, phosphorus is an
[SPEAKER_00]: element, guys, that is very easily able to
bind with heavy metals, heavy metal like
[SPEAKER_00]: iron, heavy metal like aluminum,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you use phosphorus that is
impure, for example, you already see that
[SPEAKER_00]: what you put in into your fertilizers is
not 100% available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we need to do,
Chris, as a fertilizer brand, if we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to be registered in the US, is we need to
test all our products for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the heavy metals, for example,
testing turns positive, or in this case,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a negative thing, of course,
because you hit a certain amount of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals, your fertilizers are not allowed
to be sold on the market because it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: danger to both plant as well as for human
consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the case of phosphorus,
you also reduce actually the quality of
[SPEAKER_00]: the material because it is not available
to the plant again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, like I said, let's just move on to
phosphorus, to be honest, Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think we've said everything
about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So transitioning over to phosphorus,
that's another thing really that
[SPEAKER_01]: contributes to these toxic algae blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same exact thing over fertilization,
runoff, into these lakes, ponds,
[SPEAKER_01]: toxic algae blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a big reason why a lot of people
don't use some of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of frowned upon to use some
of these in outdoor environments,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly for runoff into the lakes and
streams and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, let's get into phosphorus a
little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how is it beneficial to the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it sourced?
[SPEAKER_01]: What form does Dutch Pro use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think phosphorus is a really interesting
one because of the history as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, but if you look like sourcing,
it also evolved over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Often how people did it back in the days
and we come, especially potassium,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, is a very cool one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, let's start off with phosphorus
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you can see I'm very excited about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'm like, okay, straighten
up, Rico, just one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically phosphorus is a crucial
element in especially energy production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a quick note about what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got ADP, which stands for adenosine
diphosphate or dephosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ADP needs to be transformed to ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's adenosine triphosphate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the ADP, you got two phosphates
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the energy molecule ATP,
you got three molecules involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to apply phosphorus to your
plants in order to actually create these
[SPEAKER_00]: energy molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funny enough, all living animals and
plants, they use the same source of
[SPEAKER_00]: energy, ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing how efficient
sometimes literally the world can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so efficient, guys,
that literally we all use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all use the same form of energy,
which is called ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is happening with ATP is the bond
eventually is being broken up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happens, that's when the
energy is released to fulfill all the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that happens in both human as
well as animals as well as in plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, furthermore, phosphorus is also an
activator of enzymes and roots love it as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots grow really, really well under
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, multiple things like calcium as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Roots love calcium as well, guys,
but we come to it later.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I just think is
funny, Chris, when you look at fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: is the over application of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: People talk about the PK 1314 or they talk
about like 52, 34, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like more phosphorus for like
flower development and bud development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, it is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at nature and if you look
at the resources, and I show people that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like, wow, I didn't think that
that was the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I showed them is actually plants
don't need that much phosphorus as people
[SPEAKER_00]: really think that they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, they talk about nitrogen
that you shouldn't use in a flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, guys, I would say try
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try using a product that has no nitrogen
during flower and you will see yourself
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand why people want to cut it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear some people talk about don't
use any nitrogen at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, I guess no amino acid
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess chlorophyll production is going to
be down as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good luck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, phosphorus is often an over
applied element.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's easy to bind with
heavy metals in the substrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of what they apply, Chris,
literally just resides in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the substrate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a couple of ways that you
can use to increase efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like humiculphic acids, microbes,
but still over application of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_00]: is definitely a problem in the world,
both indoors as well as with big
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting if we go back to history,
actually, is that it was already
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered in the 1600s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I don't know why it has always
been by a German.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy how often we're going to see
the Germans involved in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was actually already discovered,
Chris, in 1669, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funny enough, you just mentioned urea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to deal with urine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally what happened is when you
actually distilled urine, a white salt was
[SPEAKER_00]: being left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first phosphorus,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very flammable, glowed in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever you see something glow in the
dark, like a bowling alley or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: they also use some form of phosphorus in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funny thing enough, I don't know,
do you know where the name comes from,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually means like Miraculous Bearer
of Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh, interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously I did my research before,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that I'm going to know it all
or anything like that, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: But funny enough, do you know how many
gallons actually of urine it took to
[SPEAKER_00]: create like 60 grams of phosphorus?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, how many gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: 290 gallons to produce 60 grams of
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of e-collection out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, obviously that wasn't a source
that we could use to use in any type of
[SPEAKER_00]: application, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funny enough, after that, the largest
source up until the end of the 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century was actually the bones and also
guano, you know, bones of animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because there's a lot of like
phosphate found inside bones and also in
[SPEAKER_00]: guano, you know, there was a good amount
of phosphates found as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So funny enough, the whole world turned
actually towards the bones because calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphates were found in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually, like I said,
you also know in guano itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at one point, because more and
more synthetic fertilizers were actually
[SPEAKER_00]: used and demanded for, especially towards
the end of the 19th century, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to find a different source because
literally at one point, everything was
[SPEAKER_00]: already basically used and it just
couldn't keep up with the demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons why synthetic
fertilizers were so popular at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the 19th century had to do with Justice
von Leibig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you talked about it,
Chris, before in a different episode with
[SPEAKER_00]: one of your other people, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of you that didn't see that
specific episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Justice von Leibig is basically a
German scientist, again, always a German,
[SPEAKER_00]: that discovered those 17 elements that a
plant needs to grow and develop
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the MPKs, the calcium, the solver,
the magnesium, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: And interestingly, that happened around
1850, 1860.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after that, that's really because he
finally discovered, hey, this is what we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do to actually grow really good
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a consistent way, that's when the
whole synthetic industry basically came to
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened, because like I
said, at one point, the demand actually
[SPEAKER_00]: over exceeded the supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when it turned to phosphate
rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you heard about that,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, rock phosphate is used very
commonly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a number one source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I shouldn't say there isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some really big companies
working on a different source of
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still an experimental phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because they
literally think that with the demand that
[SPEAKER_00]: we currently have, that the world is going
to run out of phosphorus in like 40 to 50
[SPEAKER_00]: years, which is going to be a problem,
especially if at that time we're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be with 9 to 10 billion people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all need to be fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all hungry multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphorus is honestly crucial in that
supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, rock phosphates indeed is where
the majority of the phosphorus comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what happens with those rock
phosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know what an electric
arc is, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically like a big furnace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also like how to make steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And steel is also being made by extreme
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And an electric arc, you can see it as
like you've got like three of these pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got like three of these pins.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they all actually like electricity
goes through it and they basically connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other through electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because by doing so, an extreme heat
is basically produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when phosphate rocks actually are
being put in there and they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed with, in this case, a product,
it's called coke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the coke that comes from
Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, guys, but it's a natural
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually mixes with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then element of phosphorus is actually
created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And element of phosphorus is like a pure
form of phosphorus that can be actually
[SPEAKER_00]: further amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, what I do actually is
they distill it and then actually they
[SPEAKER_00]: burn it with air to produce phosphorus
pentoxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the phosphorus pentoxide,
in this case, is being dissolved in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that creates phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And phosphoric acid is another frequently
used form in fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is also used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually we use phosphoric acid in our
pH minus bloom version because we got two
[SPEAKER_00]: different bloom versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know all about it because you got the
bottles at home, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphoric acid very commonly used in pH
down products and often says that it kills
[SPEAKER_01]: off microbes, which is a myth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people think that they're
adjusting the pH using pH up or pH down
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's wiping out the whole micro
population, which is false.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the common myths that you
hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's crazy to hear how many myths
there are and also like how many myths are
[SPEAKER_00]: spread by some really big companies in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And often what kills like the microbes is
literally the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when it's too low, basically
everything below pH four, guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is when most bacteria can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't grow in that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you use phosphoric acid on its
own and you mix it with water and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, the pH would never get below
pH four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just like you said, it doesn't kill
anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also one of the reasons why
fertilizers, liquid fertilizers often have
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty low pH on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has to do actually with the
longevity of the product to keep it in
[SPEAKER_00]: good condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the last things that we
want when you sell your fertilizers is the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria can grow inside a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally the bottle of nutrients is
like a bottle of like a positive poison
[SPEAKER_00]: that plants want to use to grow big and
heavy and you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you just look at places,
for example, like Chernobyl, life wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow every single way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, one of the things we have
to do as far as liquid fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like manufacturers, we need to
keep the pH low to keep the microbes out
[SPEAKER_00]: initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's like a little bit of a side
note.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we use, because that is also like one
of the questions I think you want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, like what does Detzper use?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use a mixture actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use like indeed phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use something called mono
potassium, mono potassium phosphorus as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it honestly has to do with like
creating the right mixtures, the right
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios for some of the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We personally only use the minimum of a
food grade product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always first look at like the heavy
metal analysis of, you know, the supplies
[SPEAKER_00]: that we get in because we only want to
ensure that what we sell to you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's also like the highest quality that we
can offer and still offer the best price
[SPEAKER_00]: quality ratio because that is also
important, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's personally what we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lots of information about these
elements more than I expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm just excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great information for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go into potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So similar to the other elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how is it beneficial to the
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it sourced?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of what form does Dutch Pro
use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there any forms that we should
avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a couple of good questions,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing, one side note.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why I'm so excited about it, Chris,
I was in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of weeks ago and I was actually
with a friend of mine who grows and we got
[SPEAKER_00]: in the store and obviously there are so
many brands to choose from.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Rico, he's like, to be honest,
he's like, I don't understand nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I look at the bottle,
I look at the bag, I see all those,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it actually being sourced?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had to think about this
podcast, obviously, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I really want to, you know,
make sure that I tell like the full
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, full story that definitely double
triggered me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potassium is crucial in both veg as
well as flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is actually the only element that
is not part of an organelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what it does is it is
crucial for nutrients transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is also crucial for the regulation
of CO2 through the stomata, through the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's something called like a
potassium pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to go too deep into it
right now because it's about sourcing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically what you have to realize and
understand about potassium is it literally
[SPEAKER_00]: regulates the inflow and outflow of
elements from cell A to B, or at least
[SPEAKER_00]: plays a crucial part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium also activates enzymes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, enzymes are used also for
nutrient transportation, but also to speed
[SPEAKER_00]: up a variety of processes inside a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and like I said, potassium is just
crucial both during veg as well as flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name, I think, is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium, which is obviously a Latin
name, but it's also frequently called
[SPEAKER_00]: potash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically with potash, how it really
started is just by burning wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and the ash literally that was
being left behind, placed it in a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potassium is very water soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's one of the most water soluble
elements actually in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically by mixing it with water and
then filtering it, you get like the
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium that's being left behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And initially, actually, it wasn't even
used as a fertilizer, funny enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was eventually used as a fertilizer
because they had so much of it and they
[SPEAKER_00]: had no clue what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like, you know what,
let's just use it as a fertilizer and see
[SPEAKER_00]: what happens as an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But up in that point, it was actually used
for soap production mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, potassium was actually used as like
a soap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what they would do to make
soap back in the days was use like fat
[SPEAKER_00]: from like a pig or whatever, and then
actually mix it with water and then
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you mix it up, that's literally how
they created the first soaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And funny enough, a lot of the trees and
forests that were cut down in Europe back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the days was actually to create
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something very cool, I think,
is the first U .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: patent in history was actually because of
potassium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually an improvement of how to
filter potassium to offer a more cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: source of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: First patent ever in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: history was about potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go actually back to the 18th
century and it was signed by George
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was pretty cool as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, a lot of like trees were cut
down actually because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was literally like one of the
biggest sources up until like the 19th
[SPEAKER_00]: century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 19th century actually,
like I said, so many trees were cut down,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the forests were cut down in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then forests were cut down in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well because of potassium production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened then is they found
potassium really deep into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was literally an average that would
find it like over 4000 feet deep,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is obviously crazy deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also brought a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Risks with them to actually mine the
potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accidents would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't uncommon, you know, that like
gas and oil was actually sitting pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: close at that depth as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some accidents happened with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually what they did, and I
thought it's so simple, Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it is so smart and still works so well
that it's still being used up till today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They used the water solubility in their
advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you guys Google, there's an amazing
video out there on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about potassium mining in Utah,
like two hours southeast from Salt Lake
[SPEAKER_00]: City.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally what they do is they drill a
hole to the source of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pour water in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally, you know, give potassium
time to dissolve in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just pump it out at the other side
through a different hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they literally create these lakes,
which they treat with a mixture of copper
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate to actually keep the bacteria and
fungi away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they literally just wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: They let it evape.
[SPEAKER_00]: They literally let the water evape out of
those lakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is being left behind is just a
thick layer of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is literally how most of the
potassium nowadays is still sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an efficient way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's so easy, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, Chris, it's a very interesting
video as well to watch for everyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: your audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see those lakes and those lakes,
actually, they change the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water changes color because of the
copper sulfates and because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: different evaporation stages that they are
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the potassium, you know,
after the potassium is sourced,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is easy to bind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the binding when it comes to
fertilizers, it is being done through a
[SPEAKER_00]: mixture of pressure and heat and a
catalyzer, you know, like an iron,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, or another metal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is literally the basic what you need
to understand of how elements are attached
[SPEAKER_00]: to each other, like a potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, like when you look at the
back of a bottle, you see potassium
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfate or you see monopotassium
phosphate, for example, or you see calcium
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, those elements,
I mean, they need to be binded together
[SPEAKER_00]: through some form of process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that often goes through heat,
pressure, and catalyzation as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we use a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use, for example, potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use monopotassium phosphates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we use a couple of varieties of
potassium as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any forms that we should avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are a couple of forms that you should
avoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yes and no, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all has to do, again, with the
filtration process.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that you can't see from
a label, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also a little bit the strong
point, obviously, of the brands,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like the raw materials that they
use, the quality of the raw materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all has to do with filtration
processes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How clean is the raw material that you
use?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you guys can totally do,
and you can definitely do with us,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can literally ask for the heavy metal
analysis, if you guys want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see how clean our nutrients
are, go over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, send me a text.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for you, say, Instagram or,
you know, go to our website, contact us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we also already have it out on
the website as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys can just look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we should, as nutrients
manufacturers and brands, we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: open and transparent towards the people
about what's inside the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you on that one,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is one of the ones where I feel
like not many people talk about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's right up there with the
importance of NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to us about sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it beneficial for the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: How is it sourced?
[SPEAKER_01]: What form does Dutch Pro use?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sulfur is actually a funny one in a
variety of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, it's an important
element because it's one of the building
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks for two crucial amino acids,
which is methionine and cysteine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they are both crucial actually for the
transportation of electrons, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: then actually used to create the energy
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically without sulfur, honestly,
you would know that straight away with
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies when your leaves turn
basically white, yellow white.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would definitely see that your
growth is stagnated in your overall flower
[SPEAKER_00]: development.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, funny enough, and I never realized it
actually up until I did some deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you remember those videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: You basically saw them back in the days
where you saw people wearing cotton cloths
[SPEAKER_00]: and you saw all these gases around them
and it was like a yellow mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was on the outside these old
gases.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like the old sulfur mines,
actually, and it's super poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you still sometimes actually see it,
you know, in like very poor countries
[SPEAKER_00]: because sulfur definitely brings in some
money, but it's so poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look up like, you know,
sulfur mines, poor countries or
[SPEAKER_00]: underdeveloped countries, you know,
give it a term, you would definitely find
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was also like how that back in
the days would source it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was not a sustainable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not actually a way that would work
long term wise because of the health of
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically how they then did it was they
used a different process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the fresh process,
actually, which is what they would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they would use the solubility of
sulfur itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they would find sulfur mines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would actually put hot water in
there, hot enough so the sulfur would
[SPEAKER_00]: actually melt and mix in the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once brought to the surface,
actually, they would literally have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: 99.5% efficiency ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 99.5% of the sulfur deep in the mines,
they would get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, this process was very
costly to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they turned away to a different source
and that source is still used up till
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, funny enough, sulfur right
now, it is a byproduct from the petroleum
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it literally is a byproduct from the
petroleum industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had a couple of advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, less risk was involved as
far as health concerns, but it was also
[SPEAKER_00]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what happens is the
byproduct is called hydrogen sulfide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hydrogen sulfide actually goes through
a process called Klaus, the Klaus process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this process actually is already
pretty old.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back to like late 1800s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what happened, and it's just
similar to the different processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: it would go through like distillation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go through multiple distillation
processes where heat, again, was involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures, like I said, heat was
involved, pressure was involved,
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyzation was involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when nitrogen needs like a temperature
of like 800 Fahrenheit, we talk about 1900
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during wintertime, guys, whenever
you're cold, just stay close to a sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: furnace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I actually would get when they
would treat it with this heat is they
[SPEAKER_00]: would get elemental sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, elemental sulfur is a pure form
that they could build on to eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: create sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's, by the way, what we're
going to end up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to end up with sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the elemental sulfur, in this
case, it would go through a different
[SPEAKER_00]: process called the contact process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what that would do is the
sulfur is burned to sulfur dioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sulfur dioxide is again being
turned into sulfur trioxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, heat is involved, pressure is
involved, catalyzation is involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sulfur trioxide eventually is
being mixed with water or added with water
[SPEAKER_00]: to create sulfuric acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this sulfuric acid actually is already
a source of sulfur, obviously,
[SPEAKER_00]: on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you often fight sulfur as a
combination of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, you have copper sulfates.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got potassium sulfates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salts is actually magnesium
sulfates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfur sulfates is often a product that is
combined and mixed already with another
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sulfuric acid is crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crucial in different processes to
bind with, for example, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: to bind with, for example, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is literally, in this case,
all there is to say, Chris, about sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use, in this case, not sulfuric acid on
its own, but we use combination products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, like a copper sulfate,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything in a combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Epsom salts and everything as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all comes down to how clean is the
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's such a big variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think that the choice for picking
your nutrients in the store is already
[SPEAKER_00]: big, just wait till you go to the back end
of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of raw materials that you can
choose from is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's difficult to explain and to
show people because it's obviously also
[SPEAKER_00]: like we don't want to make our competition
smarter already than they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also our secret recipe, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you have to look at how clean is
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well is it filtered?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also what is important to us,
at least, is the processes that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because definitely what you see is a lot
of sources actually come from low cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Places as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we don't deal
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to deal with low cost
countries because they're often also like
[SPEAKER_00]: safe on quality measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also often save on healthy measures
or even have like kids involved or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that we don't want to
be associated with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only actually do business with
companies that we actually align with as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that definitely makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely covered not really much
when the Korean scheme of things we
[SPEAKER_01]: covered nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
we did sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to get more done, but there's
just there's so much we're definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have to do a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I do want to comment on is that
I really like and it's real apparent that
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys are focused on the science behind
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I learned quite a bit in this
episode, but there are some things I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: currently attending Utah State University.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a horticulture certification I'm
going through right now by Dr. Bruce
[SPEAKER_01]: Bugby.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's well known in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of things that you're saying in
this episode, he's saying, so I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going by the science when it comes
to these elements, you know, sourcing,
[SPEAKER_01]: avoiding some of the things that you
should avoid because it's bad for the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, we definitely have to do a
part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, next episode, I think silicon,
calcium, magnesium, boron, copper,
[SPEAKER_01]: iron, we can go on and on and even
chlorine is something that's worth talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's do a part two here with the next
couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is one that people are going
to want to hear about wrapping things up
[SPEAKER_01]: on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there are a couple of ways
actually to find us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can go to our website,
That's for USA.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of information, videos are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go to our Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally pretty active out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, we go in and out of a
shadow band, you know, at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we probably have to put in That's for
USA completely in order to find us at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are starting our own YouTube channel
pretty soon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we have a pretty cool idea as
far as podcasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we can actually do it the
other way around, too, Chris, and have you
[SPEAKER_00]: on our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think that could be pretty
cool.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as like for the future,
a lot of cool things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some really interesting things as
far as product development.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to focus heavily on spreading
and sharing knowledge, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: with you guys as much as we can,
because we literally want to help out as
[SPEAKER_00]: many growers as we can become better
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learn every single day from amazing
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love to help other people as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the whole team is motivated to
help other people as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have your channel and
Instagram and website all linked down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the description section below on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot to discuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be like a Harry Potter
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have your links down in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coupon code as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone's interested in purchasing Dutch
Pro products, use the coupon code
[SPEAKER_01]: MRGROWIT10DP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Works on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I believe it works on your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct me if I'm wrong there,
but it should work on your website as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use them in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants looking great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for coming on to this
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you guys.
