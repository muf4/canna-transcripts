[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, for those of you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 143.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Zaza from
Zaza Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the podcast once before back in
2021, episode number 31, where he talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about breeding on an intermediate level.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, we're going to continue
the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole bunch of good breeding
questions for him this time around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some were submitted by viewers like
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about herms, back-crossing,
breeding autoflowers, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a channel where I show the
plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that being said, I'd like to thank
the sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back, and I'm joined with Zaza
from Zaza Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, brother?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming back onto the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is your second time on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time was on episode 31, September
12th, 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: So several years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that one has over 52,000 views on
YouTube alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's got, I don't know,
another 10,000 plus on audio platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it did really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about intermediate plant
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue that conversation
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I mentioned intermediate,
there are going to be some beginner things
[SPEAKER_00]: in here as well, I'm sure we'll touch
upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't want to scare away any of the
beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll definitely be able to grasp onto
some things here that we talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those folks that didn't catch the first
[SPEAKER_00]: episode we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Salam, Salam Sims, better known
as Zaza, owner of Zaza Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a breeder for many years,
started out with animals many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many years ago, and eventually
transitioned into plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New Jersey is where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so happy to be here once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Short and sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I highly recommend after this episode,
you guys seek out the first episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have that linked in the
description.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let's continue on the
conversation here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, you hear the word
hermaphrodite a lot or herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody in the comment section said
that's an offensive word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that actually offensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should it just be intersex traits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we changing things or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermaphroditism is a scientific term.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we think in terms of the
vocabulary and language, it's super
[SPEAKER_01]: important, especially being able to tie
those certain words to other words and
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions and actually being able to get
that hands-on experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to practice with the actual
scientific word as close as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I recommend hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: No need to change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want to get a little bit deeper
on what a hermaphrodite is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of different ones,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a female plant that shows pollen
sacs, and then there's a female plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: shows nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain the differences between
the two?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a natural herm, which is genetically
coded, it's there in a natural state.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The code, per se, cannot be removed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be bred to a recessive state where
it doesn't expose itself through selective
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a natural herm shows its
characteristics by the actual sac that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're familiar with, the ball sac.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen sac stores and collects pollen,
and then its objective is to, once it's
[SPEAKER_01]: full, open up and release pollen to
pollinate any female within three-mile
[SPEAKER_01]: radius or whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ultimately, it has a certain look,
the balls, which are separate from the
[SPEAKER_01]: female parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't see them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see female parts in one place and
balls on another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll have the agenda to basically
pollinate a female using that pollen sac.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of that pollen sac are stamen,
stamen which we know as nanners.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, nanners on the other
hermaphrodite, which we tend to refer to
[SPEAKER_01]: as stress-induced.
[SPEAKER_01]: A stress-induced hermaphrodite will show
nanners or expose nanners.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically, its agenda is much
different because it's hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't necessarily want to be out and
about and show everybody what it has going
[SPEAKER_01]: on, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the male pollen sac wants to just
open up right there out and about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is more hidden because the agenda and
the reason why she's pollinating herself
[SPEAKER_01]: using these stamen is because she feels
stressed enough to feel like she needs to
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce and possibly preserve her
genetics in case of an emergency
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you actually have a video on your
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title is, Why Your Plants Should Never
Herm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you answer that question here for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's a sign of weakness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we know as an undesirable trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any undesirable traits should be removed
through selective breeding by the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't ever want to release a product
or put a product out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shows any undesirable traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to the dog world, if you're buying
or selling a puppy, you don't want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive litter of puppies and you just
sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a super undesirable trait and that
needs to be removed before anybody else
[SPEAKER_01]: can be in contact with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing with herms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a breeder, are they able to,
quote, breed out the hermaphrodite trait
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it just go from a dominant to a
recessive trait and it will stay as a
[SPEAKER_00]: recessive and there's no way of actually
breeding it out, getting it out of there
[SPEAKER_00]: completely?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the case for the natural herm
where, like I said, genetically,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still going to maintain its coding
within the gene pool, but you can breed it
[SPEAKER_01]: to recessive where it doesn't expose
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nanners, on the other hand, they will be
able to be made recessive because it's due
[SPEAKER_01]: to weakness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more so closely related to Darwin's
theory of evolution in natural selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think in terms of only the strong
survive, all weakness can be removed and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not coded.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what we know as an inheritable trait,
weakness or stamen or nanners,
[SPEAKER_01]: inheritable trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be removed completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the things to keep in mind is
when the plant gets all the way towards
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and you push it even further,
it could show nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you still consider those weakness or
all plants are going to pop out nanners at
[SPEAKER_00]: the very, very end if you push it too far,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's still the same mechanism of
stress that wants to say, hey man,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm way past harvest time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something needs to happen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still a sign of weakness.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a sign of stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant will probably, it's safe to say
that most plants will exhibit nanners if
[SPEAKER_01]: you put it past a certain, but some to the
point where you could actually identify
[SPEAKER_01]: them and see a whole bunch, some where it
might just be one manner throughout the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant because it's that strong
enough to resist based on you constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting for only the strongest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stress testing is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all directly related to stress
testing and only the strong survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're actually going to be
getting into stress test on a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We invited Zaza onto the from the stash
podcast and we have a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we revealed that hot topic
to you yet or not, but it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: some long lines of grower error or breeder
error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a fine line there
because sure plants should never harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does harm, it potentially falls on
the breeders for not doing that stress
[SPEAKER_00]: test as they should before releasing it to
the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what if it's a grower error,
such as they're just blasting with too,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much light, like too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously they just, they're, they're
doing something wrong within the growth
[SPEAKER_00]: too high of temps or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're stressing out beyond
naturally stressing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll hold off on any comments on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be, that's a whole episode
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a really,
really good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was ready to go right at it,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you stopped me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tune into from the stash podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's with me, Rob from CLT and pigeons
for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be a whole separate
conversation, which I'm looking forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: the last question I'll have on herms
before we move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a question from an Instagram user.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually reached out, posted an
Instagram story and asked folks if they
[SPEAKER_00]: had questions for breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a question they want to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are there so many intersex plants
popping up more often across multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's multiple breeders popping
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they don't, a lot of,
a lot of guys who consider themselves or
[SPEAKER_01]: call themselves breeders don't really
grasp the concept of what a breeder truly
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, they think it's just as simple as
one plus one and it makes two and you sell
[SPEAKER_01]: two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, when you got a ton of
people doing that, you're going to end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a ton of undesirable traits
throughout the, all of these different
[SPEAKER_01]: gene pools, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everybody's a breeder
nowadays, you know, and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: inexperienced people and they think that
Jesus needed to take pollen for one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it onto a female plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything's gravy from there,
which is far, far from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's, that could be very reason
why a lot of these breeders are having
[SPEAKER_00]: intersex plants because they're just not
doing it properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into another one of your video
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking through your channel,
by the way, Zaza had a great channel
[SPEAKER_00]: that's dedicated to breeding and I'll have
them linked down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can easily get to his channel,
but lots of great, great breeding topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is stabilization versus
uniformity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: The term that we hear often, um,
stabilize the, or this, this, this strain
[SPEAKER_01]: is stable or, you know, um, and I think
it's thrown around very loosely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when we think in terms of,
uh, stabilization, stabilization happens
[SPEAKER_01]: per gene, uh, per gene and trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you stabilize and isolate genes in
traits, uh, one at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's many times it's given,
give and take.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to, uh, be, be very,
very mindful about how you select,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, ultimately, um, that is overall
understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if someone's like, yeah, my strain is
stable and they're really just referring
[SPEAKER_00]: to uniformity of cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be complete homozygosity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke about homozygosity and
heterozygosity in the first episode we did
[SPEAKER_01]: originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of the introduction for
a lot of people to, to those terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homozygosity being complete uniformity,
uh, versus when you hear someone say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, uh, that strain is stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what they're really referring to
would, would have to be that that strain
[SPEAKER_01]: is completely uniform, meaning that each
allele for every gene is identical for mom
[SPEAKER_01]: and dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mom and dad each offer you two versions
of a trait or, uh, you know, and those
[SPEAKER_01]: versions can either be different or they
can be identical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if dad is offering you a copy of blue
eyes and a copy of brown eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be considered heterozygous.
[SPEAKER_01]: If mom is offering you a copy of blue eyes
and then another copy blue eyes,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's homo, homozygous
completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and if we have every gene in every
allele within the population, identical on
[SPEAKER_01]: both sides, mom and dad, that is complete
uniformity, but you can just imagine the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even to get to the beginning,
you're going to need a start point of
[SPEAKER_01]: about 20 years of selective breeding just
to be, okay, now we can work towards
[SPEAKER_01]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a trait can be stabilized within a year
to sometimes, you know, depends on what
[SPEAKER_01]: your objective is talking about traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people know what they're
looking for when it comes to females,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be phenol hunting, and then
using that for breeding or what,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so many different things you can
look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, that's, I think another thing we
talked about in the first episode,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when it comes to males, I think
there's a lot of confusion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what traits should people be
looking for when they're cultivating males
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and selecting for breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us some examples of things
you can look for in regards to traits for
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, first one, um, that is most important
is vigor athleticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you want, uh, the most vigorous of
the, um, population, uh, to start with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, then you can look at flower,
um, production and, uh, terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do stem and leaf rubs in order to
see if you can get a little terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but ultimately, uh, I think Khalifa,
uh, genetics, my brother Aladdin over at
[SPEAKER_01]: Khalifa Genetics said it best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, he said, it's really similar to you,
uh, trying to determine a daughter's,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, bra size by looking at her dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, I don't know, you know,
cause we, we, we only want the female,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, how, how do we ultimately make a
good decision on a true breeder male when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to, um, selecting and ultimately
I would suggest taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a video on, on picking males too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so for more in depth, the
explanation, you can go back and look
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but, uh, yeah, terpenes,
um, vigor and athleticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, I mean, as long as you got
that, you can, you can wrap, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the cluster of flowers on a male
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is something that's valuable to
look at and also structure as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: All good, all good, um, things to look for
after you find the most vigorous plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and then you can ultimately make
the best decision of what you think the
[SPEAKER_01]: female may come out to be, but clone,
clone, clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be your ultimate key to
going back in time, you know, whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: clone and document, clone and document.
[SPEAKER_01]: I clone everything and I document
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This clone, I like it because it is,
I don't like it because it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm keeping it for this reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then we do that in stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is early veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is middle veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is late veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is early flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, we can keep track of
everything and go back with our
[SPEAKER_01]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the stem rub technique for male
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some people against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that the smell is going to be
different when they do a step around and
[SPEAKER_00]: veg versus flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, do you feel the stem rub
technique is something that, no,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do it, I do it, um, a little bit
towards like mid veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to see, not necessarily because
that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, typically that aroma profile does
change once you and flower the actual
[SPEAKER_01]: buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be the same as the
greenery that you're rubbing on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the kick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I get a nice boom, you know,
hit me in the face and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so you're not necessarily looking for
identical aroma, but more so, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: effect of how, how, you know, like,
oh, that's potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, you know, that's,
that's fire, you know, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's, that's kind of what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily the exact aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that a lot of people go
after, uh, I've gotten male plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: had some purpling on the pollen sacks,
which that was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always talk to myself, I'm like,
Hmm, if I just like this over some pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: sacks that are all, you know, all green,
for example, does that give me a better
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to have some color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or does that come out in the offspring?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, when we think in terms of
backcrossing, it's so many different,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's, that's, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Backcrossing is a, is a, is a topic within
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, it's, it's another,
uh, tool that's very loosely, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown around, uh, and people have,
uh, little to no knowledge when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to backcrossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, most, most people's
understanding is you take a mother to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a single backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a simple, single backcrossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has its own purposes, but then you have
a, a trans, a more, more, uh, more in
[SPEAKER_01]: depth backcross, uh, where it's,
it's recurrent where, um, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: continuously back crossing through five or
six times in order to receive a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of the recurrent parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a recurrent parent and a donor
parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the donor parent is there strictly to
offer you a particular gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so their gene is going to be fixed
into your elite line versus you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: and this is where having knowledge,
uh, gives you confidence because,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in many cases you would take your
elite line, whatever it is you're working.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say, um, it is missing one
particular thing like, uh, more
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, but other than that is top
notch perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you would be willing to take the most,
uh, crappiest of plant as long as it has
[SPEAKER_01]: the proper gene for more resistance and do
an outcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you make that initial outcross,
you end up 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 50-50, you're going to select based
on that gene that you're tracking down,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, which is more resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go back to the recurrent parent on a
backcross that then makes a new population
[SPEAKER_01]: of 25-75.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means 75% identical to the recurrent
parent, 25% to what we know as the donor
[SPEAKER_01]: parent because we only need one thing from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as we continue, the further we
continue to backcross to the recurrent
[SPEAKER_01]: parent, we push out the genes for the
donor parent until eventually end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: about 98.6% at about six, six times,
if I'm, my math might be wrong,
[SPEAKER_01]: but about 98.6% identical to the recurrent
parent, but, um, only maintaining one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, which we selected for, which is
that more resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything else, the, the, the not
frosty, the run, all of that stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: pushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a, uh, that's a real
backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: A single backcross is a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give you the ability to take
a gene from one parent and, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce it into the background of
another parent, but it's 50-50 still.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you still have 50% of the genes from
the donor and 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a much faster,
um, result, but a lot of work that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be done behind it versus a recurrent
backcross, which you can, instead of just
[SPEAKER_01]: introducing a new gene, you're fixing the
gene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have third, third backcross,
which I'll mention real quick and I won't
[SPEAKER_01]: keep rambling on, but, um, it's a test
tree, a test cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a test cross is basically,
uh, um, using a backcross as a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify a certain gene that may be
dominant and determine, um, whether that
[SPEAKER_01]: gene is dominant or recessive and end up
with the correct ratio, uh, by,
[SPEAKER_01]: by backcrossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we end up with a one to one,
then we know it's a heterozygous dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we end up with a completely,
um, all the same dominant of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring, then we know it's homozygous
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a test cross, which is also a
backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you research on backcrosses everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took my guys who have a really strong,
I mean, three years in just the basics,
[SPEAKER_01]: it took them about four days to really
grasp the concept of backcrossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you got into backcrossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was literally my next question for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't even get a list of the
questions this time around, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're freestyling it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's funny that you got into
backcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what's a reverse backcross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: A reverse backcross that I'm not
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm growing a gelato 41,
a reverse backcross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wasn't entirely sure what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it may be a certain
mechanism that was done before the
[SPEAKER_01]: backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, it reversed the plant and then
backcrossed something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just adding in compound,
but that's technically not a type of
[SPEAKER_01]: backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a test cross or recurrent
backcrossing and a single backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the actual backcrosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, um, yeah, it was labeled as RBX.
[SPEAKER_01]: RBX.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reversed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a reverse program of reversal,
uh, done first and then a backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's fine as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just a compound of mechanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people get really confused as well
is that all of these different mechanics,
[SPEAKER_01]: S ones backcrosses or reverse backcrosses
or whatever it may be, or just tools
[SPEAKER_01]: within your toolbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, F one, F two, F three, every time you
make a move, you end up with a new
[SPEAKER_01]: population.
[SPEAKER_01]: That population has a new purpose for your
ultimate goal later down the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see people selling,
uh, this backcross or that backcross,
[SPEAKER_01]: ask some educated questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what type of backcross was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was the purpose of that backcross?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, from my understanding, their donor
parent and recurrent parent are used to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce a particular trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which trait were you using and why are you
selling it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know why you're selling it
because it's super important for you and
[SPEAKER_01]: your ultimate goal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you, your ultimate goal, maybe 20,
30 years from now is to be complete
[SPEAKER_01]: uniform, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Complete uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to make the perfect strength for
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, uh, you, you can only do that by
preserving all of your popular,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have dead ops OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, Mr. Growett was the only person that
ever, ever touch a S one, um, many years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, three, you know, I think you could,
and that was only because I knew,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you didn't like, uh, you know,
you would go test your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make sure it was female.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, so I went into one of my population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, all right, well I'm, you know,
give me the S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, that way you don't have to
test them, but probably got about 20
[SPEAKER_01]: something, 20, I don't know for sure,
but about 20 over 20 different
[SPEAKER_01]: populations, just for dead ops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So different F series, different back
crosses, different, and they all have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have to be documented and we all
have to, uh, keep track of them so that 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years from now, I don't know what I have
to go back and use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, boom, I got this from,
10 years ago, this back cross that I did
[SPEAKER_01]: to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is exactly what I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm still working dead ops 10,
15 years from now, but now I'm even closer
[SPEAKER_01]: to uniformity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, so it's just those tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't sell your tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell your F one, F two, F,
you know, F one is, is, is where you are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be introduced to, um,
hybrid vigor and heterosis, your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your potential of, of, and that's a
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one in a million.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a treasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you're looking for a treasure chest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't, you don't want to sell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to dig and search and hunt for
that, um, hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can find it, um, man,
you got, you got, you got, you got a gym
[SPEAKER_01]: and then F two is different because now
that's the only way you're going to expose
[SPEAKER_01]: your recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my only chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only shot I got to expose the
recessive traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go back in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can go back in ancestry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see great, great, great,
great granddad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how he used to walk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see all of these different,
uh, just by going back in history,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, and, and we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, all of those different mechanisms,
the S ones, the F ones, all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: different things are just different tools
in your toolbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, each one has its own purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, document that purpose, make it
important to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it becomes important to you,
you would never want to sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to understand your objective and
what you, which direction you want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go left?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go up?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go down?
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know that before you move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, when you have purpose like that,
you ain't going to sell, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't sell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give maybe a couple to you,
you know, but I can't sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever you see me selling these packs
of dead ops, it's, um, stuff that I called
[SPEAKER_01]: out of my population.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and this is the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get your gene pool to a certain
strength, that's why stress testing is the
[SPEAKER_01]: most important strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stress and athleticism is most important
vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it to a certain point,
um, then you can be confident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confident enough to know that you
won't have any undesirables that other
[SPEAKER_01]: people will complain about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can give you my throwaways,
but you won't complain about them because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to harm on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be stunted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still, you know, it's,
it's just that I don't, for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, I'm selecting toward a certain
direction and I have a certain objective
[SPEAKER_01]: and I need to accomplish that by removing
anything that's not within that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, which doesn't, you know, fit within
that criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring it back to back cross for
a minute here in breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're working an inbred line,
from my understanding, you get to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where you should actually back cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I don't know if it's like an F five
or an F six, but if you go, if you
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to go down the line, apparently
you come across like weird characteristics
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to avoid that, you would back
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, when you continuously go through
the Mendelian road to inheritance through,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, F one, F two, F three, F four,
uh, eventually you do lose that was most
[SPEAKER_01]: important to us vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I always stress bigger,
bigger, bigger, because it's the alpha to
[SPEAKER_01]: your omega.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you continuously going down,
down, down, you're losing all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: vigor in athleticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the only way to, uh, uh,
repair that is to back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now a single back cross, um, can be
somewhat effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it can be somewhat effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on how much inbreeding
depression you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a severe case of inbreeding
depression, then a single back cross won't
[SPEAKER_01]: suffice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll need to continuously, um,
but still it's going to be a recurrent
[SPEAKER_01]: back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just going to be a different type
of back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, you know, but, uh,
just, uh, for, for a smaller, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: less dramatic case of inbreeding
depression, then, um, you could just do a
[SPEAKER_01]: single go back to, um, the right parent
vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you always start with vigor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, you have the freedom to move
about when you know, you have a strong
[SPEAKER_01]: foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another question from a person on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, does a photo period need
to be brought to F four and or stabilize
[SPEAKER_00]: before breeding it into an auto flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, we'll stay, we'll stay and I'll be
able to answer that by staying on the
[SPEAKER_01]: topic of back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if I was to create an auto flower,
I would do it through a series of
[SPEAKER_01]: recurrent back crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is the method I would do my first
initial outcross with a photo period and
[SPEAKER_01]: an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, end up with 50 50 half half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would select the best auto flower
from the new population to back cross to
[SPEAKER_01]: the photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, like I said, we'll,
we'll end up if we go to five,
[SPEAKER_01]: six, seven times back cross, we'll end up
with 98.9% identical to our photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now the auto flower gene should now be
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, is that the auto flower
gene itself is much more complex than just
[SPEAKER_01]: the photo period gene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the auto flower gene is, and I don't
want to get too complicated, but we
[SPEAKER_01]: understand medallion inheritance to be F1,
F2, F3 Mendel, uh, uh, Gregor,
[SPEAKER_01]: Gregor Mendel and his F1, F2, F3,
F4, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 1865.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long time ago from what he taught
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others have then started to, you know,
understand different methods in ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there's non medallion,
um, inheritances as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we think in terms of Mendel,
uh, laws, we think of dominant and
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think in terms of non Mendelian
laws or inheritances, we, we thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: about incomplete dominance, uh,
over dominance, pseudo dominance thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and auto flower is an example of
incomplete dominance, meaning that two
[SPEAKER_01]: genes are expressing themselves at the
same time in, um, a way where neither one
[SPEAKER_01]: is fully committing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's incomplete versus, uh,
a photo period, which is a complete,
[SPEAKER_01]: completely dominant tree, uh, within,
within a photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's just the complexity of the
auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to answer your question, um,
a backcross would be the way to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if you wanted to cross or create your
own auto flower, a recurrent backcross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, once you get to about 90
something percent, you'll need to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: series of selfs, uh, probably you need to,
do some self pollinations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you'll need to do some Mendel stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll need to do some, whatever,
uh, whatever mechanics that you have in
[SPEAKER_01]: your toolbox, you'll need to be ready to
pull them out so that you can make your
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it won't be just as simple as,
uh, crossing this with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be pretty, but it's going to
start with a nice series of recurrent
[SPEAKER_01]: backcrosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, could you hear me out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you take a photo period in an auto
flower, do that cross, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the offspring is going to be 50
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take an auto flower from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Confirmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use that pollen to like an S one
create an S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then would you have feminized auto flowers
at that point, the whole offspring of that
[SPEAKER_00]: or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, it'll, it'll still give you a,
it'll just be a percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every, everything is a percentage in
every, you, you, you think about it like
[SPEAKER_01]: every cross starts half and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every time you do another
successive cross, you knock off another
[SPEAKER_01]: half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it becomes 75 25.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when we think in terms of selfing,
it's not half and half.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more so like a hundred because,
um, it's breeding to itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's doubling up on whatever genes
that, uh, the mother is already
[SPEAKER_01]: expressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever genes, um, that shows dominant
or recessive, um, will be double,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, what it was in her population once she
sells herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit much more faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you think in terms of selfing and
you do get a higher percentage,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a 75 to 25 off the bat,
if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm terrible at math, but I'm,
I think that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched upon testing a little bit,
but I want to get a little bit deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody creates seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before releasing to the public,
they do, they should do a series of tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just released to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do any testing, which could be very
harmful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're, you're pushing things into
the population that it could be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, high percentage of
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, maybe the intersect traits,
it ends up being dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've, you've released it to the
public and all these people are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites happens with the donuts,
triploid, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't seem like they tested,
did a very good job testing that because a
[SPEAKER_00]: large percentage, I want to say 70 plus
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't know for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: She ended up showing intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to avoid using or
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why he said it wasn't
offensive, but, but anyways, what is an
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical way to go about having genetics
tested before releasing to the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, understanding, um,
the mechanics and knowing what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like knowing, I think if people knew what
they were doing, then they would
[SPEAKER_01]: understand what was required.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would be more excited about,
um, because they, they, they would have
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to create and really actually
create and have influence on, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: moving and fixing traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and you're like, Oh man, I didn't
know I could do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think once you get to that point,
you, you take it seriously versus people
[SPEAKER_01]: just taking one, you know, and then it's
selling and then selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, they never even seen
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't, they don't know what they're
giving away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you actually get here to a point of
understanding and learning and get a
[SPEAKER_01]: strong foundation in the basics,
you do become the creator and you do take
[SPEAKER_01]: pride in that and you look at things
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, if you're breeding,
you got a batch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you then give it out to say disperse a
hundred seeds to people or 500 seeds to
[SPEAKER_00]: different people around the world and then
have them grow it out and then kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: give you feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like, is that a good number or
should it be kind of a percentage of the
total?
[SPEAKER_00]: Total number of seeds you get or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, you should never.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's a red flag too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an indication to me that the
breeder is not, um, doesn't really know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on because, um, as a breeder,
I need to build up my eye for selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I constantly say this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you hear people all the time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's not a phenol hunt phenol hunt
is thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no idea what it would take to
look at a thousand plants with all these
[SPEAKER_01]: subtle differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have to train your eye and
start with the four, 10, 20, and gradually
[SPEAKER_01]: you start to notice, uh, changes within
how you see things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, that, that right there is,
is, is what's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, starting small and then building your
eye up so that you can select,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, but not just trying to throw out a
million plants is not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: conducive to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's going to be
counterproductive.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about testing for pathogens,
hoplite and viroid big concern these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can be within the seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've had a plant that hoplite and
viroid and you use that for breeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could potentially end up in the seeds
and you could potentially disperse some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend folks get seeds tests or
plants tested prior to dispersing seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just talking hoplite and viroid,
but there are other pathogens out there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you are operating these
large facilities and you are doing this,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, for profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing this to sell seeds and
make money and you, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you, you have a big facility and all these
things, you need to take every precaution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you should, uh, go over and
beyond, uh, when it comes to stress
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, performance testing, um,
just like, um, any responsible breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: would, um, I don't want, I don't want to
release, I don't want anybody to see
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that is created by me,
but that's less desirable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't, I don't even, even with the
notation of saying, Hey, um, this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: testers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it, if it looks messed up, don't even
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a test.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not so, so nothing leaves my
house messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is already built up strong
confidence, ready to leave the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you step out the door, do you walk
out, you know, like messed up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pants halfway up, you know, dirty,
you haven't shut.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you, you dress up, you brush your
teeth, you, you get yourself together and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: These seeds, these, these genetics don't
leave your house unless they are ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: dress and impress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have like a team of testers
that will test your stuff prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do everything a hundred percent
your eyes, your testing doesn't leave your
[SPEAKER_00]: house unless you're confident with
everything that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've never, um, uh, never,
never, uh, believed in, in testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I come from the dog world
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, there is no, no testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if, if I'm looking for undesirable
trait, that undesirable trait could be
[SPEAKER_01]: aggression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just, Hey man, hold this dog and
let me know if it's aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: One day the dog pulled you out the bed,
you know, so, um, ultimately yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the breeders, it's the breeders
responsibility for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about your creations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the most exciting or
unique strains that you've developed and
[SPEAKER_00]: what makes them stand out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that ops OG is probably,
uh, my, my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a hybrid cross of two land races from
two different areas and, um, two sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: heirlooms, uh, and, uh, that is skunk
number one in UK cheese.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of the other in there's the cow hash
plant and, um, the, uh, you Becca Stan
[SPEAKER_01]: lamb race and, um, one from a cold region,
one from a warmer region, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, lamb race, just the lamb race
influence and being able to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: see the history of, uh, of just the
Bacall, how rich the history is with,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, being able to, um, use that and know
that it is responsible for creating some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the, uh, most valuable hashes around
the world, you know, for thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, right from that region in Northern
Afghanistan and, um, learning the villages
[SPEAKER_01]: and learning the different, um,
and then you Becca Stan, the colder
[SPEAKER_01]: region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love the lamb race influences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, for me, it's just another baby of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's nowhere near complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's probably like five years in the,
in the workings right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working there for about five
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and we constantly just prioritize
it, um, figure what is, uh, important at
[SPEAKER_01]: the moment, um, whether it's the customer
is requiring something, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's always, it's a way you can make it
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that ops OG, I would have to say,
I don't have too many strings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a boondocks blue, which is a auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's usually always on the back
burner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, rarely do I ever work two strings at
once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it requires tons and tons of
populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, so if I'm over here messing
around with 13, 14 different batches of
[SPEAKER_01]: dead OPC, I don't want to be doing nothing
else with no other seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, you know, rarely do I ever work
two strings at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I am working on the auto flower
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's a Siberian ruderalis,
Tom's dead ops photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're doing the, uh, auto flower from
scratch using a recurrent back crossing
[SPEAKER_01]: method and, um, probably some further self
pollination to lock it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, probably take about three,
four years, three, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm assuming hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The opportunity to grow dead ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I had the F two, I grew up like
two of the F twos and then F four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I gave you S ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was they feminized?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that wasn't you.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No wonder you was looking at me like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't sure, but yeah, pretty sure it
was an F two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got some really good results off the
F twos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that kind of opens up the,
the, the characteristics a lot on that
[SPEAKER_00]: generation and the F fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool to see like what really more
of what the breeder is looking for more,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking for, man, that fuel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, actually I'm running out of stock
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got probably going to plant another one
and it's something that I would definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: want to keep on hand at all times to
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, I really like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a vote of confidence for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I'm sure I still got those same
populations hanging around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got S ones, I got F ones, I got,
you know, all dead ops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and they all have a different
purpose, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have a, they're all just a tool
in the toolbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you realize that, that all of
these tools and you realize how important
[SPEAKER_01]: they are and you realize your end goal and
you start to see certain strategies that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to implement, then everything
becomes important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't sell that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, man, what if that guy opens
up a pack and gets what, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: gets what I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps me finish what I'm doing over
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about, um, being objective and
knowing that, uh, it takes time and it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't, we don't do this to,
to make money off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you do this and you find other ways to
make money around it, but no breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is really into this, uh, for,
for money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I mean, you might see some dog guys
that, that are successfully being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: capitalize off of newly created breeds,
but, um, when it comes to guys who really
[SPEAKER_01]: understand, uh, the objective of a
breeder, um, money becomes like the last,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we don't, we don't make money,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we preserve genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We save endangered species, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we, we actually have a hand in doing
something great and being a part of
[SPEAKER_01]: history and saying, man, that pterodactyl
over there, man, he was about to die,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I was able to help bring those eggs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, whatever, whatever it may
be, uh, a dog, a puppy, a cat,
[SPEAKER_01]: a rabbit, um, if it's endangered,
um, and you know, you have the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: help recreate and replenish, um,
and not only that, but, um, enhance,
[SPEAKER_01]: so make it better, um, so that other
people can have it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what this is really all
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you walk into any of your local,
uh, shops, whatever you want to call them,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, none of them have lamb races.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they don't have that available for you
because they're endangered species as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just think about that the next time you
are looking for your next, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: two mother and father to breed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, think about some of these poly hybrids
who are responsible for, um, almost
[SPEAKER_01]: eradicating our history when it comes to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lamb races and wild types are the
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just do away with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just be excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, off the, uh, of the lack of knowledge
and just be excited off the names and the
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and, and, you know, um,
the hype, uh, and then forget all about
[SPEAKER_01]: our responsibility and our history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear that you take an ethical
approach when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely one thing I admire
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, behind the scenes,
I've, we've had conversations through dams
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff where I firing off breeding
questions on you and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're somewhat of a mentor towards me and
really chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only cross I've ever done is,
uh, somewhat influenced by you and your
[SPEAKER_00]: directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just keep going, keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your time and don't, don't,
you know, realize what it is you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go left.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to go right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your choice, you know, and then you
take your time and make that choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, it'll, it'll,
it'll be something of a household name 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You stick to it 20 years from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, make it so that people remember it
for, for, for good reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, for the guys that are just Chuck,
Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck, Chuck,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll never have a household name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody will ever remember it, man,
because you don't even remember it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: He created last week.
[SPEAKER_01]: He created so many, but, uh, you know,
it's chill out.
[SPEAKER_01]: OG has the ability to, to, to be a legacy
within our industry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep chugging at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will do, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about the future, what trends
or innovations in breeding are you most
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you see the future of breeding
evolving?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I hold this game to such a high
pedestal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so a lot of times my, my peers,
unless it's like my team, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't really grasp the concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't see that far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, and I always tell people if you
need to see where I'm looking at,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you need to view things from my lens,
then you have to step outside of our
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our community is not okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a place where they support
education and they're going into the
[SPEAKER_01]: colleges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, learn this, learn this about your
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but when it comes to, um, breeding
dogs, breeding daisies, breeding corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding strawberries, they are doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you learn the mechanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to step outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, that's the largest
mistake of many of these, um, so-called
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders is that they start here as
growers and they think it's just that
[SPEAKER_01]: simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then boom, they don't realize that
that education is not going to come from
[SPEAKER_01]: here because it's not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding, well, breeding this plant is not
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's not a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even a real thing yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are so far ahead of time when it
comes to our industry, step outside of our
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, learn the real mechanics and
then prepare yourself for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, to answer your question and not
ramble on, um, I hold it to a high
[SPEAKER_01]: pedestal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't take a pig to a pig competition
without it being registered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know it's registration number.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to know the name, the father,
the mother, the seven generation pedigree.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going to be in this competition,
that's a pig.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, and it should be the same for,
for what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, everything and all of these cups,
man, I'm not even, you can't even walk up
[SPEAKER_01]: and say you want to be inside this cup
unless you have a 20 generation pedigree
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to lamb rigs that can show
every mother, father and ancestor in the
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's gaps in that ancestry,
then we can't consider you a pure bread.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't consider you a thoroughbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't consider you a pure species.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just can't because there's no proof of
registration here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't bring my dog no matter how cool my
dog looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does backflips.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can swim across the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can do all of these tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I bring it to the dog show,
if it's not registered, uh, with a three
[SPEAKER_01]: generation pedigree on file, then they're
going to be like, no, it can look like all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other Jack Russell terriers,
but, um, it could outperform them all as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it won't even take you serious if
you don't have the proper registration
[SPEAKER_01]: paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, um, that's where I want to
see this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to take legalization federally
one day and it's going to take some genius
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out of high school or college to
code some program.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's identical to what they did over
there as seed finder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you ever, uh, you know,
familiar with that, then they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: database with the lineage and that is
super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, from dogs to horses, to pigs,
to corn, to everything that we take
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously, the fruits and vegetables you
eat in the supermarket all require that
[SPEAKER_01]: lineage, that documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all require it, or it can't be bred
within what we got going as a mutt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You consider it a mutt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing that the, how the industry is
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are so many pollen chuckers and
people just creating random crosses and
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for me to even visualize that
far ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're probably right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just me being a general consumer,
small home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, man, imagine if we could get to
that level to where like in order to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: a cup, you have to show documentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're not there yet, but that would
be cool if it was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's, that has to be the next
level, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's the norm with everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that's legal is the norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, nothing, nothing we eat, nothing we
consume, nothing, um, none of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: livestock animals, pets.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those are considered pure unless
it's registered with, because that
[SPEAKER_01]: registration and those, that pedigree,
um, it gives you the ability to what we
[SPEAKER_01]: say, uh, what we consider confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives you the ability to conform to,
to, to the breed standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, if you have all your registration,
you have all your paperwork you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I can take you seriously and look at
your dog and then check them out and say
[SPEAKER_01]: the ears.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the tail has a little crook in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not breed standard is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if we pass that registration,
there's still, that just gets you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: initial test of saying, let's now let's
look at your dog and see if it's a real
[SPEAKER_01]: pure dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it has all of these champions in his
bloodline and in his pedigree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if it's a champion as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or if it's just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, a dog with paperwork that we don't
consider, um, breed standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing with, with, you know,
and it is hard to see, because one thing
[SPEAKER_01]: we have to understand too, um,
our industry and the guys that run our
[SPEAKER_01]: community, that have been running a
community of big companies, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen chukas, whatever, they have us
desensitized to weak genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they have us desensitized to
hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the, especially the new
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I try to come, I try to combat
that by saying, no, um, there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do to my plans to make them
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing you can do to make them expose
weakness.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's my responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm willing to say that in,
in, in announced that, uh, so that other
[SPEAKER_01]: people can take it serious enough so that
they can, um, be able to do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep fighting that good fight,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, hopefully we see some positive
change here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, uh, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Zaza genetics.com, the website will do
a, uh, mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow at 50% off coupon code as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, so all you guys want to check
some out, just, uh, use coupon code,
[SPEAKER_01]: mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow, uh, Instagram Zaza.genetics
.official.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch me in the discord, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the discord every night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nine PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to do classes every night,
but the, the team, uh, my current team
[SPEAKER_01]: has, uh, they kind of, they kind of smart
yard, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like, they bore me now cause they
think they know everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need some new fresh minds, man,
to kick it with me in discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me, let me rock with you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's, let's, uh, let's,
let's build you up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get you prepared and let's drop you
off in the community to, to combat this,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, this, this breeding, uh, epidemic that
we have known as pollen chuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to change the game one way or
the other through QCE.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quality community education.
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring quality to the community only
through education.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hit me up, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always in a discord, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm nine PM Eastern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, always want to chop it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Zaza's
YouTube channel down in the description.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a new YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fairly new.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely need some subscribers for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So click the link in the description
section below to get to his channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of topics that aren't
really covered anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of breeders that are
making YouTube content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's that channel I tune into
every now and then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever you're a new video pops up,
I'm usually clicking on it and I'm just
[SPEAKER_00]: like learning every single thing I'm
learning from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep doing what you're doing,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to the Patreon folks that keep
this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.com slash Mr. Grow it a hundred
percent of what is pledged through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go right back into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to the Patreon supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a question for the audience
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should we ask them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Favorite cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's a good one?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your favorite cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know because I'm always looking for
new genetics and I'd love to see what you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys have grown out recently that is your
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll grow something out in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Zaza.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you so much for coming on that
podcast once again.
