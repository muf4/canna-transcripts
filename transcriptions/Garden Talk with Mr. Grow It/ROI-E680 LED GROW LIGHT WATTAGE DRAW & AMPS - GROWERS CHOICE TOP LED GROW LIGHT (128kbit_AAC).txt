[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, I've got a quick
video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ROI E680 LED grow light by
Growers Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody had reached out to me and
asked me, what is the wattage draw for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different levels that the light is dimmed
down?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular grow light does have a
dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be dimmed down from 100% down to
80%, 60%, and 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to use my kilowatt meter and
find out what the wattage draw is for
[SPEAKER_00]: those different levels, as well as the
amperage draw as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's start at 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 40%, it is pulling 2.25 amps,
263 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bumping it up to 60%, it's pulling 3.32
amps, 392 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80%, 4.72 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: 558 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, bumping it all the way up,
full blast, 100%, 5.87 amps, 690 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for more info on this
light, I have put a link in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did an unboxing video on this
light, so I will link that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
