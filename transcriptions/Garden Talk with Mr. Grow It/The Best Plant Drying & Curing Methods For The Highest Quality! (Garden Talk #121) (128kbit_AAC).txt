[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with David Sandelman.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are the inventor of the Canitrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually using one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using it for over a year now,
and we met at a conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I filmed some footage with you explaining
the Canitrol in detail, the Cool Cure,
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually one of my videos is
dedicated, showing mostly you explaining
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has over 100,000 views.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know a lot of my audience is aware of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're familiar with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really happy today to be able to
sit down with you and really dig deeper
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Canitrol and really drawing and
curing in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of misinformation when it
comes to that process, a lot of lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've learned a lot just in the
past three to five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of sitting down with you,
catching us up to speed, I think is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be real valuable for my audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get deep into the question,
could you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and kind of how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my background is in designing
control systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how I got into this world was solving
a problem for cheesemakers, aging cheese,
[SPEAKER_00]: which led to charcuterie meat,
which then led over to gardening and
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot was by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a wine cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why a wine cooler?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's an insulated box with a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: No different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have used a freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have used a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have used the Yeti cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I needed was an insulated box
with a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the simplest thing to start
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the size was about right for an
insulated box with a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then applied the technology for
controlling the vapor pressure in the
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then provided that to a local grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he had lots of plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his first comments were, it's not
going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only dry my flower when it's hanging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were shelves in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, humor me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put the flower in there and try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not come out as nice as you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hanging a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And about a week or two later,
I went back to his shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, I don't know what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is some of the best flower I've
ever produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, can I have the box back?
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used it for well over a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first prototypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wound up in it, you know, I'm going to
say a lot by accident.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming out of cheese and meat and saying,
here's another product that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove extra water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is this extra water?
[SPEAKER_00]: This water is unbound water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unbound water is what molds and
microbes feed and grow on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you eliminate that unbound water,
so the only water left is bound water that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they starve to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a shelf-stable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the food industry, in the
pharmaceutical industry, they use water
[SPEAKER_00]: activity as the unit of measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't talk about percent moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the bound and unbound
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to make sure that there's
not enough unbound water for microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: mold to grow on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you have a shelf-stable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you don't want to do in food,
in pharmaceuticals, and in our world,
[SPEAKER_00]: is take out bound water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because every molecule of bound water you
remove from that is weight off the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sell their product by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a commodity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to remove weight and
just waste that weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why, you know, you want to use
water activity, bound, unbound water,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the units of measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little bit circular description of
how it got started, but that ties into
[SPEAKER_00]: where it all started with cheese and meat
and applying the same physics,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same technology to a flour that you
want shelf-stability and that you want a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good, high-quality product that
you're not removing weight since you're
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what year was Cannatrol established as
a company and then the CoolCure,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the home-grown dry box,
what year was that invented?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about four years ago that I tinkered
with the first prototype and we tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we gave it to this caregiver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once he said, yeah, this really works,
we went to a little advocacy group here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vermont where it was home growers gathered
and traded notes and they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: competition for their home-grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we brought a box there, put it on a
six-foot folding table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we sold three or four of them
right on the spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when my wife and I looked at
each other and said, maybe we have
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went home and built a couple more.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been using it for over a year,
like I mentioned, and I think it's a game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has helped me out so much when it comes
to drying, just being hands off more,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not having to mess with a
humidifier, a fan, you know, within a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tent, I'm able to actually harvest,
put it into the box, press the on button
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go on vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happened to me twice now where I
literally had to harvest and went on
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation and came back several days later
and it was good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the convenience factor was a big thing
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the CoolCure, one thing you
emphasize is dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers go by relative humidity,
but you go by dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain the difference between the
two and why there's an emphasis on dew
[SPEAKER_01]: point versus relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is a common question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relative humidity, the first word
relative, it's a relative value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And relative humidity is made up of two
variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two variables that make up
relative humidity is the temperature of
[SPEAKER_00]: the air and the amount of moisture in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you change either of those
variables, the relative humidity is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people say, oh, I can control
relative humidity, well, in reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not a controllable variable unto
itself because it's made up of two,
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature and the amount of water,
which we call dew point in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: An analogy I like to use is let's say you
have a loan and you want to change your
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's no dial to turn up or down
to change your monthly payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the interest rate,
that'll change your monthly payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the principal amount of the
loan, that'll change your monthly payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can change the term of the loan,
that will change your monthly payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's no individual thing that you
can dial up and down, that is the monthly
[SPEAKER_00]: payment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monthly payment is the result of these
other variables, be it the length of the
[SPEAKER_00]: loan, the principality of the loan,
the interest of the loan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relative humidity is the outcome of the
temperature of the air and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move either of those and you move the
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're controlling the two components.
[SPEAKER_00]: That make up relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so dew point is the amount of water
and the temperature, dry bulb temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the amount of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, you can add or subtract the
temperature of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's easy, heat it, cool it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can add or subtract moisture in the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by controlling those two variables,
that's where you wind up with your
[SPEAKER_00]: resultant humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at the end of the day, when you're
drying and curing flour, the relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity is no longer important if you're
able to control the two important
[SPEAKER_00]: variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the air temperature around the
flour and how much moisture or the vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure around the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you hold the right vapor
pressure, and we found that a 54 degree
[SPEAKER_00]: dew point, which relates to vapor
pressure, that's interchangeable numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flour will dry to equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor pressure of the flour will get
reduced down to that vapor pressure of a
[SPEAKER_00]: 54 degree dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, it's at equilibrium, the flour
won't dry anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can go on vacation and you
can even say, you know what, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_00]: home, I'm going to spend another week on
vacation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you get home, the flour is not
going to over dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it came during your first week's
vacation down to equilibrium to match that
[SPEAKER_00]: dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you spend another week away,
it's just going to hold there at that same
[SPEAKER_00]: dew point at equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening now is you're increasing
the cure on the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, other things are going on,
the ripening into trichomes and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, but it's not going to over dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that also eliminates before you would
put the flour in a space with an air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioner, a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are they designed to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly remove water.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you buy a dehumidifier, it's rated in
pints per day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will do that forever until it turns
your flour into crispy little bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's why at some point we would dry,
then cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we had to arrest the drying
process because the room with the air
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioners and dehumidifiers would just
keep sucking water out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then move it to a sealed container to
arrest that drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in a cool cure, it's at the finished
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it stores there and holds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it really comes into the
vapor troll technology is my next
[SPEAKER_01]: question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do want to mention,
which kind of reminds me of dew point
[SPEAKER_01]: versus relative humidity is similar to
like EC versus PPM, where electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: conductivity is kind of that absolute
value.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then PPM is just a calculation of the
EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that kind of reminds me of dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC and then RH being the PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of similar in the sense to where
people are still using PPM, but EC is a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more accurate in that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the primary unit of measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That dew point is a primary unit of
measure where relative humidity is a
[SPEAKER_00]: calculated value on the dew point and the
temperature combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the equation works out to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, getting into the vapor troll
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is something that you've
created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's a trademark patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you can correct me if I'm on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What exactly is the vapor troll
technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we've been able to do is control
the vapor pressure in the space as a
[SPEAKER_00]: controllable variable, which is the dew
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when I say vapor pressure,
I'm talking dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm saying dew point, I'm talking vapor
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an equation where you put E is at
one side vapor pressure and then in all
[SPEAKER_00]: these other radicals and brackets and
stuff like that are the Ts, which are the
[SPEAKER_00]: dew point temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can flip the equation either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we can use that interchangeably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up until now, air conditioning systems,
dehumidifiers have what's called a
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible to latent ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when you start cooling air,
once you cool it below the dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: condensation forms and you start drying
the air because that water comes out as
[SPEAKER_00]: droplets on the fins on the evaporator
coil and drops out and you're removing
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those units have this sensible latent
ratio, which is pretty well fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it says, let's say you have a 70-30
kind of split.
[SPEAKER_00]: It means 70% of the energy goes to cooling
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 30% of the energy goes to drying the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: What our patents are about is we have
split that so we can independently control
[SPEAKER_00]: the dry bulb temperature, which is the
sensible capacity of a heating or cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: system and the latent capacity,
the amount of moisture we can remove from
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, by doing that, we can zero in and get
you the dry bulb temperature and the dew
[SPEAKER_00]: point temperature that you need to get to
the perfect conditions for drying,
[SPEAKER_00]: curing, and storing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, we have two patents issued.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a third one, back and forth
normal course of dealing with the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States Patent Office and a fourth
application about to go in with the Patent
[SPEAKER_00]: Office.
[SPEAKER_00]: The European Patent Office has already
approved this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have patents in several European
and foreign countries as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, on the CoolCure, you can have
different settings, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people think that it's
fixed on the default settings,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can actually change that.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, what is your recommended or
default dry and cure settings that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have on the CoolCure?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we ship the units.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of them out there and
proven over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 68 degree dry bulb temperature and a 53
to 54 degree dew point is the best
[SPEAKER_00]: settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you lower the dry bulb temperature,
it takes longer to dry the material and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a longer period that you potentially
have unbound water where you have the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility of microbes and mold to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, at the settings we have, we get to a
target water activity in about four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we recommend four additional days
of cure so things can ripen and get
[SPEAKER_00]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's a lot of discussion about
60-60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first of all, we get a lot of people,
they get our unit and they go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I'm going to set it to 60-60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the two readings on the unit,
the first is the dry bulb temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they set that at 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then they set the dew point to 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when the temperature is 60 and the
dew point is 60, you are at 100% relative
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at saturation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've created fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the perfect conditions to take
everything you put in the unit and turn it
[SPEAKER_00]: into one moldy gooey mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can't confuse 60% relative
humidity with a 60 degree dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we've looked into trying to find the
origins of where did this 60-60 come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we do know that a 60% relative
humidity will equate back through a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of equations to a .6 water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, there's some science behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the 60 degree temperature,
what we can surmise is when people started
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it in rooms with air conditioners,
if you brought it into your bedroom and
[SPEAKER_00]: you hung the flower up and the thermostat
was set at 68 degrees and the compressor
[SPEAKER_00]: ran for a couple of minutes every,
you know, a couple of times an hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it wasn't running long enough to dry
the air because it's only taking moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the air when the compressor is
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, how do we solve the problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: They would turn down the thermostat to
force the compressor to run as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible so as actively removing moisture
from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you look at most mini-splits with
wireless remotes or air conditioning
[SPEAKER_00]: thermostats, they only go down to 60
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, is there science behind the 60 degrees
or is the 60 degrees because that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: most thermostats will only go down to,
which it was set to, to force the
[SPEAKER_00]: compressor to run to constantly remove
moisture from the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't really gotten to the source of
where the came from, but pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we've come up with leads to,
that's the limit of home thermostats where
[SPEAKER_00]: you are hanging your flower to dry and dry
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who I really have talked to over
the years have told me, hey, 60-60,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the best way to dry it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the commercial facilities implement
that and they're using the 60-60,
[SPEAKER_01]: but is that really the best way or is that
kind of like a bro science technique where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's really no studies to back it up?
[SPEAKER_01]: That debate still goes on today for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the best that was available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what did we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with the research coalition and
they ran flower at 60-60 and they also ran
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, well, that's 60 degrees
temperature and 60% relative humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: ran it side by side with a cool cure that
was set at the factory defaults of 68
[SPEAKER_00]: degree dry bulb and a 50-40 degree dew
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've now put out a white paper and the
terpenes were 16% higher coming out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cool cure with a 68 degree dry bulb and a
54 degree dew point as compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: room that was at 60-60 legacy
conventional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the data is out and there is a white
paper out now that goes through all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: sciency stuff that the PhD people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, you hear about the higher the
temperature, the more terpene loss there
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpenes volatize at the higher
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think the reason for, I haven't
seen the white paper, do you think the
[SPEAKER_01]: overall result, one of the reasons why it
resulted in that is the consistency in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions and that being inconsistent
with the 60-60 method, kind of up and down
[SPEAKER_01]: swings with temperature and humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are currently undergoing now research
into what might be happening and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things and it is yet to be proven and
demonstrated, but this is the path we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going down, is that with conventional
equipment, every time the refrigeration
[SPEAKER_00]: compressor cycles on and off, whether it's
with an air conditioner or whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: with a dehumidifier, when that liquid
refrigerant is injected into the
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporator coil in that piece of
equipment, the temperatures are down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the mid-20 degree Fahrenheit below 30s and
then when the compressor turns back off,
[SPEAKER_00]: well that coil is no longer cold,
so the dew point and the vapor pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: rises.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, every time the compressor cycles on
and off, the vapor pressure dew point is
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling up and down, up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now think of the tops of your trichomes,
these nice little bulbs, and inside these
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs are all the terpenes and all the
good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we're imagining is happening,
and this is what we're doing with electron
[SPEAKER_00]: microscopes and digital microscopes,
is to see if the cycling is causing these
[SPEAKER_00]: bulbs on top to expand and contract,
expand and contract, and expand and
[SPEAKER_00]: contract, and eventually weaken and fail,
and now you're losing your terpenes once
[SPEAKER_00]: they fail, and what we're hearing about is
shelf stability if, by us holding a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant vapor pressure, that those
trichome heads are able to ripen and
[SPEAKER_00]: become more sturdy and more durable,
and so that way, not until you grind and
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke that flour, do you now release those
goodies, those terpenes that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: those trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have the technology to maintain
stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: True, very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But taking a step back, one thing I did
want to just touch upon is we get lots of
[SPEAKER_01]: people asking, can the cool care be set to
60-60?
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to adjust the dew point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have it memorized, but there is a
setting for 60 degrees Fahrenheit,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the dew point can be set so you
can achieve that 60% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, if you're a tinker like me,
like I've tried it with the 60-60,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried 63-60, I've tried 65-60,
I've tried 68-60, so I've messed around
[SPEAKER_01]: with it quite a bit and really don't
notice too much of a difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh-huh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you're getting into the
nuances, and with every unit, a shift,
[SPEAKER_00]: an instruction manual, and in the back of
the manual is a chart, and you can look up
[SPEAKER_00]: for any given relative humidity
temperature what the dew point is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, on that chart, you would look up the
60-degree dry bulb, you would look across
[SPEAKER_00]: the chart to find the 60% relative
humidity, and then it will tell you what
[SPEAKER_00]: the dew point setting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're definitely then causing the
machine to work harder because it's having
[SPEAKER_00]: to run at lower temperatures, and it's not
a refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no compressor, so, you know,
it's not designed to be cooling to those,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it can, but, you know,
its sweet spot is where they run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood, and so the default settings on
the CoolCure equals a dry length to be
[SPEAKER_01]: four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people may say that's a little bit
too fast, others say that's perfectly
[SPEAKER_01]: fine, that's probably the fastest you want
to dry at.
[SPEAKER_01]: What length of dry is too fast,
and what are the downsides for a fast dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's start with what's the
definition of dry, and what have people
[SPEAKER_00]: been using as a unit of measure for dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: They typically were probably looking at
stem snapping, which is a pretty arbitrary
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, or moisture content, and when
you're looking at moisture content,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that's not representative of bound
and unbound water, which is expressed by
[SPEAKER_00]: way of water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, when we say the flower is dry,
we're talking about achieving a water
[SPEAKER_00]: activity of .6, which means it's now
shelf-stable, that you've removed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: unbound water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at that point, is someone going to
consider it dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: We like to see four more days of cure on
it, even though the water activity is no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but what can happen is if you dry some
of something too quickly, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: doable, if you put that flower in a very
low dew point space, very low vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure space, you can do what's called
case hardening, and this also applies to
[SPEAKER_00]: the food industry, that the outer water
leaves very quickly, and that causes a
[SPEAKER_00]: case hardening, and you trap water inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: The inside water can't get out because
you've sort of created a casing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, and that happens in charcuterie.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drying a salami, and you dry the
casing on the outside too quickly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the moisture in the center of that meat
can't get out anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've case hardened it, and what you will
wind up with is rancid meat, because your
[SPEAKER_00]: water activity in the center is still too
high, and microbes and all kinds of other
[SPEAKER_00]: nasties can breed in there because there's
still free available water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the mechanics probably apply perfectly
well to a flower that you remove the water
[SPEAKER_00]: out of too fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it, and I know just from smoking
perception, it can become very harsh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fast dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed a hay smell on a lot of
things that I've dried real fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's just been very harsh and not
pleasant when consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, on the other end of things,
when talking about the length of dry being
[SPEAKER_01]: too slow, how many days would you say is
kind of too slow of a dry, and what are
[SPEAKER_01]: the downsides of having a slow dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so back to water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The longer you have free available water
in that flower, the longer that flower is
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to the possibility of mold and
growth going on in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you don't want it sitting around with
free available water for an extended
[SPEAKER_00]: length of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's why we like hitting that
water activity in about four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as number of days, though,
I've heard as low as, well, as maximum of
[SPEAKER_01]: as 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't go any more than 10 days
through drying, at least bringing that
[SPEAKER_01]: water activity down to the .6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you agree with that or disagree with
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is 10 days or longer too long?
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would not want it any longer
than it needs to be because any day longer
[SPEAKER_00]: is another day you are exposed to the
possibility of mold and bacterial growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back to what our, you know,
objective is, is to get to a shelf stable
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, at four days, you're
pretty, you know, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you get the water activity down
to a .6 in one day?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You probably wind up case hardening it and
not be able to get unbound water out from
[SPEAKER_00]: the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're typically seeing by day four,
your water activity at .6, but then
[SPEAKER_00]: another four days of cure, and there might
be during those additional four days,
[SPEAKER_00]: some additional equalization of water
activity throughout the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the end of eight days,
you have really high quality, smokable
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, not harsh, smooth, but you can then
leave it there 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last night, we pulled golden goat out of a
cool cure that's been in there a month
[SPEAKER_00]: short of a year, and it's still sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've touched upon it several times now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of folks here that are tuning
in that this is the first time they're
[SPEAKER_01]: ever hearing of water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that might be more on the
beginner stage or whatever, for whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: reason, this is the first time they're
actually hearing about water activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned .6.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is .6 the target?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a little deeper into water
activity?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the actual target?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is .6 the target?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so there's been all kinds of
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water activity is a unit of measure that's
been used for decades by the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry, by the food
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only deal in water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we are speculating is if there's
rescheduling from schedule one to schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: three, and the FDA gets involved,
FDA talks water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone's got to learn water activity
because that's the unit of measure they
[SPEAKER_00]: look at for shelf stability and product,
you know, that's a unit of measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with decades of research and stuff,
at .6, the microbes and mold that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be harmful can no longer survive
in an object, something that has a .6
[SPEAKER_00]: water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even museums that have rare documents
measure water activity, and they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure those documents at .6 or lower
because they don't want mold and microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat up those rare documents and open up
a box and there's dust in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they, too, are interested in water
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's where food industry uses water
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever get those little cracker
cheese sandwiches, now cheese you would
[SPEAKER_00]: think is wet, and a cracker is dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why, after you open that package,
after it's been in there for months,
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't those crackers mushy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they make sure that the cheese and
the crackers are at the same water
[SPEAKER_00]: activity when they're manufactured and put
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now with the same water activity,
there's no water that can transfer from
[SPEAKER_00]: the cheese to the cracker or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking percent moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking water activity, which is
sort of a unit of measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why those crackers don't get
soggy from the cheese, because you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: normally say cheese is wet, cracker is
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all about the science of water
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all kinds of research and
Wikipedia and stuff that talks about water
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're taking a technology that's been
used for decades with all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: research and understanding and now just
applying it to something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But physics stills apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are these charts and diagrams
that show water activity at .9,
[SPEAKER_00]: .8, .7, .6, .5.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through the different values,
they show which microbials can flourish,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, where the cutoff line is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they find is once you get to .6,
you're in a happy, safe place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, the number is .65 is where all of
the nasties you don't want to grow fall
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get down to a .65, there's no
longer that water to free available water
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like to say .6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got that little half a point in
there from .6 to .65 down to .6 to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we're in the happy zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm drying in my cool cure and it goes
to that four-day dry cycle on the default
[SPEAKER_01]: settings, it's safe to assume at that
point that the product inside is at the .6
[SPEAKER_01]: water activity at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's at the default settings we set
it at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've not done extensive research at the
6060 number, because, well, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've tested it where the factory settings
are and where people have the most
[SPEAKER_00]: success.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will you get to a .6 water activity
with the 6060 equivalent value?
[SPEAKER_00]: That I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be a day or two longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that the lower the
temperature, the slower it is to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might push you into that five-day,
six-days, but without testing enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you touch upon vapor pressure
several times so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another thing that I feel like
a lot of my viewers are going to hear VPD
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to be like, wait a
minute, the plant's not growing anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD doesn't really matter, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, using VPD while the
plant is growing, it controls the stomata
[SPEAKER_01]: opening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when the plant is drying,
there's no real stomata for it to open.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really affect in that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD applies to a living plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant is actively putting
water out through the stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to that, if you know what
your leaf surface temperature is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can calculate the saturated vapor
pressure of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a vapor pressure at the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you want to set up the vapor
pressure in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you want to set up a difference
between the two so that the water leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf can freely flow into the room and
not hang out underneath the leaf where
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get microbial growth,
mold, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are basically maintaining a vapor
pressure difference between the leaf and
[SPEAKER_00]: the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost think about a pump maintains a
pressure difference between in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sort of creating this difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's this constant flow of the water
vapor from the leaf into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want it to fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a constant flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's take that leaf, the flower that
you just cut off.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dead now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a finite amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more roots connected to it to
bring up water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got an absolute amount of water
it's starting with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it has a vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're going to put it in a space
like a cool cure which has a lower vapor
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vapor pressure is set based on the
54 degree dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that flower has a higher vapor
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not going to talk about vapor
pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen is that flower is
just going to start losing water because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's at a higher vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's now going to consistently go
lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until it comes to equilibrium with the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've dried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vapor pressure deficit is a proper term
for a flower room, live plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: water constantly coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you talk about vapor pressure
deficit when you take a knife and put it
[SPEAKER_00]: through the sidewall of a tire?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a vapor pressure difference
when the tire is full.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you pull the knife out when
the tire is flat, they've now equalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor pressure in the tire is the same
as outside the tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a flat tire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before you cut the hole in the tire,
there was a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really don't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the tire's at 30 PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the tire's at zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower had a high vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at equilibrium to the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there an ideal vapor pressure for
drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is curing storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 54 degree dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know 54 degree dew point,
you can calculate vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a linear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a one for one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a straight equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in dew point and it gives you
vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put in vapor pressure and it gives you
dew point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the flower starting at?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a live flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends probably on the cultivar,
the size of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those can vary how much water is in
that flower when it's freshly picked.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all we do know is it's wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put it in an
environment like a cool cure where the
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure is known.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that flower is going to lose its
excess water until it comes to equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: with the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point it's going to be at a
0.6 water activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to have any unbound water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at shelf stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got happy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after the drying comes curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is another debated topic here as
far as length of cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long does flower need to cure for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find you like to have a minimum of
four days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like eight days from when you put a
flower into a cool cure, eight days later
[SPEAKER_00]: you're smoking some pretty amazing flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we have learned and experienced
firsthand is that different cultivars age
[SPEAKER_00]: differently, cure differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can think about wines and how
some wines, the day they make it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's drinkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you let it sit for two years or 20
years, it's not going to get any better if
[SPEAKER_00]: anything is going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where there are other wines that when
they're freshly made aren't so good to
[SPEAKER_00]: drink and you got to let it lay for 20
years to mature and then it gets better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had that same firsthand experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew a jilly bean and an Acapulco gold
side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvested them both, put them in a cool
cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: At eight days the jilly bean as always a
favorite it was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried the Acapulco gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was harsh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like this is disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a bit of snobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's throw it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, let's leave it in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days later that Acapulco became the new
favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we learned is that that particular
cultivar does better with a longer period
[SPEAKER_00]: of cure time as compared to let's say a
jilly bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got some commercial facilities
who said, we've come back with them and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, I really would prefer now what I
know to have a different dry cure room for
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of my cultivars because I can see
the difference and having one room I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to compromise to come up with the best for
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear about that, but you explaining
the difference between just those two
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty mind blowing that it can be
such a big difference between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happened now is you have an
environment that's repeatable and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So up until now, without having that
consistent repeatable environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were too many random things that
would affect the drying phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the curing phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at what point did you arrest the
drying and put it into a jar or then
[SPEAKER_00]: burping?
[SPEAKER_00]: What time did you open that jar to burp it
in the middle of the winter when it's bone
[SPEAKER_00]: dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or did you open it to burp it in the
middle of the summer when it's soaking wet
[SPEAKER_00]: outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: All those would affect the outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really couldn't tell what your
outcome was caused by and all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other random, uncontrollable environmental
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have the ability to put a flower
and it doesn't matter what time of year it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, it doesn't matter where you are in the
high desert or down in Florida or on the
[SPEAKER_00]: coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have the same results in
the box repeatedly over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about a wine fridge versus a
canna troll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've gotten comments on videos,
particularly the ones talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: CoolCure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a review video and I did a video
kind of just talking about the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people had said, oh,
I'll just buy a wine fridge and dry in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about the differences between
trying to dry in a wine fridge versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: canna troll?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reality is we need a sealed box,
an insulated box with a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can buy these boxes, insulated
boxes with doors that were originally
[SPEAKER_00]: designed to be a wine fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's all we're getting is the
insulated box with the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing else about it other than
its visual look or size that makes it a
[SPEAKER_00]: wine fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an insulated box with a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we put all our technology into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's some pretty advanced patented
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like you can put some beers in
there and keep them cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's an insulated box with a door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have cooling systems in there per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you would put in a fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what helps us, because these things
are expensive to build, and we're building
[SPEAKER_00]: them here in the US and we take really
good care of our staff and they're well
[SPEAKER_00]: taken care of, it gets expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the places we are able to help
control the cost is to buy an insulated
[SPEAKER_00]: box with a door that is made by the
millions for another hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're able to help reduce that cost
of materials by repurposing what is
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out to be an insulated box with a
door that otherwise could be destined to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a wine cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would happen if somebody tried to
dry in just a wine fridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll mess up because there's no vapor
pressure control.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no control other than temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't waste your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just use your regular household
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because moisture is kind of being removed
in that sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast dry, over dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No control of vapor pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what will happen is it'll continue
drying, drying, drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like any other system, you're now
going to be back to a two-step process
[SPEAKER_00]: where, okay, is it dry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it dry enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I got to address the drying,
take it out and then go put it in sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I took it out too soon,
and there's still free available water
[SPEAKER_00]: when I put it in that sealed container,
I need to burp that sealed container or
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get stuff moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if I took it out and it was too late
and now I put it in that sealed container
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I open that sealed container
repeatedly in a very dry climate,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just continuing to over dry that
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, a wine cooler won't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nor will a dehydrator do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple people had mentioned in the
comments section like, oh, I'll just take
[SPEAKER_01]: a sponge just like the canitrol has,
and I'll put that in the wine fridge for
[SPEAKER_01]: drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that'll help adjust the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, back to adjusting humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We covered that topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then where do they dial in the vapor
pressure at dew point, which is what's
[SPEAKER_00]: really controlling the drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: All they can control is the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wine fridge, no brainer for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about for just curing and
storage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say that they store and dry jars,
Mason jars, and the jar is sealed and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have humidity controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they have one of those humidity
packets in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's controlled and they put that in
the wine fridge just for curing and
[SPEAKER_01]: storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an acceptable thing to do or would
you advise against that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they already have a cool cure,
there's no reason to do any of that
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're taking their flower out of
a controlled environment that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain it at the exact precise vapor
pressure for long-term curing and storing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going to put it into a jar and
screw the lid on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know exactly what the environment
is in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we can add disicant packs into that
jar, which are now trying to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor pressure in that jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where they already took it out of a box
where they had it under perfect control,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now they're trying to do it another
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of extra steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not really sure what the objective
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where in a cool cure, we now offer hemp
bags, where you take your finished flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it in a hemp bag, and you just
leave it in there on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mark the hemp bag with a Sharpie,
what the cultivar was, what the harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: date, and over a period of time you have a
whole library in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You open the door, let's see, what are we
going to smoke today?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want some of this, you know,
Kush, one of this blueberries,
[SPEAKER_00]: some, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using the brown paper bags
because I think you guys were using that
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, the hemp bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was using those ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to pick up some hemp bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's say they don't have a can of
troll and they just want to store in the
[SPEAKER_01]: wine fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, if they, then yeah, then they're
looking to, if they've got the flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: some, target water activity, and not
moisture content, and they put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: jar, and the conditions of the air,
you know, when they close the jar are
[SPEAKER_00]: about where it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they put some disicant pack to help
stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then putting it in a wine cooler is
maintaining a stable temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it brings up an interesting
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you talk, we go back to the
6060.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you talk to the wine world,
oh, wine likes to be stored at 55 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, has anyone sat down with a glass of
wine and asked the wine what its optimum
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, where is it happy to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reality is, four, 500 years ago,
a thousand years ago, they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: drinking wine a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that if you keep it in
caves, that's where you keep it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's unique about a cave?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a stable temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the mean temperature underground is 55
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was 55 designed for the wine,
or did the wine happen to be in stable
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature caves that happen to be at 55?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that wine's happy at 58,
or maybe that wine's happy at 52.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know for sure if you put it at 90,
it's not gonna be so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there magic about the 55,
or is the magic about keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature stable where you store it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now back to, yes, keep that flower in
stable temperature conditions at a minimum
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't have control of the vapor
pressure of the flower at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other devices that are
often compared to the Canitrol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What if somebody dried in a humidor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a sufficient drying system?
[SPEAKER_00]: The humidor's don't have active vapor
pressure control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, they're holding some
temperature, and then they're typically
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled with a disicant pack of some
sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then another one is the egg
incubator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you dry in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do eggs like to incubate underneath
the chicken?
[SPEAKER_00]: They like nice warm temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do nice warm temperatures do to
your flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: They boil off your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we spoke about the 60, 60 versus we use
68.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still below the temperature where
terpenes tend to volatize.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you get into the high 70s,
low 80s, that's when they all really start
[SPEAKER_00]: rocking and rolling and boiling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, incubators, they're nice,
warm, cozy places.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't want to dry in there either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: An incubator would be no different than a
food dehydrator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a product specific question from a
viewer.
[SPEAKER_01]: This viewer had mentioned that they were
advised to dry in a grow tent for one day,
[SPEAKER_01]: then put into the cool cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that ideal or can people just put it
straight from harvest, straight from
[SPEAKER_01]: cuddling plant down into the cool cure?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much plant matter you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a limit to how much a cool cure
can take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are in a rather dry environment
and you can take your plant and hang it
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day or so, you're going to lose a
good chunk of water during that period,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will give you the ability to put
more into the cool cure to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much different than soaking wet towels
going into your clothes dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wring them out before you throw
them into the clothes dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help the clothes dryer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a whole lot to throw
in your clothes dryer, just toss them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to dry anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more of a technique in order to
kind of fit more product within the cool
[SPEAKER_01]: cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: To maximize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not an issue, some people,
if you get into that harvest period,
[SPEAKER_00]: want to turn it over pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that buys them some time by doing it
for a day outside before they are
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing the unit for bringing more
flower in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not in those time constraints or
volume constraints, no, just throw it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've just been harvesting and then cutting
the individual branches up, taking off the
[SPEAKER_01]: larger fan leaves, and then putting into
the actual cool cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been working out great for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger fan leaves, all they do is
adding water to remove that has no value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have heard strange things like,
Oh, should I turn the plant upside down to
[SPEAKER_00]: hang?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they were saying, it was almost
as if the sap was going to flow through
[SPEAKER_00]: the stems and wind up in the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's nothing running down the stems
into the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard so many different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the comments I get on YouTube is
just so far-fetched.
[SPEAKER_01]: One comment I remember vaguely is somebody
had mentioned that the trichomes should
[SPEAKER_01]: rupture during the drying or curing
process for a more oozy and sticky result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know if it was just a troll,
like just trying to troll and get people
[SPEAKER_01]: to like, I don't know, have a bad dry or
if they've actually thought that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some crazy ideas out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the final product coming from the cool
cure, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've dried it for four days,
you've got the four days worth of curing,
[SPEAKER_01]: eight days, and you can keep it in there
for really several months, years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've kept it in there and it's been a
great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you describe the final product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, it's fluffy, not fluffy in a light
way, more spongy and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you grind it, and we found now
instead of a grinder that shreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using these things called flour
mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consistency is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sort of has the spongy and it just lays
out nicely, smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's rare if ever someone who smokes from
flour that comes out that's properly dried
[SPEAKER_00]: and cured has that hard hacking cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just got lots of flavor, taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you can really experience all
the nuances of the flavors and smells that
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the description of what that
cultivar is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You experience it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when I remove flour from there,
the initial smell isn't anything too
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy, but then when you put it in the
grinder, it really, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: being locked in there and then unlocked
kind of as you put it through the grinder,
[SPEAKER_01]: it definitely releases a lot of flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A loud smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the terpenes that are locked in
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do get complaints that the flour
doesn't have as much smell when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, that's right, because all
the terpenes are still sealed in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break it open or grind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically the response we get is,
oh my.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think that's one of the biggest
misconceptions is like when somebody's
[SPEAKER_01]: just as they're flour in a bag,
for example, and they open, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, this stuff stinks.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, is it great that you're
smelling all that right this second?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's all volatized and it's now in
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in the flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it is nice to get that smell,
but realize that there's actually a loss
[SPEAKER_01]: happening into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: We experienced it at Big Commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go to Big Commercial, Grow,
and when you're half a block away and you
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it, you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the problem's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does the final product compare to
freeze dried?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the texture, you know,
freeze dry, you just turns to dust in your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers when you try and when you're
trying to roll with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Powder versus something that's got some
nice springy texture, sticky texture to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find freeze dried to be harsh compared
to, you know, something that's dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured with a cool cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are looking at weight when you
freeze dry, you're getting rid of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: water, all your weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in the business, it's not a
good bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a big difference between
the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got my hands on some free
freeze dried product last week and for the
[SPEAKER_01]: first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great in bowls and bongs,
but when you're rolling it and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in a joint or a blunt,
it's like not anywhere good as just stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been in the cannabis roll,
for example, or, or dried in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, big difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when people say that is freeze drying
is the future, I can't agree with that
[SPEAKER_01]: because I feel like it's not good for all
of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: All methods of consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: There, there are great applications for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe smokable flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that reminds me,
I wanted to touch upon is the actual final
[SPEAKER_01]: product you mentioned before, but I forgot
to mention it is when you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: fluffy, I just want to clarify that it's
not airy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the buds aren't always airy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of folks go after density and
the density is definitely still
[SPEAKER_01]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to clarify that in case
anybody, anybody took that the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the fluffy has to do when you
squeeze it, it springs back a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: versus crumbling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The freeze dried stuff just, just crumbles
right up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about the future of the cool
cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any new features coming out and
the future for that at this time?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, since a lot of it is basic
physics, um, you know, we're just working
[SPEAKER_00]: on basic physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this, you know, technically there's not
a whole lot we can do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and as far as things in the future,
we're always pondering it, but nothing at
[SPEAKER_00]: this time, you know, to, uh, to talk
about.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got to ask, cause it is one of
the biggest complaints, the price is many
[SPEAKER_01]: claim that the price is too high where
there'll be a price drop at any point in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's none that we anticipate,
you know, we've cut out what we can part,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we've discussed early,
we're buying, an insulated box with a door
[SPEAKER_00]: that was destined to be a wine cooler to
get the price as low as possible for that
[SPEAKER_00]: component.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then the rest of it is the
electronics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it's built all here in
Vermont, in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an amazing staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they get paid vacations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a 401k.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got health insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and they cost money to treat people
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we believe in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, yeah, could we go and,
uh, have this whole thing made in China?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, people who are, you know, barely
scraping by for labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what we believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do want to support
American manufacturing, American assembly
[SPEAKER_01]: and buy America.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes that does result in the
price being a little bit higher,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, uh, you're paying for the workforce,
you know, you're really employing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a bigger picture there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that we're firm believers in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would just, just listed as one of
the best, uh, businesses, companies to
[SPEAKER_00]: work for in the state of Vermont.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's, uh, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered quite a bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you wanted to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, any information we are at
canatrolls.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we've got an Instagram page,
um, good social media following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, well, Chris is great resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has one.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can tell you all about it, but yeah,
definitely any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can even pick up the phone and call us
at our phone number, uh, 802-738-0709 or
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of resources, information,
case studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there's nothing here we're hiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to make things easy for the folks
tuning in on YouTube, I'll definitely have
[SPEAKER_01]: a link to the website down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I have as a pinned comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well for easy reference so you can
easily click over to that website and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out the products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, David, thank you so much for coming
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of valuable input
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help out the audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really appreciate you coming on and
spending the time here to sit down and
[SPEAKER_01]: talk shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we can get you on in the future
and do a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody has questions on the product or
just trying and carrying in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is enough questions, maybe we can
get David on for a part two and just go
[SPEAKER_01]: through a kind of Q and a on, uh,
on drawing and curing love too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
