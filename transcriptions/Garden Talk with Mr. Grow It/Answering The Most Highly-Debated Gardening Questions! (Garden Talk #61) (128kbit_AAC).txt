[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's enough calcium inside your tap
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's enough of the basic nutrients you
need to sustain your seedling stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: to sustain early veg, especially when
you're in that living soil or no-till soil
[SPEAKER_02]: setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: My grows are a lot better since I went
from a synthetic grow to an organic grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The chlorine debate on, oh, that's killing
organics, I believe is a little bit over
[SPEAKER_02]: the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's nearly something that
we need to worry about as much as what
[SPEAKER_02]: other things out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only time you pretty much need an
RO filter right away, is when you're maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before topping, try to bend, and if you
can't successfully bend the top lower than
[SPEAKER_02]: the medium nodes, then you might have to
look into topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting better color now, I'm getting
better bud density now, and I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: better overall terpenes than I ever had
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 61.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Derek from the
Bud Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may recognize him from Twitch,
where he hosts a 24-7 plant community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually on his channel a few weeks
back, and he asked me a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial questions on highly debated
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I figured I'd flip the
switch and ask him a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial questions on highly debated
topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you supporting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big supporter of this podcast is AC
Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sponsor this podcast, and I use their
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity now has gardening tools and
accessories, such as heavy-duty fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: grow pots, trimmers, grow room glasses,
drying racks, plant ties, and trellis
[SPEAKER_00]: nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have all of the equipment needed
for a ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to AC Infinity down in
the description section below,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can use discount code MRGROWIT
during checkout for a discount on their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Spider Farmer for sponsoring
this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer has recently redesigned
their SF series LED grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the old version, the Samsung diodes are
close together, resulting in the light
[SPEAKER_00]: being more focused towards the center of
the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the new version, the Samsung diodes are
spaced out, resulting in a better light
[SPEAKER_00]: spread across the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to a Spider Farmer
website and their Amazon store down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below, and you can use
discount code MRGROWIT5 during checkout
[SPEAKER_00]: for a discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla has one of the best double-ended
grow lights on the market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DE Pro Series grow light has the
capability to run both HPS and CMH bulbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get a 50% longer bulb life and a
fixture that runs cooler due to their
[SPEAKER_00]: engineered heat sink and thermals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on top of that, you can dial it all in
with the optional DE Pro Series
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm joined with Derek from the Bud
Lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a little chat over on your channel,
your Twitch channel, and then I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize you had a YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden, like weeks
later, that video pops up on where Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: amended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wait a minute, he's got YouTube
too?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was just Twitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I literally, it's just my Twitch
highlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do any editing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a straight whatever's on Twitch
goes right to the YouTube just to save it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought we were just going to be alive
and all of a sudden we're on YouTube too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shocker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we had a great conversation on
your channel and thanks again for having
[SPEAKER_00]: me on your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about a lot of controversial
topics and I wanted to kind of flip the
[SPEAKER_00]: script and ask you some of those
controversial topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this channel, because I feel like that
talk went pretty, pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of opinion based things,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are talking from experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither of us are scientists, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're no experts in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're wannabes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's have a friendly conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love for the folks that are
tuning in, listening to this to chime in
[SPEAKER_00]: on the comment section as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a comment section on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know what you think about someone
things that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Highly debatable topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, let's just let's just get into
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, actually, let's do
introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Derek.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run a 24 seven community on Twitch
called the Bud Lab 24 seven as in
[SPEAKER_02]: literally we don't ever go offline.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been live for over three years
straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just a little community on Twitch
and loving every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been gardening for over four years
now, I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an adventure every single day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait to see what the next four
years are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say your overall style
of gardening is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, indoor, outdoor, soil,
cocoa, hydro, organic, synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_02]: My style, I would say, would be mainly
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I'm like a blend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Between each stage of growing,
I change kind of what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm in more of the veg stage,
I might be more of a synthetic grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm in the flowering stage,
I might be more of an organic grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to almost base it per room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my flowering room, I would say would be
in my eyes would be 99.9% organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have I do have some outdoor plants
that I grow once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of like the cutting flowers,
like dahlias.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a couple gardens for veggies,
but not too too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mostly focus on the other plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have experience with both
synthetics and organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on organics having
a better terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's true or do you think that
might not be true?
[SPEAKER_02]: Coming off of personal experience,
I would personally say my grows are a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: better since I went from a synthetic grow
to organic grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my rosin is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my overall flower looks better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my colors of the flower looks
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it just overall looks better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never gone and actually got any of my
stuff tested for the values of terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to and to get an actual
comparison side by side but everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've done in my personal experience,
I truly believe that organics is the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now about mixing organics and synthetics,
some people will do that throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start off with organics,
maybe like a premixed soil to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then maybe they'll top dress some organics
and maybe they'll, when they start seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies or whatever, they'll add in
some synthetics, that fast boosting
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any objections to mixing
organics and synthetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it should be done or it
shouldn't be done or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's if you know what products
you're using and you know that there's not
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be any nutrient fallout or any
nutrient conflict or maybe killing off
[SPEAKER_02]: your microbes in your living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are confident in the product that
you're using or your synthetic product
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're using that's not going to do
that, then yeah, I'd say it would be safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely use, I have a synthetic
CalMag for if I do need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely have different products and
calps and stuff like that that I will use
[SPEAKER_02]: if I need it, a calp liquid spray or
something like that, which I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: consider 100% organic when it's mixed with
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really pick the products that
you can find that aren't going to cause a
[SPEAKER_02]: conflict with what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some really good success doing
synthetics, mixing the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, starting out with the premixed soil
and then adding synthetic nutrients after
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact for the rest of the grow,
particularly in flour and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten some great results doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have anything against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you're going to have a poor
final result in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's people who think that the
first time they feed in those synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, they're wiping out their
microbial life that's in the medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the chlorine debate as well where
people are like, don't use tap water for
[SPEAKER_02]: it guys because that little bit of
chlorine is going to kill your microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need a little bit more than
just what's in our tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chlorine, chloramine, that's often said to
kill off microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think that's the case?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it does kill off microbes,
but I think the amount that are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: water, the amount that people are worrying
about, I don't think is the amount that we
[SPEAKER_02]: need to worry about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are just using, say, and there is
cheaper products out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can use KDF filters, RV filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do two stage filters.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can let your water sit for 12 hours to
evaporate a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the chlorine debate on,
oh, that's killing organics, I believe is
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit over the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's nearly something that
we need to worry about as much as what
[SPEAKER_02]: other things out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of people that have their
hose hooked up directly to their gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even your irrigation system is watering
your lawn or your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That all has chlorine in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that to say that's completely wiping
out your micro population, I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: false.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also drinking it as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We drink chlorine in our water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have beneficial bacteria and stuff
in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it humans and plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to say they're the same,
but we do have to follow similar lines of
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium is obviously important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff like that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big debate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drinking water with chlorine in
it, that you're wiping out the microbes in
[SPEAKER_00]: your gut biome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and using chlorine in septic tanks,
you're supposed to be using pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: the same microbes we add into our pots and
into our living soils.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pretty much adding to our septic
tanks to create the same bacteria in both
[SPEAKER_02]: senses to remove the negative bacteria and
only have your positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have experience with
that, but you hear about people drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually spent years drinking RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got so much crap in the comment section
when I said that because apparently there
[SPEAKER_00]: are studies out there that say that it's
robbing nutrients from your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bound to anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just straight H2O.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're drinking it, it's binding to
those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's depleting from your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say the same thing with
plants, that you shouldn't be using RO
[SPEAKER_00]: water into your medium because it's
potentially robbing the plant of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who watches me knows me and RO is a
little bit of a touchy subject because I
[SPEAKER_02]: truly believe there's other methods before
getting an RO machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the RO filters are the last thing
we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only time you pretty much need an RO
filter right away is when you're maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: making concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: In growing, there's so many other things
that we can use to remove a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: things that RO water they think is the
number one thing that we all need.
[SPEAKER_02]: People go out and get RO machines because
they don't want calcium spots from the
[SPEAKER_02]: humidifiers anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can literally buy little tablets that
go inside your humidifier that remove that
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just called a demineralizer,
I think they're called.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy those.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really need to put RO inside
your humidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can buy those.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a lot cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: RO water wastes more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the time, it wastes more water
than usable water.
[SPEAKER_02]: In places where water is very limited or
water is very valuable, which it really
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you're draining.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're throwing it all down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of options out there
that we should be looking at before we
[SPEAKER_02]: look at RO.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a good documentary online
about the drinking of mineral water.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you were saying, they're saying that
it is healthier for you to drink higher
[SPEAKER_02]: PPM water, your higher EC, higher TDS,
to give you these minerals and stuff in
[SPEAKER_02]: your body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not safe, like what you said,
or I shouldn't say not safe, but it isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: recommended to drink RO water because,
like exactly what you said, it is pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: away from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said that with growing before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've said that I think if you are using RO
water to water seedlings, or for your veg,
[SPEAKER_02]: or to do this and that, most tap water is
all right, unless you're in a well,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're in a place where the tap water
is not even safe to drink.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're at a point where it's not even
safe to drink, then yeah, it's probably
[SPEAKER_02]: not safe for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's within that 200, maybe up to that
300 PPM, in my opinion, it seems to be
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty safe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's safe for going through veg,
going through seedling stage, and going
[SPEAKER_02]: through my flower, at least in my setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't aware of the tablets that you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to look those up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize they had those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do run RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cringe for you probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not cringe if you reuse the
wastewater, hook it up to your toilet,
[SPEAKER_02]: put it inside a reservoir, and maybe use
it outside or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what I was just about to say is
that Doggo the Hutt, he was on one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episodes before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had mentioned that his drain line,
that line that the wasted water is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to, he's put it into a bucket and then
using it on his plants outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being used.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not wasting that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it for every gallon?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's draining out three gallons or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from one to one all the way up to one
to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's depending on what your base water
going in and what you want coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are chasing for that zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a one to one and come out with
a 10, rather than a zero, come out with a
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 PPM, which in my opinion is even better
because you can't use pH pens in RO water.
[SPEAKER_02]: It breaks your pH pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many people do it and then they come
back, why is my Blue Labs pH pen all
[SPEAKER_02]: uncalibrated?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, it's because the RO water,
and it says right in the manual,
[SPEAKER_02]: it cannot be used in RO water.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always recommend put a little bit of
Cal Mag in your RO water before using the
[SPEAKER_02]: pH, but if you already start with a 10,
not the zero, you have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: minerals in there for the ion exchange in
your pH meter and it works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't cause any problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of these RO systems aren't actually
stripping it down to zero PPM anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some that went down to 20 PPM,
40 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think eight PPM is what I measured
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know exactly what you mean though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even with PPM meters, it's not going to
read it properly, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a starting base water of 150 and
at 150, I think it is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like seedling stage at 150, you don't need
to add any nutrients to it because you
[SPEAKER_02]: have, there's enough calcium inside your
tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's enough of the basic nutrients you
need to sustain your seedling stage,
[SPEAKER_02]: to sustain early veg, especially when
you're in that living soil or no till soil
[SPEAKER_02]: setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be feeding no nutrients and just
living off that living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: For months, weeks, just by using tap
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had that low of PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: My PPM on my tap water comes out at 485.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the 500.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the last limit at least here
for safe drinking water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with the stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm right on the edge there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right on the edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe that's why you got another RO
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can always, and I haven't done this
yet, is send out this water sample to get
[SPEAKER_00]: a water sample report.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can actually see what's in the
water and then actually you can formulate
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients around that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about potentially having a
lot of calcium in the tap water already,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium or whatever else is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I'm going to need to use as
much CalMag, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think people who are using,
like in my opinion, if you are using a
[SPEAKER_02]: media where it is, you do have to add more
calcium, like cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: For an example, tap water is actually a
savior almost because you're not having to
[SPEAKER_02]: add all that calcium because you're
already giving it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know with cocoa, you might have to
still add more, but you're not starting
[SPEAKER_02]: with a zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're starting with a little bit of a
base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, okay, am I way off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I not?
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of tap water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a fan of RO water, but I think you
need to be respectful of the RO water and
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to figure out what you're going
to, what are you using it for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using it only for humidifiers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's other options.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using it for an array of things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then yeah, obviously it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have experience growing auto
flowers at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, type R in chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand with that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time we talk about an auto flower,
I yell type R in chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And type R is just, I don't know if I'm
saying this right, but Ruderalis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is your ditch plant, quote unquote
ditch.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we say type R.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime we say auto flower,
type R in chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So comments, type R in chat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have grown a couple auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about the light cycle
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are saying that you should
give a period of darkness for the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, I truly believe that every
plant needs to have a sleeping cycle just
[SPEAKER_02]: because an auto flower doesn't grow by a
time schedule or a light schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has its sleeping times.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has its time where you can watch
the plant that at 18 hours you can start
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing those leaves start to droop down
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, in my opinion,
that's when I will turn the lights off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already reached its DLI for that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's able to sustain itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to run it to 24.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the extra six or the extra four
hours between that 20 or 24 hour,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think is just money coming out of your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not really giving you the bonus
you're really looking for, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the best light cycle for auto
flowers is 18.6.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've run them on 12.12.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally think you get a decrease
in yield and quality if you're not giving
[SPEAKER_02]: it the appropriate amount of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have an underpowered LED,
it's probably better for you to go with an
[SPEAKER_02]: auto flower at 18 hours a day because you
can reach your DLI and you can get dense
[SPEAKER_02]: buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing photo periods and you
don't have the best light, it's hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: get your full DLI in the 12 hour time
period, just like an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's easier in a more budget friendly
setup to get that with the auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying auto flowers the next best
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a place where we can finally
kind of regulate everything a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we can finally stabilize things a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen that over the last couple
of years with auto flowers that it has
[SPEAKER_02]: stabilized a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I truly back to the light
question, I truly think that 18.6 is the
[SPEAKER_02]: light cycle for auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it should be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if you reduce the light to extend so
the DLI is achieved at the 24 hour mark?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're lowering your overall... Yeah,
so you still get DLI within the 24 hours
[SPEAKER_00]: instead of 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing it that way then,
then it's all, in my opinion, now it's all
[SPEAKER_02]: about light coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you have to focus because right now
to get it to low enough PAR or low enough
[SPEAKER_02]: wattage and PAR, which usually equals very
similar when you're looking at light
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers, if you're trying to get very
similar numbers to give you that DLI for
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole thing, you're either going to
have to use a low wattage light with high,
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of coverage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're still getting those dense plants
over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for an example, if you're in a two
by four tan and you've got 100 watt light,
[SPEAKER_02]: that 100 watt light, the normal 100 watt
lights are little tiny cubies,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more of a square.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not filling out that whole two by
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even if you have 24 hours of light,
you might not be getting the full coverage
[SPEAKER_02]: of the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only maybe one branch of that plant might
be getting its perfect PAR or DLI for the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you start getting down to it,
lowering your wattage to increase your
[SPEAKER_02]: lights time on to give you the same PAR,
you're now looking at getting a larger
[SPEAKER_02]: light to be able to cover that whole area,
to be able to grow your plants closer,
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to get that PAR.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that same 24 hours, and it's a lot
harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just easier just to go down
to 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about transplanting autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you for that or against it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people swear and say you should never
transplant autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, no, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm for it if you transplant smart.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you let the seedling or the plant
fill out the first pot before transplant a
[SPEAKER_02]: second, and I'm not saying make sure it's
root bound.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying make sure that when you do
remove it from the pot, you're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the whole entire soil plug is
just falling apart and just dusting out,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure that you can pull
out the plant and it's holding the media
[SPEAKER_02]: to it itself so that when you transplant
into the new pot using your mycorrhizae,
[SPEAKER_02]: using all that, you're forcing the roots
to spread out into the new soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that is perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think if you're early transplanting
or you're late transplanting, then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a problem 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and then topping autoflowers is
another hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say you shouldn't do any type
of high stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So topping, cutting off the top of a
plant, for example, so it creates two
[SPEAKER_00]: branches coming out instead of just that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you for or against topping
autoflowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I think with topping,
it's really based on genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it's autoflower or
photo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's extremely important for
genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants you top and they're not going
to give you what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next two nodes below don't stretch
like you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that one that you just topped off
would have been better to bend it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always try to say that before
topping, try to bend.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can't successfully bend the top
lower than the lowest or the medium nodes,
[SPEAKER_02]: then you might have to look into topping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always suggest with topping to clone
that top.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously with autoflowers,
you don't really have the way to clone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more of a monster crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you are realistically just cutting that
off and you're either wasting it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going in the garbage, or you are
bending it down to try and achieve that
[SPEAKER_02]: larger cola in other places, not just the
top, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rather than growing like a Christmas tree,
bend it down, allow that main cola to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: over here and allow all these other spurts
to shoot up here, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cloning autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's dig a little deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually a guy, I don't know if
you've ever heard of him, Bill Ward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know who he is?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard of him, yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So apparently he's been cloning
autoflowers and he's been getting like
[SPEAKER_00]: four plus ounces per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it cloning?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I haven't looked into the whole
method, but I have heard of people
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully cloning autoflowers,
but what I've heard they're doing is
[SPEAKER_02]: they're reverting the autoflower back to a
photo period trait before cloning it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if it's essentially
cloning an autoflower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how he does it, but I've
heard they've done is they've stressed out
[SPEAKER_02]: an autoflower or they've grown out an
autoflower and they've gone through or
[SPEAKER_02]: tried to go through a revege and it can
stress it out so much that it almost
[SPEAKER_02]: brings the photo traits back out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've called them and what a
couple of breeders have called them is
[SPEAKER_02]: called, they've called them super autos
where they might start to veg seven,
[SPEAKER_02]: eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's more or less like, and I've seen
them, like I've got a couple of breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've talked with that are trying to
grow these super autos where they veg out
[SPEAKER_02]: for like eight, nine weeks, become a huge
autoflower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kind of grow like more like a
photo period, but they have the autoflower
[SPEAKER_02]: traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how the whole autoflower
cloning works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's more of a revege scenario or
maybe like stressing it to bring out
[SPEAKER_02]: another trait, because I have seen other
guys on YouTube say they've successfully
[SPEAKER_02]: transplanted autoflowers, but it always
seems like there's a revege involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there's a revege involved,
it usually means it's gone back some type
[SPEAKER_02]: of traits.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know too much about that,
but from everything that I've kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: learned through being in this seat is
that's kind of what I've seen,
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you clone an autoflower,
it's more of a monster crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like you're cutting all
these branches off, cloning them out,
[SPEAKER_02]: more or less doing a sea of green style
and hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're reverting that original plant
back to like its photo style.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can through back breeding or back
crossing or however that all works and
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to reclone it through that method,
I think are the two that are going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I could have butchered that,
but that's how I understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I haven't watched Bill's videos,
but it was like a recent Garden Talk
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode with somebody mentioning
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned that it's pointless to
clone autos because once you clone it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to start to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in the same time cycle,
so you're really not going to get much of
[SPEAKER_00]: a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually clone it or root,
but you won't get much of a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the comment section was just
flooded with people mentioning Bill Ward
[SPEAKER_00]: and what he's doing over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to go over there still and check
it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to learn more about it and
learn more about the whole breeding side
[SPEAKER_02]: of it because I do think that we haven't
even touched base on a lot of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's going to be other ways of
doing breeding and other ways of maybe,
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate using this term, manipulating or
mutating the plants in different methods
[SPEAKER_02]: to maybe come out with another freak show
or whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw your last video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it looking awesome?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: If more traits like that can be brought
out in the future doing different various
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking beyond auto flowers, leaf
stripping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So defoliation, some people call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people swear that you shouldn't leaf
strip at all in flower in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people do agree that
some sort of leaf stripping or some people
[SPEAKER_00]: consider lollipopping where you're
removing the lower third or lower quarter
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bud develop can focus on the top
part of the plant doing defoliation to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liking penetrate down into the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also going into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people who are adamant that you
should be leaf stripping in flower during
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the prime weeks of bud production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually helps with bud production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do a leaf stripping trimming from day
one of flower all the way until day 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might push it until day 25, day 26,
whatever I pretty much try to schedule it
[SPEAKER_02]: and where I can schedule it with my life,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think the beginning of flower,
I believe it's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very important to trim and to get rid
of those lowers because most of us aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: focusing on light penetration and pushing
the light as low as possible, spreading
[SPEAKER_02]: out our plants as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of us are focusing on trying to get
the best yield and the best best quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not focusing on the inside
branches and all of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how I always have done it and how I try
to push and try to show my stream is from
[SPEAKER_02]: day one all the way until day 21.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pretty much do every other day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm taking a handful of leaves off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like what you said, lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm starting from the bottom, moving my
way all the way up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by day 21, I pretty much have a fully
lollipop plant or all of my plants are
[SPEAKER_02]: fully lollipop and everything that's below
either your net or everything that's
[SPEAKER_02]: below, the farthest your light can travel
has been removed because your leaves are
[SPEAKER_02]: your solar panels.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not getting any light,
they're not doing anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just sitting there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're just a home for bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a home for the bottom canopy,
the bottom canopy icky stuff that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been trying out different
trimming methods of trimming from day one
[SPEAKER_02]: all the way to day 21 and then not doing
anything until day 42 in flower like what
[SPEAKER_02]: you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: End of flower cycle trim to try and either
open up the remaining bud sites that are
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of a little bit lower on everything
that's now grown out and everything
[SPEAKER_02]: because everything's now just exploded.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're trying to open up some of
these lower bud sites for the last two,
[SPEAKER_02]: three weeks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't want that bud in the
middle that's all squished together and
[SPEAKER_02]: all, or that flower in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want any of that because it's
just not what you're looking for or it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just remove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about taking off handfuls of
leaves from day 21 to 21 each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often hear that- Every two days,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two days, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often hear about people saying that if
you're doing too much training,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much defoliation, it could stress out
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the point it becomes a hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you come across that at all or do you
not believe in that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that, again, I think it's based
on genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are growing a bag seed,
if you are growing something that you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really know where it's coming from,
yeah, you might want to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're growing something that you
have grown for a while now, that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it's stable, that you know you can push it
a little bit, I don't really see anything
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only hermia I've ever had is when I
ran a green light beside one of my cameras
[SPEAKER_02]: in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tested IR lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tested a ton of different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only hermia I've ever had was from
that green light.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trimming, I think maybe the biggest
negative to over trimming and trimming up
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of the bottoms would be that if your
plants aren't as healthy as they could be
[SPEAKER_02]: or can be and your room's not as clean as
it should be, it's definitely more
[SPEAKER_02]: susceptible to bringing in things into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you have molds or if you have
bacteria or something in your garden,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're cutting up all these plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're leaving an exposed source for these
things to travel right into your plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like bud rot, all these different things
can happen if you're over cutting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why they try to tell you not to
trim outdoor plants very much,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the more cuts that you have on
these outdoor, the more things that things
[SPEAKER_02]: can get into that plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about green light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to circle back to that because they
sell those green headlamps and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh, go into your grow, just turn on
the green light, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants not going to have any issues with
that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You found the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you actually had plants turn
hermaphrodite from the green light,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was actually crazy because what I
did is I wanted to display the trichomes
[SPEAKER_02]: forming on a plant in real time for
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on my live stream, I put a camera right
up to it and I put a green light right
[SPEAKER_02]: above it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the green light is because the camera
I was using didn't have any IR for night.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used the green light at it was a one
watt smart LED and I had it dimmed to 2%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't even really see the green on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so low.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that could see it was the
camera and only one branch on the whole
[SPEAKER_02]: entire plant hermied and it was the branch
that I was trying to macro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the only one and it's the strain
I've nice continue to grow today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've cloned off of that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't rehermied.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my best plants and I've never
had any problems with it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only thing I can say that it was
from was from that green light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have seen the green lights that people
put on their headlamps or on their head
[SPEAKER_02]: and they go in their garden to snap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they work if you're going in there
for like five minutes, 10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then at that point is five minutes of
light on or if you opening the door for
[SPEAKER_02]: five minutes and taking a couple pictures
really doing harm then to get that green
[SPEAKER_02]: light and go in there and make sure that
you're inspect your gadget with the green
[SPEAKER_02]: light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good little experiment that you chose to
do and that was a result you got from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at the very beginning of my
stream three years ago, all of the
[SPEAKER_02]: nighttime photos and nighttime footage was
all green.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's all gray because I've upgraded to
IR because IR doesn't cause certain
[SPEAKER_02]: wavelengths of IR doesn't cause any
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the wavelengths of IR in security
cameras or most security cameras I should
[SPEAKER_02]: say is good for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't say all plants because I
have tested my greenhouse and I've tested
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the outdoor cutting flowers and I
have noticed that some of them that are
[SPEAKER_02]: near the IR at night are growing four
times bigger than the ones that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: growing near the IR at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't seem to have any effect on
my indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only has effect on like I think we
noticed it with the gladioluses last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a very beautiful cutting flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of looks like a Christmas tree,
very, very tall, like a lupine almost if
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone knows what a lupine is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectrum manipulation that was on the list
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else in regards to spectrum that
you think are maybe controversial that we
[SPEAKER_00]: missed there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we touched upon IR and green light
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: UV, UV stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking into a little bit of UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to learn a little bit of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now or two years ago all these LED
companies were coming out with these UV
[SPEAKER_02]: diodes on their HLGs or on their Samsungs
or whatever the heck lights people are
[SPEAKER_02]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're trying to sell this UV LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of the research that I could do on
is that these UV LEDs were at a third or
[SPEAKER_02]: an eighth of the lifespan of your full
spectrum diode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're buying this LED that these UVs
are only going to work for maybe one or
[SPEAKER_02]: two grows and then they're going to die
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you have this light that now
you're supposed to have UV, but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have UV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think two years ago they started
changing into different bulb style lights
[SPEAKER_02]: because they started realizing UVA and UVB
work better in bulbs rather than LEDs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They seem to not have the technology for
LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are coming out with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely coming out with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for growing right now it seems like
the best UVBs you can get are in still
[SPEAKER_02]: fluorescent bulb styles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the ones that seem the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are now testing UVB in flower
cycles to try and increase the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: percentages for concentrates or and try
and increase the overall trichome resin
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage so they can get more return on
their concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are trying with like turning on UVB
or UV light two hours a day in mid flower
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle or turning it on at two hours at the
end of your flower cycle or turning off
[SPEAKER_02]: all your flower lights and then turning
the UV on just for an hour and then
[SPEAKER_02]: turning back on your flower lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to how people are using IR 15
minutes before turning lights on and 15
[SPEAKER_02]: minutes after turning lights off to try
and send your plant to sleep faster and to
[SPEAKER_02]: wake up your plant faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are testing all these different
theories of different wavelengths and this
[SPEAKER_02]: and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's all trying to manipulate the
Sun as best as we can or try and figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out what we can do better than the Sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant grows awesome under the Sun but
what can we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What spectrum can we add?
[SPEAKER_02]: What wavelengths can we add?
[SPEAKER_02]: What can we do extra that can make it even
better?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean you said it pretty well
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Sun is kind of limited to that one
spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like we have the ability to change
the spectrum and change the morphology of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a ton of studies going on
in regards to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's something that's gonna be
happening for the next five, ten plus
[SPEAKER_00]: years seeing what the spectrum does for
the morphology of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to see what outcomes in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well it was crazy too because four years
ago, three years ago, if you wanted a
[SPEAKER_02]: flower dedicated light, you were getting a
light that was around 3,000 Kelvins,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is more of a red spectrum,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: More on the red, more on that yellowy red
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not so much blue, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you would use the blue spectrums
for your veg, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're starting to realize that
that's not really what we're trying to do
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You see a lot of these flower lights that
are coming out now that are at 45,
[SPEAKER_02]: 4,500 Kelvins or they're at 5,000 Kelvins
trying to push as much blue light as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible on those flower and they're
offsetting it with IR in red now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're saying, okay, let's maximize
the blue spectrum as much as possible
[SPEAKER_02]: because we know blue counts for leaf
growth, the node spacing, this and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now let's throw it with some IR.
[SPEAKER_02]: IR does very similar to blue, but now on
the red spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can also create bud density.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now because now we have IR and now we
have blue, now we're getting way too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're almost getting too much stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost an offset now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we add a little bit of red just to
create that perfect balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with the lights that I use in flower,
they're 5,300 Kelvins.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four years ago, people would be like,
why are you flowering with veg lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, I'm getting better color
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting better bud density now and I'm
getting better overall terpenes than I
[SPEAKER_02]: ever had before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to see that shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went on my Instagram and I did
a story and asking people for these
[SPEAKER_00]: controversial topics for this particular
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So shout out to those folks that mentioned
flushing as one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was on my initial list, but there was
a ton of people that want to know your
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts on flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think about flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your thoughts?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the term flushing is thrown around with
way too many definitions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of the definitions that
are being thrown around are a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: out of, out of the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are make sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them make perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I think, when I think of the term
flushing, I immediately think of revival
[SPEAKER_02]: almost any time I need to flush something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means my plant is in an oopsie state
and I need to fix it is the way I look at
[SPEAKER_02]: flushing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am trying to remove a buildup in the
soil so that my plant isn't uptaking that
[SPEAKER_02]: overabundance of nutrients that's in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not removing the nutrients from the
plant physically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am allowing the plant to eat what's
already being uptake and what's already
[SPEAKER_02]: inside its system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm removing it from the soil because
the way I look at is that your soil life
[SPEAKER_02]: is the most important thing in my grow,
is that if my soil is healthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: my plants are healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no way from everything that I've
learned and everything that I've done,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is no physical way that you can
remove what's already in your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're at week nine and your plant
is obvious signs of way too much nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_02]: you've got the curling leaves,
you've got, it's so green that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: like see yourself in it because it's
peering back at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're saying, oh, I'm just going to
throw 10 liters of water in it right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and harvest it in a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're saying, oh, that's going to
remove all those nutrients that's in that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to give me a better smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just need to get that out of our
brain because that's not happening and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way what flushing is, is that we are
adding water to whatever we need to do to
[SPEAKER_02]: revive it, to repair it, to start it over
is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, how I grow, because I grow with top
dressing and my last top dress in flower
[SPEAKER_02]: is at six weeks of flower, I don't feed
anything except for water the last three
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of people look at me and say,
oh, you're flushing anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I top dress, it's slow release,
meaning I top dress six weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning takes a week to start to slow
release.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by week seven, it starts to slow
release into the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the plant's uptaking it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by week, all week eight, it's getting
full nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then by the time week nine,
week 10, when I harvest, it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: ate up all the nutrients in its soil to
the point where it's now where I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: start adding it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's depleted all the nutrients and
that's when I harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it's depleted, all the nutrients
in the soil, not me trying to force the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients out of the plant because that
just doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is a daily topic on TBL.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think just the term I think is just not
used correctly because I just think people
[SPEAKER_02]: are thinking it's it's physically removing
it out of the plant, which is not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if we just change the term of
flushing to revive or final step or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, I think it would make
a lot more sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then going into the flushing products,
there's a lot of products out there that
[SPEAKER_02]: are literally advertising this flushing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put it at the end of your grow because
it'll do this and this and this and this
[SPEAKER_02]: and this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're thinking, OK, how is this
working?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at a lot of these
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're they're they're humic,
they're fulvic acid based or they're
[SPEAKER_02]: magnesium based.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all that stuff does is it breaks down
what's already in your soil and it allows
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant to uptake it or it allows you
to get it out of the soil faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's all that stuff does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not doing anything to help break down
your plants nutrients in the in the cell
[SPEAKER_02]: walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this and that it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just hoping that the term flushing
changes to the point where people are
[SPEAKER_02]: realizing flushing doesn't create white
ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: White ash doesn't mean quality smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: High resinous plants will produce more of
a black ash than a white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't mean it's a lower quality
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means it's full of resin, which is
perfect for extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that makes any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been studies that that back up
what you say as far as it doesn't change
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrient content in the actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been leaf tissue tests done on
flushed versus unflushed plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they didn't show a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if you're flushing your
plants at the end of the grow or stopping
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients at the end of the grow for a
week or two weeks, there was no difference
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you mentioned for organics,
you're feeding on week six or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have that slow release and the
plant is basically fed all the way up
[SPEAKER_00]: until you chop it down and harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned you also grow
synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you feeding synthetics all the way up
until harvest or are you stopping feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: at a certain point, like a week before or
two weeks before?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant will start to senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll start to get a fade happen before
harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fade happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm using synthetics all the way
through, before I went to what I'm using
[SPEAKER_02]: now, I was using more of I think it was
called a veganic mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was like it was organic to the point
where they couldn't add the vegan
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they add a synthetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Variable to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I used to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the guys who watch me can
still use the same stuff and they are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing some of the nicest, nicest plants
I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them don't flush at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: They push it right to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think not feeding the last week,
I think is smart because I do think you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want to harvest at a completely
green plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it makes sense to harvest a plant
that has a natural fade to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it just makes perfect sense too
because when the plant is naturally
[SPEAKER_02]: fading, it means it is putting itself in
the final life stretch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means it is trying to push out more
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The trichomes on the plant, the resin on
the plant, its defensive structures or its
[SPEAKER_02]: defensive mechanism so that when it is
fading, the plant is signaling itself that
[SPEAKER_02]: this is my end.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my end.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to reproduce to either get myself
going, which is why I would pump out more
[SPEAKER_02]: resin to try and get pollen stuck to me,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we pump out more resin because that's
the stuff that we want, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So in turn, that any time I look at a fade
in a plant, that means, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: that means that plant is stressed or that
means that plant is ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when the plant is ready to go,
that means in my eyes, it's already in its
[SPEAKER_02]: final stage of pushing out those
trichomes, pushing out those colors,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing whatever you need to, to try and get
the best possible plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: In direct relation to that, ice flushing,
another thing that people do in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: stress their plant at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, what are your thoughts
on ice flushing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's like an old, old method maybe
that it's not the roots that you're trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to freeze more or less to bring out the
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the color is associated with just
the cold temperatures on the plant itself,
[SPEAKER_02]: not so much the roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way I look at it, a lot of people
have added the ice to the flushing to try
[SPEAKER_02]: and stress it out, to try and bring it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: To bring out these cooler colors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, stressing any type of stress at the end
I think is going to be a positive,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I also think there's some that don't
really work and there's some that do work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people who are stacking all these
different things, like doing the ice flush
[SPEAKER_02]: during a 48 hour darkness, during a full
in pot drying cycle or something like
[SPEAKER_02]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I think stacking all these things to
try and increase the stress, to try and
[SPEAKER_02]: get a better product I think is maybe
doing a little bit too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you want to try and bring out
colors or try and stress it to bring out
[SPEAKER_02]: colors, it's better for you just to put an
AC or something in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if the ice bath personally is
going to really do what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now how about the old stem splitting
technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I have people sticking like pencils
and stuff through the actual stock and
[SPEAKER_02]: sticking like Lego man through the stock
to try and increase the stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't grow big enough plants inside to
split my stocks like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm growing a plant outside where my
stock is big enough to split like that,
[SPEAKER_02]: I would be worried for bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the number one thing that you get
outside around here is bud rot in your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and it goes through like broken,
like if you break a branch, it'll climb
[SPEAKER_02]: right through there and it'll affect that
whole branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't really try to do too much of
any type of breaking, cutting or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: on my outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: On indoor, like I said, the where I grow
everything is so short that it's just not
[SPEAKER_02]: something I really looked into.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's an old technique just like the
ice flush that I think there's other
[SPEAKER_02]: methods now that probably do the exact
same thing without having to drill a hole
[SPEAKER_02]: through the side of your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, last one, bud washing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've harvested your plants and you've
gotten to the point where you wash your
[SPEAKER_00]: buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you a bud washer or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: So bud washing, I always suggest for
everybody to do bud washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I have a lot of guys now who wash
all of their bud, their indoor and their
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something because dust, for an
example, some organic nutrients is a
[SPEAKER_02]: powder.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally a powder and most of that
powder is ground up bone, ground up
[SPEAKER_02]: manure, like ground up things that are
blowing everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And washing bud, if you're doing it
correctly and you're doing it where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: washing it and then putting it into a
controlled space so you are drying it
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately after, can come out with
perfect, perfect bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're doing it sloppy where you're
just, oh, I've got WPM, I've got issues,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got issues, I gotta quickly do this
and then you try and dry it in the wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, you're probably just causing a
worse effect on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've personally, I actually did a test
last year on a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a storm that came through and it
knocked over one of my outdoor plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to, I wasn't able to fix it in time
because I was on vacation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing after another, the whole
entire plant pretty much got infected.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I did is I cut off, because with
bud washing, they said, oh, you can cut
[SPEAKER_02]: off all visible signs of bud rot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can cut off all visible signs of WPM,
cut off all that stuff and then throw it
[SPEAKER_02]: through the bud wash and then it'll wash
off all the spores, off all that stuff so
[SPEAKER_02]: that when you do dry it, it doesn't
regrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went through, right on stream in
front of everybody, I went through a full
[SPEAKER_02]: hydrogen peroxide bath and I sat there and
I was not being, I wasn't being light with
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was being a little bit tough with it
because I wasn't caring about ruining my
[SPEAKER_02]: bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was caring about wanting to see if this
worked or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew for a fact that this plant had bud
rot on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut off every visible sign that I could
possibly see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single one of the branches went
through a perfect hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lemon and baking soda, and then just a
freezing cold water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, I even sprayed them
all down just to try and make sure of
[SPEAKER_02]: anything in the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put it into an environment that is more
of a dry environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's less than 50% RH and you want to
dry in a 60-60 environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when your plants are soaking wet from,
oh, after a wash, you don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to make sure that your RH is low
for the first couple of days so that stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have a chance of regrowing and
then slowly increase your RH to that,
[SPEAKER_02]: or your RH in your temps to that 60-60 or
close to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 RH, 60 Fahrenheit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What I found with the washing is that even
in that dry environment of that 45 RH to
[SPEAKER_02]: 50, in four days, all of the, every single
one of the branches that I took off that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and did a full wash, every single
one of them had bud rot again in four or
[SPEAKER_02]: five days because I either missed a single
spore and I couldn't get it and it took
[SPEAKER_02]: off again, or I missed a single spore of
something and it took off again or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever, or I wasn't, the 40% humidity
wasn't low enough or I didn't have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: fans on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if you do it correctly to the
point where your bud is not so dirty,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you've got WPM all over your bud,
you've got bud rot all over your bud,
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally don't think that even if you
cut it off, I do not think you are getting
[SPEAKER_02]: all of it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you were to test that bud after
the full wash, I still think you will have
[SPEAKER_02]: counts of microbial bodies on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll have, it'll show up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might not decline or not pass the
testing, or it might pass the testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: sorry, but you'll still have some counts
of something on it, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: From everything that I've tried,
WPM is a huge problem here in Ontario and
[SPEAKER_02]: it is every single outdoor plant you put
outside, you are pretty much gonna have
[SPEAKER_02]: WPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to use some type of spray,
labs, some type of spray to get rid of it
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect your plants or have genetics in
plants that is resilient to that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the one thing I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant was perfectly fine all year
until the storm came through and then all
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sudden the bud rot got into the
plant, which is what happens, and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: goes through the stalk and then it takes
off from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you kinda get to the point where
you've now got this plant that visibly
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have any bud rot, gone through a
whole wash, you think there's none,
[SPEAKER_02]: you dry it, you jar it or whatever and all
of a sudden you start grinding it up or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever like that and you've now got,
some little bits and stuff inside it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: What the heck is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple things that might've made
it worse is that the washing might've sent
[SPEAKER_02]: it in even farther and if you have really
dense buds, you might've sent a spore or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever in a little bit farther and it
might've not been able to get out of it
[SPEAKER_02]: because the trichomes and stuff on the
outside of a plant is almost like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you do put this branch inside
water, it's almost like the water,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's hydrophobic almost and it's not until
you really shake it in there where you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually get it where it might be going
into the center of these flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're not really beating up your bud,
I don't know if it's really getting or
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna get rid of that or we have to use
higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide,
[SPEAKER_02]: which then starts to kinda count while
you're losing, you're oxidizing all your
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, you're oxidizing, you're causing
a lot of negatives, this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not against bud washing, I just think
that if your plant is too far gone,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think suggesting bud washing is
the best thing to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think suggesting getting rid of it is
probably better because I'm so big on
[SPEAKER_02]: molds and this and that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I grow is because I don't
know where others is coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know where mine is, so if I have a
problem, I can address it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't know where that problem is,
there's no addressing and then I have that
[SPEAKER_02]: paranoia factor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So anytime I see any bud rot, any WPM on
my plant, that plant immediately becomes a
[SPEAKER_02]: learning experience for me and I try to do
everything I can to get rid of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: either using lab spray, milk spray and if
I can't, no hard feelings for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it goes in the garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not risking it for me, I'm not
interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, what an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about a bunch of different
controversial topics, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was interested to hear that you had a
lot of experience doing some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: small things like with the green light,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had some good findings there with the
bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had some good findings there of
experience that you did yourself in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to come to the conclusions you came to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was pretty cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: They can find me on Twitch TV slash The
Bud Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can find me on every other social
media platform, The Bud Lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm live 24 seven, so there's always
something going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that it's summer coming here,
our outdoor garden is going to be opening
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get lots of plants out
there, which is going to be exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually have a virtual water gun
during the summer where anyone in the chat
[SPEAKER_02]: can actually turn on this water gun and
shoot squirrels or shoot me or my wife
[SPEAKER_02]: walking by when we're in the garden,
which is always fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have next week, we have a little bit of
an interview actually that you might be
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in with more of a lab talking
about bud rot, talking about microbes,
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about WPM, talking about what you
can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of interested in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said to Chris earlier,
I'm my own little guy over on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: People call me the Mr. Groat of Twitch
over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: People think we're brothers or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always have some fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Brothers from another mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll definitely have a link to your
Twitch channel down in the YouTube
