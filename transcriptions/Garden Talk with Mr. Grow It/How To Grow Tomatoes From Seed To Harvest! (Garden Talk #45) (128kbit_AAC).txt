[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause the tomatoes to split,
you know, and that's something that like
[SPEAKER_00]: happens all the times to people and they
ask me like why my tomatoes are splitting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to think that all this
vertical space around it, all the walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: fence, anything that it's around could be
used to train plants or to grow plants
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're gonna have a plant with the
same exact genetic as the plant that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have like growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're watering and like the water
splashing back to the leaves and this
[SPEAKER_00]: carry on like any sort of disease like
blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we need to nurture the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to apply like anything else,
anything specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just thrive by creating the right
conditions and leaving, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the biodiversity to develop above the soil
and under the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Alessandro aka
Spicy Mustache.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about growing
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really we're going to be covering from
seed all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is going to be a good
beginner friendly discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really discussion, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're going to be doing most of
the talking here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full disclaimer, I don't grow tomatoes
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking to grow tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's going to be really helpful
for me to be able to pick your brain on
[SPEAKER_01]: how to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way when I do go ahead and attempt
to grow them, you know, I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: better success rate than if I didn't have
this conversation with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we kind of talked about this
before we recorded as a lot of my audience
[SPEAKER_01]: grows medicinal varieties right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as coming onto the vegetable
side of things, any type of vegetable,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be tomatoes, any leafy greens
or just anything beyond that, people are
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a large majority of my audience
doesn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're looking to grow them or
maybe they just started growing them and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're looking for more tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I think that this conversation
is going to be awesome because it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: only going to provide me information on
how to do it and help me, but it's also my
[SPEAKER_01]: audience as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first things first, let's get into an
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started as a kid with my grandpa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say probably when I was two or
three, I used to spend time with him in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden until the age of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: But obviously, I didn't learn that much,
you know, even if he told me pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: everything about the living soil and how
to cooperate with nature rather than using
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals and all these kind of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I had to live a bit on site to
dedicate to my career.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started thinking about tattoos,
as you can tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved to London.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first impact with London was a
grey city, chaotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really couldn't find a place where
to spend time and disconnect and be a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more in touch with nature, even if it's
one of the greener cities in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did, I got really interested in
growing vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started on a balcony at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was something really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most case scenario was like seeds that
I bought from the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I don't know, I finished to eat a
chilli or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would split it up and plant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I got more interested into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I need to know more and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And starting, you know, different
techniques of growing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I moved to a house with a bigger
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started planning and planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first year was a bit of a disaster
because I couldn't really grow many
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, like by failing,
I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I could read the same exact thing
on a book, I had to try myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I moved roughly five or six
times, like over the course of seven
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each time I had to carry my glass
greenhouse, my soil, raised beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, everything like to a new
garden, to a new growing space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, now I got to a point that I
moved to a house and I've been here for
[SPEAKER_00]: like three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I managed to grow a lot of food,
especially during the full season.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can provide something like 50,
60 percent for myself and my girlfriend of
[SPEAKER_00]: like the total need of like vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, that's that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I started and like where I am
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you also have a YouTube channel,
which is very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have over twenty five thousand
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good quality videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really interesting photography and
videography as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the past 18 months, I've been
learning, editing videos and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pictures and all these kind of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it every night after my full time
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and I started the channel a bit
as a joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I really enjoyed explaining
people how to grow their own food in an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, now I do it like every single
week I post a new video on the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on all your success so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually a viewer that commented on
one of my videos and recommended that I
[SPEAKER_01]: talk to you on a podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's how that's all we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you to that viewer that
recommended Alessandro to come on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you say before we get deep
into tomatoes, what would you say is your
[SPEAKER_01]: style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, are you an indoor grower,
outdoor, do you go in soil, cocoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you organic or synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your grow style?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do I do everything mostly outdoor,
except if like growing gourmet mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: or microgreens that I do it indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I prefer to,
you know, I tried hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried different styles, but no offense
for all the growers doing hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still love it, you know, but I feel more
connected to nature whenever I put my
[SPEAKER_00]: hands into the soil, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started making my own mix of like,
you know, I was researching how to create
[SPEAKER_00]: the perfect mix, adding perlite or adding
a wall casting compost in the right ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then at some point, sorry,
I met Charles Dowding, which is an amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: grower in UK who invented a method called
an Nordic gardening, which basically means
[SPEAKER_00]: that so you can grow in any area,
even if you have weeds or grass growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just need to apply a layer of
cardboard in the case that you have weeds
[SPEAKER_00]: or grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, you can do it without the
cardboard and wet the cardboard and then
[SPEAKER_00]: add 15 centimeters of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a fully organic method that is
a minimal disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't dig, as the name implies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just simply I use a deeper,
which is a wooden sort of thick stick that
[SPEAKER_00]: I use to to create a hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I plant the plant without even
tapping the soil around it, but literally
[SPEAKER_00]: just leaving the plant to settle the roots
whenever I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a minimal disturbance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do, it's 100 percent organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to use different techniques,
including permaculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the closed loop system, I don't have
any wastage in the in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I use jadam, which is a Korean
natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I try to use what's cheap and
available around my area and convert it
[SPEAKER_00]: into things that I can, you know,
valuable things that I can use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden to grow food.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you're doing a lot of
things that are real environmentally
[SPEAKER_01]: friendly, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the variety of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one thing that you
mentioned that you want to talk about to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I watched a couple of videos you
have on tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have some beautiful harvests of
tomatoes with a whole bunch of different
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the different
varieties of tomatoes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: determinate versus indeterminate,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, in most cases, whenever you buy
a packet of seeds, it should say
[SPEAKER_00]: determinate or indeterminate varieties at
the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So determinate means simply like a plant
that grows to a set of leaves and fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't grow too tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also whenever it reached the right
height, it you don't have to do anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just stops and it produce most of the
fruits at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cool thing about this variety is
that you don't have to prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to remove the suckers,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get to the suckers as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to explain what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and also, yeah, it's for people that
don't want to take too much space in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it could be for a variety of
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we got indeterminate varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which means that it's a plant that it
doesn't grow to a set height, but it keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and it keeps producing suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it needs a constant pruning and tall
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you don't, you know, break the
plants because break the plants for the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of the fruit that keeps growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I personally prefer to grow
indeterminate varieties, but they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just because I prefer to prune and
guide the plant like on trellis for the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole season and having something that
keeps producing at different times rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than having like a, you know, a huge
harvest all at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once grows have an understanding of
that, you know, you can either start from
[SPEAKER_01]: by planting seeds or by buying a plant
from a local nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about, you know,
some of the differences, maybe like pros
[SPEAKER_01]: and cons, you know, buying seeds or
actually getting seeds from a tomato and
[SPEAKER_01]: then planting it versus buying at your
local nursery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any tips on any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for any grower, I would discourage them
from buying plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it before, but from buying plants
from the nursery, just because you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how they grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So potentially they could have like,
you know, chemicals or slow release
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer, anything that you're not aware
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the best advice and also more
satisfying is to start from seed all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to grow mostly heritage varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different kinds of seeds as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can find hybrids, you can find
seeds that are open pollinated,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means that like it's not like you're
not assured that the year after you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the same exact plant, but you could have
something a bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can buy heritage varieties,
which are varieties that basically like
[SPEAKER_00]: they manage to stabilize like and have
like a variety that it was like with good
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities or anything like that,
that it's passed on from generation after
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the one like the old,
I mean, the varieties that in my opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: are worth saving seeds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, passing on as well these
seeds sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's something that it's really,
really important in the modern society
[SPEAKER_00]: because like big companies try to,
you know, take away the confidence from
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means like refers to refer all the
times to the expert, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so the farmer is not so he's deprived
from confidence and all the times that
[SPEAKER_00]: like he needs to grow or even like the
small growing, not necessarily like the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer and all the times they need to grow
something like you refer to to whoever it
[SPEAKER_00]: says that knows better than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's something that,
you know, a hundred percent like you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: much more if you start from seed rather
than like a plant that you buy from from
[SPEAKER_00]: the nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you bought your seeds or you've
gotten seeds from a tomato ready to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: into a mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked a little bit about the mix that
you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a little bit deeper into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, what's an ideal mix or ideal
soil for tomatoes to be grown in?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomatoes are heavy feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means that like they require a lot
of feed to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend either like planting
like companion plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using plants that work, you know,
in kind of symbiotic effect with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they help the plant to grow and they
help each other or to use a mix that has
[SPEAKER_00]: like a good ratio of like compost and wall
casting, you know, so something that like
[SPEAKER_00]: the tomato can feed whenever they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, as I said before, I use the
nodding method, which is straight compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't add anything else rather than
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like whenever the plant needs it,
you know, they can just take whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient they need and like keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or alternatively, you can use even like so
like feeding like tea, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like for example, you grab the warm
casting, you put it in a bucket and you
[SPEAKER_00]: add like an air pump and you let it go for
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all the microbial activity,
the microorganism keeps multiplying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can apply to the soil and
transfer all these beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms and nutrients to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, there are options.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you are a beginner, I would say I
would suggest to not make it over
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go to your local garden center,
ask for an organic pre-mix and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, you know, if you get passionate,
if you get like really into gardening,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can start planning on how to make
your own or different techniques on how to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really good advice,
you know, especially for beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks will start off with that
bagged soil, that bagged mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here over in the States, very popular is
Fox Farm Ocean Forest Soil, Fox Farm Happy
[SPEAKER_01]: Frog, Roots Organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you saying that they could start in
any one of those bagged soils and then
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of improve from there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even for like, you know, if you manage
to make your own compost at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start like using that,
just dry compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, easy as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reducing your wastage and reusing it into
the garden, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as far as a container size to
plant into, you know, a lot of my audience
[SPEAKER_01]: is home growers, indoors, you can either
plant in containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you use raised beds outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's like the smallest container
size that you can successfully grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes in without worrying about,
you know, problems happening because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in too small of a container?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are loads, loads of information
online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like different recommendations on how to
grow there and like what size to use and
[SPEAKER_00]: all different advices, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I tried it myself in many,
many different containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like a 15, 20 liters container,
it's more than enough to start,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growing a plant and bring it to
fruit, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that literally like,
it's really resilient and it grows even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you make like many damages to the roots or
the plant itself, it's going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, especially in determinate
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I highly recommend it for a
beginner, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to experiment, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have, I saw many people using
like now air pots or fabric pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what I use if I'm growing
tomatoes in container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work great because yeah,
you have a lot of variation at the root
[SPEAKER_00]: level and you don't have like issues like
the level of moisture too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most beginners have, you know,
like that's the most common issue like
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would suggest to experiment
with like fabric pot or air pot and yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now transplanting, let's get a little bit
into that because I know for indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: growers in particular, a lot of people are
limited on space and you've done,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually you've done several videos on how
to grow in small spaces and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's say hypothetically, they're
starting in a small container,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have their seedling in a small
container, it sprouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point would you transplant into a
larger container?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then would you transplant multiple
times?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with some other plants, some folks
will go from like a small solo cup to a
[SPEAKER_01]: one gallon container up to their final
container, which three gallons,
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallons, seven gallons, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about transplanting a little
bit with tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first rule to check when your plant
is ready to be transplanted is to,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there are some drainage holes at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally you can just lift the plant
and check at the bottom if there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: roots poking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means or even worse, if the roots are
poking up so above the soil, this means
[SPEAKER_00]: that the root mass doesn't have enough
space to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's looking for new space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you need to do is to move it
to a new container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why, another reason why I
don't recommend buying plants from the
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery because most case scenario,
they are root bounded, which means that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, they left it to grow too much
in the same container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots took the shape of the
container and now it's almost a concrete
[SPEAKER_00]: mass that it's harder to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the roots can suffocate themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the best thing coming back to
transplanting is to transplant a tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: plant as deep as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go straight into a big
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, usually I start in a small
pot, even let's say plastic capsize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I go straight into my
raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you need to do is to break the root
mass, like we said, if it's too tangled
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be scared of breaking it because as
I said, it's a really resilient plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people, they remove a few roots and
they're worried that they damage the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, you can remove as many roots as
you want, except that you don't remove
[SPEAKER_00]: them completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you check along the plant,
along the main stem, there are some white
[SPEAKER_00]: hair and those white hair are called
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they could be glandular trichomes or
non-glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So glandular trichomes are basically,
they turn both first of all into roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: new roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means this is why I'm saying like
plant it as deep as possible because all
[SPEAKER_00]: this white hair, they're going to turn
into roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually remove the bottom leaves and I
plant it really deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then all this white hair turn into
roots and you're going to have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: really solid root system and the plant can
grow pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they also help the plant to be
protected from rain or climate and from
[SPEAKER_00]: pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that they got different function,
these trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go straight, as I say,
into a big container.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no need to transplant into a
medium one, a bigger one and a bigger one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants are going to develop super
quick because I saw tomatoes literally
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going into the garden one day and
they were 10 centimeters and the day after
[SPEAKER_00]: they were 15, 20 centimeters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so satisfying to see this plant
growing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about feeding nutrients or
fertilizing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say they started in that small
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: They transplanted into a larger container
or their raised bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: At some point, I assume that the soil is
going to be depleted of the nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: it needs to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at what point would they feed and what
would they feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I used to feed the tomatoes is,
as I said, you could grab this bag of soil
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a brand, I don't remember the
name now, but basically it was pre-made
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the nutrients start to finish for
a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to do anything else at
that point, which is great for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or alternatively, you can use something
that... I don't really like to buy things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are claimed to be organic from the
shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because lots of companies claim it to be
like an organic feed for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the end, it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just something that you can make at
home, for example, to feed a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you finish your season and you have
like an older tomato plant, you can cut it
[SPEAKER_00]: and chop it down into pieces, put it into
a bucket, go to your local woods and grab
[SPEAKER_00]: some leaf mold, which is the leaves,
the like drops, leaves and stems,
[SPEAKER_00]: the drops from the trees, and turn into
this dark brown golden fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You grab one handful, you put it into a
bucket, along with all those broken down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, stems and part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you add unchlorinated water or
rainwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unchlorinated means simply like water that
it stands outside, outdoor, or with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cup open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you give the chance to like the excess
of chlorine to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of it, because obviously plants
still need chlorine to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and that's one of the best feeds
that you can use for a tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you think about it,
like a tomato plant, whenever it's fully
[SPEAKER_00]: mature, has already everything that it's
required for the plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing else that it requires.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all inside the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding this component into the bucket
with water, you add these microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: from the forest floor that are going to
break down all these micro and
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients, and they're going to make
it available again for the plant to be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something like a really super
easy fertilizer that anyone can make at
[SPEAKER_00]: home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say that sounds really
easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You explained it in such a way that makes
it easy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone wants to know more, by the way,
it's called a JADAM liquid fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find in Korean natural
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a book called JADAM that you can
buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great book.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you talked a little bit about water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you said rainwater or
dechlorinated water.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how about the actual watering process?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some plants, it's so easy to
overwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any tips for watering or any
just general advice?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a really cool tip that I learned if
you're watering like pots, it's either to
[SPEAKER_00]: like stick your finger into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like take it out and like try to feel
like how moist is the finger.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it feels completely dry, obviously you
need to water the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, like you can wait to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hold on because the plant is going
to access all the moisture that it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to be at the bottom,
at the top, midway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can access all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are going to extend to get into
it and like, and they're going to absorb
[SPEAKER_00]: that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or alternatively, like whenever you
transplant your plant and you put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your container, the first thing that you
need to do is to lift your container and
[SPEAKER_00]: you feel the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's something that it takes,
you know, it takes a bit of time to learn,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you lift your container and you feel
the weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you water it and you lift it again
and you can feel the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then whenever your plant feels light
again, I mean, as light as when you
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted it, it's time to water your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be an easy tip that anyone,
you know, could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use to to to water a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for tomatoes, it's really important
that you have a constant watering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, because if you don't have a
constant moisture for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically you can you can have different
issues like like there is a tension on the
[SPEAKER_00]: skin of the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you alter this, you know,
watering period between like giving water
[SPEAKER_00]: to the plant and waiting, I mean,
if you're not constant in giving water to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, like this tension could make
the tomato split because the plant is not
[SPEAKER_00]: used anymore to like that moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever you apply again after a
drought or after a period that you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: water, it can cause the tomatoes to split,
you know, and that's that's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: like happens all the time to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they ask me like, why my tomatoes are
splitting, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's yeah, it's not so easy to learn
like when when to water like a tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are tricks, like like I said,
the weight or mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulching, it's another great tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just grab like straw,
wood chips or anything which is organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I don't like to use inorganic,
you know, mulching, even if like at the
[SPEAKER_00]: shop you can buy them anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You apply to the to the surface of your
plant after after you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what happens, they're going
to retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, they're going to protect the
microorganisms in your soil so they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get disturbed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you can get some like I've got a
mineralized straw that every time I water
[SPEAKER_00]: it, it slowly release minerals into the
soil, which is a win win, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those things that you mentioned
are very similar to growing medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because, you know, like I
mentioned, a lot of my viewers do grow
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I feel like as we continue to talk
on, a lot of folks are going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: catch on pretty easily and be able to have
that transition easily and be more
[SPEAKER_01]: successful on their first grow,
since it is so similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about training and pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Important things, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about training and
pruning tomatoes in order to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I usually what I normally use is
Bumble Sticks just to like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: start the plant like growing it straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sell crazy things, not so crazy,
but like people growing it upside down,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you can do 100
percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow the plant upside down and
they're just going to produce the roots at
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to, you know,
to use any sort of trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing that I use other than
Bumble Sticks, it's metal wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just twist the metal wire
around the Bumble Stick and then go along
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know, a structure of your
greenhouse or your fence or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that it's a vertical space and
fix it with like some staple or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant is going to grow along that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just, you know, use some twine or
like cotton twine is best like around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so you support this growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also I also suggest to make DIY in a
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if anyone is interested, you can find
them in on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just with timbers, you build a
structure and then you use cotton twine to
[SPEAKER_00]: support the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, use it like double,
because if you use a single twine,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to it's just going to break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cool thing about cotton twine is
that at the end, whenever you finish to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow your plant, you can just cut it at
the base with like including the cotton
[SPEAKER_00]: twine and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just compost everything because it's
compostable, you know, and then make it
[SPEAKER_00]: again for the for the season after.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you if you use things like to
impermeable to make like the food
[SPEAKER_00]: impermeable, it's you know, it's perfect
because it's going to last you like
[SPEAKER_00]: probably four or five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with a bit of DIY, I was really bad
with DIY, but I learned, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: thanks to YouTube, thanks to books,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you could put potentially use
that to support your plant and make it
[SPEAKER_00]: grow vertical, you know, especially in an
urban garden like like the one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like most people, you know, think about
the space having a horizontal perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to think that all this
vertical space around all the walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: fence, anything that it's around could be
used to train plants or to grow plants
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah, that's a training.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you could potentially use.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about topping that technique?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked to us about topping
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping, as I mentioned before,
or it's also called removing suckers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The suckers are basically like so you have
the tomato plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your main stem and then you go
the branches poking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from the intersection between the
main stem and the branch, all the times
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see these stems growing
out that they look different from a branch
[SPEAKER_00]: and they look more like the top of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these stems are suckers,
which is the plant that is just trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, grow new branches to expand,
you know, and produce more fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you need to do, especially for
indeterminate varieties, for determinate
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, most case scenario,
you don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for indeterminate, you need to cut it
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't have to chuck it away
because that's a cool thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by by doing this, you can just,
you know, remove the lower leaves of this
[SPEAKER_00]: sucker poking out and stick it in a glass
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these trichomes that we mentioned
before, they're going to produce roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a plant with a plant
with the same exact genetic as the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have, like growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means I do it every year for like
either to give it a way to all my
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors that everyone is asking me all
the times or to, you know, having a backup
[SPEAKER_00]: because you never know like something
could go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if some anything goes wrong,
you still got the same exact plant growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in a smaller size, but still, you know,
the same the same genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was an amazing plant that you had
outdoor and you were like really happy
[SPEAKER_00]: with it, you can still have a backup with
the same exact genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another thing about like pruning
this plant is that once they reach,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say something around 60
centimeters, 50 centimeters, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: prune the bottom part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means remove all the lower leaves
because whenever you water your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: around the plant, most of the disease
comes from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is that there is a
bouncing back effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're watering and like the water
splashes back to the leaves and this carry
[SPEAKER_00]: on like any sort of disease like blight,
you know, anything that could damage your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by removing them, first of all,
you improve the airflow of like the air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation, especially if you have many
plants growing in a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also you encourage the plants to
redirect all the energies back to the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: like into the fruit or into the vegetative
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means like growing like in size,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, these are just two of the tricks
that like you could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also another great thing about the
mulching method that I mentioned is by
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this, other than retaining the
moisture and protecting your micro and
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms, you are limiting the
bouncing back effect because obviously you
[SPEAKER_00]: have something on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, like this water,
like every time you're watering around
[SPEAKER_00]: your tomato is not bouncing up that much,
but it's kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just settling down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched upon a couple of problems that
could potentially happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another problem that I want to dive deeper
into is pests, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about what you do in order
to prevent pests from invading your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, as I said, I'm an organic
rover, so I don't use any chemical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are different techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one is to make homemade
liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do at the beginning of the
season, I go out to the local park,
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that it's like check with the
council if they sprayed it with some
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty, you know, like chemicals or
whatever, because most of the times they
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just go there, you look for
nettles, like the young ones, not the old
[SPEAKER_00]: ones, and you cut them at the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these nettles, like, other than being
like bad, whenever you touch them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're also really bad for pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they tend to stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, I grab a cheesecloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab all these nettles, like these new
shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chop it down into small pieces,
and then I add some crushed garlic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is also really good to repel pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I leave all this into a cheesecloth
and into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into a bucket of water for probably like
three to four weeks infusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after three to four weeks,
you can use this straight to spray your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants top and bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is good, you know, as a
prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the main thing that you should use is
companion planting, which is like the
[SPEAKER_00]: best, best thing to use in any sort of
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for automator, there are a few plants
that you can use, like marigolds are a
[SPEAKER_00]: really good because they repel green and
black flies, like poor form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone that doesn't know like what are
green and black flies, they are aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can use this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are really, really effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can either plant them all around the
tomato plant, and they create a sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: barrier, which is deceiving for the pests,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cannot tell if there is a tomato
behind it because the smell is too strong
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recommend to plant them three weeks
in advance because another cool thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the marigold does with the tomato is they
create a symbiotic relationship between
[SPEAKER_00]: the roots of the marigolds and the
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they repel, so that dangerous
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are cool nematodes, let's call
them like that, that you can use in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden and they are good to, you know,
repel some kind of pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are also like bad nematodes that
could create damages to your plant and any
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of bad thing that could happen to
your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another plant that I use in combo with
the tomato is basil, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I usually tend to pair the plants
that they are, if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: basil and tomato are pairing perfectly in
a kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why not pairing them in the garden,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they are great because they
cooperate and they repel like not only
[SPEAKER_00]: green and black flies, but also white
flies and all the kind of pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, and this plant can be
interplanted between the lines of tomatoes
[SPEAKER_00]: or even if you have a pot, you know,
you can plant it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to develop fully,
but still, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to have it like, I used to clone
basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just snip off the tops and the
same as suckers, stick into the water and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to produce new roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you transplant into the soil and
you can have them like in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to place them around the
garden, even like if they were not planted
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil, but like around the pot or
like just around the base of a tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they help to repel all these nasty
pests, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing that it's amazing to use
in the garden is nasturtium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that is fully edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots, stems, leaves, flowers,
anything from this plant is edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit of a peppery flavor,
so not everyone likes it, but you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: used to it because it's really versatile
in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cool thing, it's called a
sacrificial plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do, like let's say I dedicate a
raised bed to tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plant a pot with a nasturtium close by
and this plant is going to attract all the
[SPEAKER_00]: black flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then so they're going all on the plant
because they prefer nasturtium rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: like your main crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can simply, whenever they're
full of pests, you can simply get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: your nasturtium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's called a sacrificial
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's amazing because thanks to this
combination of plants, you can have a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also leave a few basil plants to flower
and they attract beneficial pollinators
[SPEAKER_00]: like I don't know, ladybugs or lacewings
that they feed on green and black flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all this cooperation allows me to not
use anything at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there is a cool thing, a cool
sentence that is mentioned in the Korean
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming, which is do as nature
does, which means like cooperating with
[SPEAKER_00]: nature because it provides already all we
need to nurture the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to apply like anything else,
anything specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just thrive by creating the right
conditions and leaving the biodiversity to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop above the soil and under the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about the transition to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, flowering bloom, the fruiting
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tomato plants, they have male and
female parts on the same plant and they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to really be, we often call on the
medicinal side of things, pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the whole
transitioning the flower process,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how to pollinate and so on and
so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So tomato plants, like whenever they reach
maturity, as you say, like they develop
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and these flowers, they're going
to develop into fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most case scenario, if you have them
outdoors, you create the right conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: you attract pollinators and these
pollinators, they all, they do the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't need to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just jump from one flower to another
and they pollinate your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this doesn't happen, let's say you
have them inside a greenhouse or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like they're not easily
accessible for pollinators, you can hand
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just simply shake this flower
like literally shake them like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they drop all this pollen that then
gets released and it goes on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is like so easy, like doing so,
like they start pollinating all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and you're going to have fruit
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like one of the easiest thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, like if you are feeding your
plant with a specific feeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, like you were using like a
vegetative feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to allow, so fulling nitrogen to help
the plant develop inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to swap to something that is made
for, you know, flowers to develop a fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lower in nitrogen, a bit higher in
phosphorus, potassium and other
[SPEAKER_00]: micronutrients that you can find in
nutrients, both from the store.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so tomatoes are growing on the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point do you harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when do you harvest plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should always harvest them whenever
they're fully ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever they are, like most case
scenario, you're going to see a tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: that turns completely red.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm growing varieties, for example,
there are heirloom varieties that are
[SPEAKER_00]: called Black Beauty and they develop
whenever they are bordeaux, like really
[SPEAKER_00]: dark red.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of hard to tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the ideal stage from when to
harvest your tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you happen to harvest them whenever
they're still green because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions that I mentioned, you can just
bring them indoor and there are ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: turning them into chutney or which is
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as good as like fully ripe
tomatoes, but it's still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can, a trick that I tried and it
worked, you can drop them in a newspaper
[SPEAKER_00]: and leave it inside the box in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like thanks to the darkness and
because they got disconnected from the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and all that, like they slowly ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100% of the times that it
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard people that they put like the
tomato close to bananas or apples,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that helps the transition
like the tomato to ripe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it was me, but you know,
like for me, it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this trick like of dropping them
works great, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I know it's not the ideal way of
like when picking your tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still like if it happens that you grow
in them and then you like are such a shame
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can't, you know, make them fully
ripe and take them indoor, you can still,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do something about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if they're not fully ripe,
you can still pick them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, they'll actually ripen if
you're in a desperate situation to where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't wait until the very end or
you're getting that cold weather or so on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many different problems
that you could run into.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's three of that I kind of want to
highlight that I was hoping you'd be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one being Pottery Mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two being Blossom Enrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number three, which you've already
kind of touched on is the skin splitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so the most common thing that could
happen to your tomato plant, at least in
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have similar weather like UK,
which is, you know, really humid or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: recreate these conditions by, for example,
watering a lot or like not having
[SPEAKER_00]: something like enough drainage in your
soil that allows the moisture to drain
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blight, it's tomato blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this past season, we had,
you know, like it was a drama for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers here in the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone had issues with this blight
because it affects the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically the plant starts
rotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to notice it from the main
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are parts of the main stem that turn
into, they turn completely black and they
[SPEAKER_00]: slowly spread and they go into the fruit
and into the leaves and the whole plant
[SPEAKER_00]: get affected and you can just simply,
you know, say goodbye to your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there are old methods claim to work,
but they only work to slow down the spread
[SPEAKER_00]: of the blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get rid of the blight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in that case, you can't
really do much about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to tuck away the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I discovered,
I would say one year ago, that I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of is that most people tend to burn
the plant because they're worried,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that you're going to have blight
the season after.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was talking again with this Charles
Dowding that is sort of my mentor in
[SPEAKER_00]: growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He explained to me that like you can
easily compost it and like add the
[SPEAKER_00]: affected parts of the plant into the
compost because they thrive only with
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after like four months or three
months or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends on the growing conditions on
the climate and many things, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going to die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and you don't have to worry
that much that the year after you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to spread this blight all over your
garden, which is a great thing because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you would think like,
ah, I wasted not only the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to chuck it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, we have this closed loop
that we can save the plant material and
[SPEAKER_00]: reuse it into the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you could potentially have other
issues affecting the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, like if you're not constantly
watering, you have the splitting of the
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato skin and which ruins the fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's like the plant is
ruined because, you know, you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have not that regular nice shape and tasty
tomatoes that you could have had,
[SPEAKER_00]: like if you maintained, you know,
a nice schedule like in watering your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the problems that you could have like
on a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good information this entire
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super glad that you that you came on
here and spilled your knowledge to all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wrapping things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I've got a book coming that is
coming in around March and it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be all about urban gardening
and how to grow food in either a small
[SPEAKER_00]: space, big space, no matter where you
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: I explain different techniques about
Korean natural farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find it in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't spoil it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can find me on my YouTube
channel Spicy Most Dutch or Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Plants for the Futures are really
exciting collaboration that I still didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: announce, but I'm going to announce it now
with BBC and doing an introduction video
[SPEAKER_00]: for Sir David Attenborough and for his new
series and also potentially being on a TV
[SPEAKER_00]: series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what the future brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are the plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I saw in your about section.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you've been seen on many different
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Guardian newspaper, Wales Online,
Vlad Bible, Good News Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're featured in so many different
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially during lockdown, there was a
period of time that everyone was
[SPEAKER_00]: interested in growing food, you know,
into the garden community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone was like, how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll definitely have a link to your
