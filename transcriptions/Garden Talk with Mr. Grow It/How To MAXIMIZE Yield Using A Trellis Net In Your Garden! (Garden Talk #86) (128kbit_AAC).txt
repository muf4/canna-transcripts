[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The scrawl technique means utilizing and
maximizing my light and the space of my
[SPEAKER_01]: grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use masonry 22 because it does
sometimes have that wax coating and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: tough and it's nice and thin so those are
the three that I use to string up the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna get bigger right at your
screen level which you don't really want
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not as opposed to the
light so there's gonna be a lot of little
[SPEAKER_01]: node sites that you want to defoliate in
your flower defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to talk sooner so that means
that my whole sizing is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit smaller so I can talk sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely going to probably yield
a bit more scrawling than you would
[SPEAKER_01]: typically off a normal kind of plant but
only because you're going to be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: top dense colas on your screen and every
bud you have is going to be a top cola
[SPEAKER_01]: that has density to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast this episode number 86.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Northern
Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 20 years and is
well known for being a Scrogger and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're gonna get into in today's
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about how he does the Scrog
technique in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.

[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Troy, also known
as Northern Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me here,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm glad you decided to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually reached out to me first,
although I had many people reach out to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and request that you come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've seen what you're doing over on
your YouTube channel and Instagram and
[SPEAKER_00]: just really blown away at what you do in
the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're going to get
into today is your style of plant
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: More particular, what you're well known
for is the Scrog technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to really get deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean by that is I want to get into
the nitty-gritty details of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll ask some of those deep detail
oriented questions so people can learn
[SPEAKER_00]: your technique and potentially implement
it in their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to first say I appreciate
everything that you do for our community,
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually watched your videos on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quite a few years ago, I learned a lot
from you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just from all your little garden talk
shows, I watched them and I learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you from me and a
lot of people that probably don't get to
[SPEAKER_01]: do this and talk to you and say thank you
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate what you do, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm ready now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your positive words.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's positive words like that,
positive feedback that really are fuel for
[SPEAKER_00]: us content creators to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have people that are gaining value
from our content, we're going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: spending our time making the content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your positive words.
[SPEAKER_01]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You deserve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what happened to me was I was
introduced at a very young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: My family actually used it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up knowing it, seeing it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was actually younger, probably
about eight years old, maybe 10 years old,
[SPEAKER_01]: I followed my parents out to the garage
where I was supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stumbled into a kind of a grow up,
just like what you see back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just white plastic sheets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I opened up the plastic sheets and I saw a
few medicinal plants sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, it was shocking, but it was
really kind of cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, as I grew up in life,
I became interested in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mom started showing me a few little
tips when I was younger about how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was a Scrogger, kind of cool,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my mom taught me how to Scrog as I
got older.
[SPEAKER_01]: I threw a few little of my own tips into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things just took off from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just kept on Scrogging ever since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really grow anything else
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just call myself Northern Scrogger
because I live in Canada, in a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Northern region of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not quite North of Canada,
but we call ourselves Northern Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I call myself Northern Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a pretty big following over there
and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you get into wanting to produce
content?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, that's pretty neat.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to me was during our COVID,
when COVID first came out, everyone kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of got laid off from their jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was one of them, but I always had a
Scrog going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always a Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start showing my Scrogs on
Facebook groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to show my Scrogs and then
I'm going to add a little tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help people learn how to Scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that one tip and that one tip kind
of blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people liked it and a lot of
people asked me for more.
[SPEAKER_01]: A week later, I took another picture of my
grow and I was like, this is another tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when you should talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I added that tip and that kind of blew up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then people started telling me,
you should make your own group on
[SPEAKER_01]: Facebook, your own group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I created my own group called
Scroggers, which is my hat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got told by people that make an
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I created an Instagram called Northern
Scrogger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, that got deleted and I have a
new one called The Northern Scrogger on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really what happened was the initial
Facebook reactions was got me thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: like, wow, I could really help a lot of
people in this technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should just keep pushing and try to
become good at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good at creating content to help new
growers and help even experienced growers
[SPEAKER_01]: if they want to learn how to Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just an indoor grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you also do outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you organic or synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil, cocoa hydro?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used to do outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it became legalized more so in
Canada, I got right into the indoor grows
[SPEAKER_01]: steadily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the indoor grows more because I can
control my environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outdoor grows, I always like you do
good, but I feel like later on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: season that the environment changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's too humid for what the
plant needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a latent flower and you're up high
humidity and it's pouring rain every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got sick of outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just took it right to the indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a synthetic grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I use future harvest nutrients
for all my synthetic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to learn how to organic grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't like the bug aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes there's a lot of bugs with
organic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some bugs are good bugs,
but I'm just not there yet with wine bugs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be in my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good with synthetic right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly feel that plants don't tell the
difference from organic to synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's a lot of difference in all
the bottles you have, all the time it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes to mix the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time-saving right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many pros and cons to each,
but I do want to get into it and just try
[SPEAKER_01]: it and expand my knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoors in particular, it's a whole
different battlefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, the plant that we're growing that
we all know and love is very resilient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be able to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has its own unique challenges,
indoor versus outdoor and organic versus
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd definitely like to hear about what the
guest's growth style is because I can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely help lead the conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess to start, a really basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have beginners that tune into this
podcast as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we say Scrog, what is the Scrog
technique?
[SPEAKER_01]: In a lot of people's mind, the Scrog
technique is called the screen of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: This screen behind me would be just full
of colas eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, in my mind, the Scrog technique
means utilizing and maximizing my light
[SPEAKER_01]: and the space of my grow area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll build my screen the size of my grow
space that will work my light.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have a five by five flowering
footprint light, I'll build a five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll maximize that screen by filling it
full of colas as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll maximize my light to feed all of
these colas at the same height as each
[SPEAKER_01]: other with a full canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, that's what Scrog is in my mind,
is maximizing my light and my space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you answer my next question,
which is what size net do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just mentioned if you're in a five by
five space, that net size is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: five feet by five feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with the smaller spaces,
I assume, that you grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lights coverage area will be the size
of the net, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what you want to aim for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have a screen that's like,
say, four by four screens, you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: at four by four or 10, I can still use
lights that are capable of a five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: space in a four by four or 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just don't have to have it turned up
all the way or dialed up all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just definitely wouldn't build a screen
much bigger than five by five because most
[SPEAKER_01]: of our lights that we use these days are a
five by five footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't buy much more than that right
now with the LED world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just got to not use your head,
but just think about your footprint of
[SPEAKER_01]: your light and the size of the screen that
you want to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in these nets, trellis net is often
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different size trellis nets as
far as the holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size holes do you go for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's three inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's four inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be some other sizes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size holes do you prefer in your net?
[SPEAKER_01]: In my net, I don't buy a trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: I build my own screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is I build my own screens
anywhere from 2.5 inches to 3.5 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I do that is because if I go any
smaller than 2.5 inches, then sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: when your plants grow, the nose spacing
gets tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a two inch hole space,
then your nose will get trapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: As your plant gets more into flower,
those nose spaces become buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when they get fat and they extend.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're all stuck underneath a screen
that only has two inch hole spacing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get problems like PM and
mildew and no air movement basically
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're growing a real tight
carpet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use say 2.5 to 3.5 because now I
can have space for each node to grow up
[SPEAKER_01]: through a separate hole on my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easier to tuck when your holes are a
little bit smaller compared to say a four
[SPEAKER_01]: inch hole size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have a four inch hole size,
then you got to wait for your branch to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow up at least four inches before you
can tuck it underneath again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really want my branches to grow
four inches because by that time they are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get a little bit thicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are going to develop more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their node sites are going to start
thinking like they're on a vertical growth
[SPEAKER_01]: path instead of being on a horizontal that
I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to tuck sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that my hole sizing is going to
be a little bit smaller so I can tuck
[SPEAKER_01]: sooner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also why I tie my own strings on my scrawl
frames is for harvesting purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to cut my string when I harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to buy them every time,
they're not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they are relatively cheap,
but not cheap in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want to wrestle their screen off so
they can save that screen for the next
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is it's cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just cut down two sides of my frame
and then I just pull the twine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just slides right out perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever I use just slides right out and
the plant doesn't just fall down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of just kind of just like
mushrooms and just sits there ready for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to chop it at the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I kind of went in a little bit
detail there, but yeah, the screen hole
[SPEAKER_01]: sizing is just like 2.5, 3.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I build my own and I have videos on
YouTube on how to build your own and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really, really easy and it takes 10
minutes to string one of these frames up
[SPEAKER_01]: once you have the frame built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for explaining the pros and cons
for the different sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these things you don't think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason why I like to string my own
scrawl screens up is because when I tuck a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch, I can actually grab the twine that
I use and I can slide it with my fingers a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and I can tuck that branch
under, slide the twine and then I'll hold
[SPEAKER_01]: the branch with one of the fan leaves will
hold that twine and I can let go and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy a store bought twine,
you can't slide that position at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't move it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't slide it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another good tip right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I do move my screen around
sometimes to pull it closer when I tuck so
[SPEAKER_01]: I can make it reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good tip right there I want to
throw in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good call out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using twine that you purchased,
I assume from a local store or online,
[SPEAKER_00]: can you talk to us about like the actual
building of the frame by using PVC and
[SPEAKER_00]: what size PVC?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you actually affixing the twine to
the PVC so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about like the build of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I use three quarter inch
PVC and then I buy these little tees that
[SPEAKER_01]: are called three way tees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I advise new growers is to buy
four way PVC tees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That just gives you another extension on
the top if you ever need a second trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I build these screens,
three quarter inch PVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whatever I want my bowl sizing to
be is I run screws down the top of my
[SPEAKER_01]: screen three inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now all my screens are three inch
hole spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every three inches, I'll put a black
mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I just get tap drilling screws and I
just screw in every black mark that takes
[SPEAKER_01]: it probably takes me like to build a five
by five screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll probably take a good like one hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes some time, but you have it
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're not using this frame,
I can just take it all apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into pieces and I can I can like wrap it
up in tape and a nice little neat little
[SPEAKER_01]: bundle and I can store it somewhere for
when I want to start over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pull it out, put it all together,
do my twine again, which takes a few
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes and then I'm ready to rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to use twine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use masonry rope and I like to
use hemp twine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a difference between a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to use a twine,
you want to try to get a wax coated twine
[SPEAKER_01]: because the hairs fray off it and you'll
have a bunch of like fraying hairs on your
[SPEAKER_01]: on when you take pictures and see a bunch
of hairs on your twine exposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use hemp twine, it also frays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a bunch of hair exposed like
fraying hairs off the twine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hemp twine is not bad because it's
biodegradable and you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: probably smoke a little bit of it gets
caught in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use masonry twine, too,
because it does sometimes have that wax
[SPEAKER_01]: coating and it's tough and it's nice and
thin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the three that I use to
string up the string up the actual frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how many plants are you doing
underneath the net there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing a plant per square foot or
like how do you go about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I like to do one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have at least two feet by two
feet square feet for one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm doing a five by five straw,
I'll probably grow like four plants under
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm doing like a two by two straw frame
because there is two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow one plant under a nice two by
two frame and one plant, it works perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if I had a four by four frame,
I'd probably do like two or maybe three
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just like to keep like, yeah,
like two foot area kind of for one plant
[SPEAKER_01]: at least because I do veg for only like I
know people think I veg for a long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I really do only veg for two months
from a seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, it takes a seedling to take
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes out of it three weeks just for a
seedling to really start to take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's three weeks right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm then I'm talking underneath
the screen for like a month in a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm flipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what would you say the measurement is
between the top of the grill pot and the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is just what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to tell you things that I
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that I scrog is I like to keep
my screens six to eight inches off the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of my pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go any more than eight and I
really don't even go eight anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just recommend that is the maximum
height.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I only say eight inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: For like the elderly people, for people
that like have to really get under there
[SPEAKER_01]: and work on their plants, have really big
arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want a little bit more space under
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like to go six inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to keep my screen low as
possible because that's going to shorten
[SPEAKER_01]: my veg time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've actually heard as high as 18
inches from the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six inches is actually the lowest I've
heard, but it makes sense, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because exactly what you just said,
you can reduce the amount of veg time you
[SPEAKER_00]: have, your real squat to the actual net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can go into a little bit of that
if you want me to, a little bit why I keep
[SPEAKER_01]: my screens low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually another question would be,
when do you start the training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just bending branches down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any topping first or fimming
first and then starting to get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: screen or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is first I have my cups or my
plants in like a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wait about two weeks, two weeks and a
couple of days ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put them in my five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to let them be in that
five gallon pot for like maybe one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: days just to like kind of recuperate from
a transplant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just give them a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as that plant is like enough for
me to start tying onto, I'm going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: training it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might not top it right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I'm going to bend it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put a little tie on its
bottom stock and keep the main stem coming
[SPEAKER_01]: from our soil, keep that straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to tie off the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to bend the top as I keep the
main stem firm and straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people miss that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just tie from the top and their whole
plant comes on a lean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're like ripping the roots around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see it, but you're really like
hurting the bottom of the plant there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you really want to tie off this
bottom of your plant and then tie down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I do that, I will keep on
training that plant, all the individual
[SPEAKER_01]: branches that start growing up,
I'll tie them to the sides of my pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do that for the first month of the
plant's growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even from seedling right for the first
month, I'm just tying down the branches
[SPEAKER_01]: once I transplant it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after one month, I put my screens
on and I get my plants all ready for the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen and I untie all the branches from
the pot and I let the plant just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: push up into the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I continue tucking it for another
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that this is where I keep my screens
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my screen is only six inches off
the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant will reach that six inches
real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually within a month of growth,
it's up six inches high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm not waiting for it to be 18
inches high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using every node on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the first node on that plant that
most people trim off in defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They trim off the first few nodes so they
can expose the top of their plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm using every node on my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll start training every node all
around my branch, all around my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For another month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's when I will flip the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always flip the flower on two months no
matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I figured out from struggling for
a long time and the size of screens that I
[SPEAKER_01]: use, what we just talked about,
how much I have for per plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: two feet by two feet per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that in two months, it's pretty
much time for me to flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to continue tucking for that
first two weeks of me flipping the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the flower stretch, I'm still
tucking my branches underneath my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my main tips of scrogging is
keep on tucking during the flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you waiting to flip the flower
until every single one of those squares is
[SPEAKER_00]: full?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you like 95% full and then you do
the flip to flower or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what I do is I flip no matter what at
two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I figured out that it only takes two
months to fill that size of the screen
[SPEAKER_01]: that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had a big, big screen with one plant,
I could veg for longer and try to fill
[SPEAKER_01]: more of the screen up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to run out of space on
your screens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you run out of space on your
screen, then you're going to have runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: branches that are taller than other
branches on your screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're not maximizing your light
anymore because you got to work your light
[SPEAKER_01]: to the top of that runoff branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't work it on the whole canopy
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to have a little bit of space on
my screen still.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm about to harvest, I want to see
the edges still exposed because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: aim to fill my screen and I don't aim for
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I aim for quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here for quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I do the two month veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: To fill up each hole in the screen is
actually really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to have two bud
sites per hole the way that I scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gets really packed in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why you want to have the three
inch hole spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you don't have the three inch
hole spacing or three and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to fit two nodes,
two bud sites in that hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to get too cramped with
two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's why I say three to four
inch or sorry, 2.5, 3.5 inch hole size on
[SPEAKER_01]: your screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned some branches coming up and
kind of outgrowing some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: branches in the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you manage that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there things that you can do in order
to kind of control the height?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people will do super cropping,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll super crop that branch and
allow the other branches to grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do when some of
those branches grow out of control and
[SPEAKER_00]: outgrow the other branches?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, typically what I do is I honestly
keep up on my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm usually there and I'm working it every
other day and I'm talking branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't normally have that many
runoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I was to go away for say a while
and I came home and there was a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: runoffs, I would do the super crop
technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd kind of pinch that branch,
stunt it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was still in say vegetation,
I would maybe top that branch low and then
[SPEAKER_01]: start tucking the nodes that come off
where I topped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start tucking them again and start
working them into my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if I'm in late flower and I have
a runoff in late flower, then you just
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of just got to ride it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not much you can do in late flower
because you're not going to super crop
[SPEAKER_01]: that branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could stress the plant out too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to top it in late flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my mind, I'd be like, oh, I kind of
messed up on this grog because I let it
[SPEAKER_01]: get away from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had that loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had plants that just keep on
stretching in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, holy, it's just crazy girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I like to keep up
on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing is in late flower,
you'll notice on your screens that
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes the center of the screen is
pushing up more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks more like higher on the canopy
than everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I would do is go underneath my screen
and I'll just tie a piece of string to the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual string of the frame and I'll pull
it down and I'll tie it to a weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I look at my canopy, I'll pull it down
so it's level again and then I'll tie a
[SPEAKER_01]: weight on and I'll hold it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you use the screen like this,
you can pull your screen down and your
[SPEAKER_01]: whole canopy will actually flex up and
down as you pull on the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pull on my screen until it's
perfectly level again, tie it off and then
[SPEAKER_01]: now I'm maximizing my light again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the reason why I ask, I know you
mentioned that you tuck for the first week
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower and then after that,
you're kind of letting the branches grow
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I was generally said that the
plant stretches for 21 days after flipping
[SPEAKER_00]: the light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, that's going to depend on
some factors, genetics, what light cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually on and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that 14 days is what I was kind of
mentioning is like if you have branches
[SPEAKER_00]: growing out of control within that 14
days, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you pretty much answered it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at what point do you add a second layer
of a trellis?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you have your net set,
so you can add in a second layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: When would you add in the second layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would the distance be between the
first layer and the second layer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so if I was the kind of Scrogger
that wanted to have like a double decker
[SPEAKER_01]: Scrog and there's a lot of growers out
there that like to have that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they like to do is they like to fill
their first screen full and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep on talking until everything is
completely full on that screen and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they flip the flower once it's all full
and then they stop talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the difference that I don't do
is I always keep talking when I switch the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't keep talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They now let their plant, their buds rise
up or their colas, their branches start
[SPEAKER_01]: rising up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this time now, they're too like
from the training that they've had,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get a lot of skinnier
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get a lot of those
thick, firm branches because you keep on
[SPEAKER_01]: talking skinnier branches, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ones that are coming up now at the
screen are kind of flimsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not as like strong and sturdy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have to add a second
trellis for support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would recommend it to be around like,
say, six to eight inches off your second
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you flip the flat, once you flip,
because they're probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: around like, say, 12 inch colas all
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're sitting around eight inches,
you're going to be supporting that pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sometimes don't like doing that
because if you don't have a lot of good
[SPEAKER_01]: air movement within that center canopy and
you don't have a lot of good light
[SPEAKER_01]: penetration that's penetrating on those
inner buds, then I just feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's a waste and like now you're
not growing like nice, pure colas off the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're actually just growing branches with
like buds and then like a stick and then a
[SPEAKER_01]: bud down here and maybe a bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all the buds are getting less quality
as you go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is pros and cons to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone has their technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I appreciate all of them,
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just in my mind, I just don't see why
a lot of guys would like to, or girls
[SPEAKER_01]: would like to do the double decker scrubs
just for the reason of like exfoliating
[SPEAKER_01]: the center of it and keeping it clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The airflow and quality of the light
penetrated, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made the mistake of tucking for too
long before I tuck for like the first 14
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that, I didn't get much stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like that was a, that was a mistake
because then everything's kind of flat and
[SPEAKER_00]: your buds are like mixed in within the
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what the heck, I did this
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, that seven day mark that
you do is probably something that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be doing in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't get too much stretch
to where it grows out of control and you
[SPEAKER_00]: need that second layer, but you know,
you just got the 14 days of stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, you know, those,
those buds will hopefully be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: will be even across the canopy and be able
to stay up on their own without that
[SPEAKER_00]: second layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I aim for a six to eight inch colas
off the top of the screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an eight inch cola,
it's going to support itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not going to flop over that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you have fans in your space,
blowing them around, like not blowing them
[SPEAKER_01]: hardcore, but as long as you have air
movement, always moving them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dancing your branches around,
they're going to get, they're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have air movement and they're
just growing in a, in like a still
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and nothing's moving,
they're going to get heavy and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to build muscle and that's by
moving wind, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing is like you just said,
when you, when you struggled and you talk
[SPEAKER_01]: for so long, what happens is, yeah,
you're going to get a bunch of those
[SPEAKER_01]: little buds on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way that I do it is that you'll
see all the, all like the little branches
[SPEAKER_01]: coming up, then you'll see, you'll notice
the ones that are caught and you can snip
[SPEAKER_01]: them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can snip off certain nodes that you
can tell aren't going to make it up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that's another thing if you
want to talk about defoliating,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I get into defoliating and I just
snip off all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I actually was going to ask
you next is do you do any sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliating and adding into that would be
having that net there, it can be difficult
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of get underneath the net to water
the plants or kind of hovering over the
[SPEAKER_00]: net and help be you can see your setup,
you can actually have walk all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: around, but there's a lot of people in
grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you have any tips on defoliating
under and above the net and as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: watering and feeding underneath the net?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you can do is if you're,
if you're someone that is not good at
[SPEAKER_01]: bending down and getting underneath the
screen and like just working in like on
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground, basically you can build a
platform straw kind of like what I have
[SPEAKER_01]: behind me here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can build it on like a table and build
it to your height where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can build them as high as you want,
as long as you have a good ceiling
[SPEAKER_01]: distance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can build it almost to your high
eye level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've helped a lot of people in wheelchairs
build straw frames and they can't stand
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they do is they're build it to
their eye level and they can just stand
[SPEAKER_01]: there and reach in and work on their
plants just by sitting here and reaching
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use like a watering wand to water my
plants nowadays.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stick a little wand in there and I
can just water them easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I use to use a little bucket,
like a little, like a little, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like a little jug, kind of like this jug
right here actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: A jug just like this and I would just
water my plants just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes time doing that and now I
don't have the time just to hand water
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a cool little water wand and
there are a dime a dozen these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a water wand like at Canadian
Tire or Home Depot or wherever,
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever your like local places to shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy them everywhere now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, for defoliating, I like to
defoliate two major times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one week before I flip my plants to
flower, I will defoliate below my screen,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything below my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the leaves that are way tucked under
there, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm stripping all my stems that are being
stripped there if they haven't made the
[SPEAKER_01]: top of the screen yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, I wait a week before
I flip the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do it one week before the flower,
defoliate a lot of stuff under my canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I wait a week, let them heal,
let them heal from that defoliation
[SPEAKER_01]: because it does stress them out a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get back in their groove,
I flip the flower and on day 19,
[SPEAKER_01]: I do another major defoliation on day 19
of flower and I clean up everything below
[SPEAKER_01]: my screen one more time because it all
comes back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do another major cleanup and
that's my two defoliations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during my second defoliation,
I'll look up in my screen and you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: no nodes on the bottom of branches that
you strawed that are trying to wrap around
[SPEAKER_01]: the branch to reach the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those ones just aren't going to quite
make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to snip off a few of
them because they're going to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I just said, they're going to get
bigger right at your screen level,
[SPEAKER_01]: which you don't really want because
they're not as full as the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's going to be a lot of little
node sites that you want to defoliate in
[SPEAKER_01]: your flower defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're sacrificing some of those
branches that aren't going to make it up
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow the six to eight inches above the
net, which is kind of your ideal height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you doing any defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do it towards the end of
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do one last one so light can get
down and ripen the buds, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything around like day 45,
I think is a common day where people do a
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation before harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing major, but I do remove fan leaves
here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a big fan leaf blocking a nice
bud site, I will sometimes take that fan
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf off or sometimes I even like just
take like a fingerling off a fan leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't remove the whole leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just snip off like say the middle
finger of that leaf because sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just a leaf that's rubbing on a bud site
or covering a bud site and I'll take off
[SPEAKER_01]: just that little fingerling of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I do is I do walk around
and remove fan leaves here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: tuck them under my screen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can tuck a fan leaf, I'll tuck it
under my screen before I remove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's always those little once in a
while, pluck a fan leaf here and there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but nothing major.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just did two major defoliations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One week before and 19 days after I flip.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to back up for a second because
I thought of a question that should have
[SPEAKER_00]: been asked a little while ago,
which is positioning the plant underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned that you typically run
four plants underneath the net,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you also mentioned that when you're
training, you're letting that plant grow
[SPEAKER_00]: up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're doing that one bend
towards the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you positioning the plant directly
underneath like the center of the net?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to explain this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like are you positioning towards more like
towards the corner so that plant can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outwards towards the center?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting close there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I should have elaborated a bit more of
when I top my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do top my plants once.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I do bend that main top over,
eventually I'll get to that top,
[SPEAKER_01]: say after I transplant it, a couple of
weeks after I transplant it, I'll top that
[SPEAKER_01]: main stock that's growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't top it to create two new tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those tops, they're already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not creating two new tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just two nodes below that top,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm going to, what I'm going to do
now by topping is those two new nodes or
[SPEAKER_01]: nodes that are exposed are now going to
grow and they're not going to be as firm
[SPEAKER_01]: and stiff as the top that I just topped
off, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that main stock is always going to
be thicker in the side branches that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main one is always going to be thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I top that main one just so I can have
flexibility and work the two new branches
[SPEAKER_01]: into my straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you were, when you said I top and
direct that top somewhere, I don't do that
[SPEAKER_01]: because eventually that becomes two and
they split off in their own direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do is I position my plants
under my frame so they have enough space
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up and turn into a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to keep it so they have enough
space on every side of each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: of like the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So against my frame here, it has to have
enough space here as it does on this side
[SPEAKER_01]: of my frame beside this plant here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see that mistake a lot in my,
in my Scroggers group, people positioning
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants on the side of their frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the plant grows up, they have all
this room to talk over here, but now
[SPEAKER_01]: they're already running out of space here
because they positioned their plant too
[SPEAKER_01]: far into the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you definitely want to give your plants
room to become like a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you got a vision in your head
is that plant becoming a mushroom in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot about like future visualize
visualization really, like when it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: to Scroggie, you got a picture like when
it's going to be in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you got to think of a big
mushroom happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard anybody say it like that,
but it makes sense and you can visualize
[SPEAKER_00]: once you say mushroom, you can certainly
visualize how it'll be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now harvesting, you already said one tip,
which I think is fantastic, which is you
[SPEAKER_00]: cut the twine and then you basically just
pull out the twine and then are you just
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting from the base to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you cutting individual branches?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get caught up because
they're using nets and things get
[SPEAKER_00]: intertwined, you know, and it's difficult
to remove the branch because you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: net there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So backing up, do you have any like just
general advice for harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the way I honestly harvest is I,
what I said is like, yeah, I cut all the
[SPEAKER_01]: twine on just two sides of my frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pull it all out and then I do,
I cut right from the base of my plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I cut individual branches from
the main stalk of the branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just start cutting big branches off
because I want, now I want to like open up
[SPEAKER_01]: my plant as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I, when you scrog, you're always like
kind of close together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to get air movement,
but it's not like, it's real dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get air movement happening
everywhere around these, around my buds
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I cut them into like just nice
big individual branches, hang them all
[SPEAKER_01]: inside a tent or inside a nice room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I let them hang just like that
individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't hang, I don't hang just big
scrog plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely cut them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long do you dry for and what are your
drying conditions, temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep my temperature anywhere
from like say 60 to 64 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_01]: and anywhere from like say 60 to like,
or I should say like from 58 to 63 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: or percent humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I will, I'll let them hang up in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I keep those conditions in that
environment, they can sit there for as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as they want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause pretty much they're going to be
curing themselves in those conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I like, like first I'll,
okay, I should go back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I do harvest, I take off the big
fan leaves right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll break down into individual
branches, take off those big, huge fan
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves that I don't want, but I'll leave
like the little sugar leaves is what
[SPEAKER_01]: people call them, sugar leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave them on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hang all the branches and then
I go back about, I'll go back like say
[SPEAKER_01]: eight days, nine days later, and I'll do
another dry trim, just trim off all my
[SPEAKER_01]: branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, I'm usually like, I have a nice
environment that I dry in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not in a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go right up into my space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can sit there at a desk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just keep on hanging them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I let my plants cure in the
environment that I hang them as drying
[SPEAKER_01]: right after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You letting them cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're, you're going through the dry
period, but then they're just continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: on through the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Curing for and when do you put them into
containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I'll let, I'll hang them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them hang up there for like,
I've had them hang up there for like over
[SPEAKER_01]: two months before, like as long as it's
dark and it's, it's at the right
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them sit up there for as long as
they want until I need that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll jar them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But particularly what I want to do is I'll
leave them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I had to like, if I had to like
get going, I leave them in there for at
[SPEAKER_01]: least say 14 days, hanging up there,
drying in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would jar them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I would burp them every single
day for at least say probably half an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would get the humidity packs to put
in my jars that like probably like 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity just to keep it safe in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, like I always found that it
works out just to keep them in my space
[SPEAKER_01]: that I keep nice and cold and a nice
humidity and they cure in there for me
[SPEAKER_01]: just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever tried using those Grove
bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used the Grove bags before too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like them, but I honestly like I do
prefer the jar method.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to pick a method, I'd probably go
back to the jar method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do the Grove bags quite 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to do, you're supposed to
like heat seal the top of the rim,
[SPEAKER_01]: like of the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't, I didn't do that state,
that step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't really like get my opinion on
them fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did, I did like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they, they probably did their
job, but I might have left them in the bag
[SPEAKER_01]: too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that you want to leave
in there for a very extended long period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to let them kind of cure and then
take them out of that bag and put them
[SPEAKER_01]: into like jars or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my, that was my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I didn't heat seal the
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might've messed it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually just got the Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, I forget what video I was on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was on the from the stash
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have another podcast and we talked
about it and the comments were just
[SPEAKER_00]: flooded with people that are like jars are
outdated.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone use good Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what the heck are these
Grove bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went out and bought some and I just
started using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really have an opinion on them
yet, but it sounds like a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's supposedly you, you put your
dried bud in there and then it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it cures itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to burp it all apparently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of cures in the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need to open up the bag or
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm definitely gonna have to try
that out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using it as storage right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to see particularly,
I live in a very dry climate and I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it's sucking out the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people had said that they live in dry
climates and their humidity, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: their bud turns, it crumbles up over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to prevent, obviously prevent
that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I just wanted to get your
opinion on them on the Grove bags since
[SPEAKER_00]: they seem to be a hot product here in
2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you heat seal the top of your bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I just, just sealed up the bag with
the, and then put it into maximum.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wine fridge, I have it set to 60
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually I did put a pack in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put some of those humidity packs in some
of them and I put the, I didn't put
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity packs in other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna kind of see the difference on
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well I did, I actually talked with
the Grove bag, like the manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: like right at the company themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I met, I met some guy at some conference
and he told me that he highly recommends
[SPEAKER_01]: that you need to heat seal that top of
those rims.
[SPEAKER_01]: It even says that you have to heat seal
those for them to work the way that they
[SPEAKER_01]: are designed to, or else they will let
that dry air into the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to like, you need to heat,
if you want to really do a proper test,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to heat seal it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he said to me was, use your
girlfriend's hair straightener and just go
[SPEAKER_01]: and just clamp it on the bag and just warm
it up a little bit and it'll stay tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, man, like I'll try it my
next round, but I'm not going to go do
[SPEAKER_01]: that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, he said, he said you got to heat
seal them or it's not going to do what you
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was doing it wrong, but let's get
back to the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have like one more question and then
we can kind of wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are trying to do the Scrog
technique specifically for yield purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever measured yield when doing
the Scrog technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do you have like a yield per square
foot or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I used to measure yield when I was
younger, when I was actually growing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for the reason of gaining like quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ever since probably say like the last
10 years, I don't even, I don't even weigh
[SPEAKER_01]: my harvest anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I can say is like, I used to
always use a five by five screen and I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to always roll four plants under it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I typically would get say like eight
ounces per plant on a two month veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be like over a pound per pound per
run on my five by five frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always get over a pound per run
out of four plants over a two month veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the longer that you've vegged,
the bigger your yield will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my mind nowadays, the bigger your
yield, the less your quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I just feel like the bigger the
plant is and the bigger the buds are,
[SPEAKER_01]: the less quality is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always, now I find that my smaller
plants are actually more potent and more
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful and more dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just smoke a lot better compared
to my big, huge plants that yield like say
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 ounces per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But look at like, it just doesn't smoke
that nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just feels like it just got like,
just fed a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, it's just not as nice as my
little plants that only veg for two months
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's just where I came to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but with that being said, like,
you're definitely going to probably yield
[SPEAKER_01]: a bit more scrogging than you would
typically off a normal kind of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only because you're going to be
growing top dense colas on your screen and
[SPEAKER_01]: every bud you have is going to be a top
cola that has density to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of plants, a lot of ways that people
grow is they'll have a lot of bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a lot of those lower buds are not
going to be dense and they're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be that much quality to it because it's
going to be fluffy bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I just find that with the way
that I scrog, I have about 70 top colas
[SPEAKER_01]: per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the average, 70 top colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all about like say around six
to eight inches tall and they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I definitely yield a lot off one
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't measure it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not there to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there just to enjoy it myself and my
family really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree that there's definitely a balance
between yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we back up for a second,
quality is so subjective, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality to me can be different to you,
to the next grower, to the next grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people might think that non-dense
buds are quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be quality to them,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The area stuff, that might be quality to
them and they might say, the dense stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't good quality, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was what I found because in the
comments section, it's just people debate
[SPEAKER_00]: about it all day long on what's quality
and what's not quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people love flowers,
that foxtail with like so much foxtails on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see the trichome production on the
foxtail, but like I wouldn't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like foxtails so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a nice indica density flower
compared to like a sativa foxtail plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, yeah, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everyone has their own preference,
even in styles that they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, everyone has preferences in
every way they do things in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and they all work really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything works as long as it works for
you.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like today, talking about the
scrub technique, I mean, this is just one
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your style of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a whole bunch of other
people that do it differently than the way
[SPEAKER_00]: you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not really a right or wrong,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just, it's a different way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that actually brings up a question for
the folks tuning into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do the scrub technique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments, how do you do
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do it the same way that Troy does
it, or do you do it differently?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to hear your techniques down in
the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other things about the scrub
technique that we missed, or do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: any general advice for new gardeners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for, yeah, for new gardeners,
one thing that I always try to tell every
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them is don't overwater your
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you first start growing,
that's one of the main things that people
[SPEAKER_01]: mess up on is just overwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watering their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants don't need to be overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your little plants let those pots dry
out before you add more water to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really important step for a new
grower because that's what I stumbled upon
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first started a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone I teach, they stumble upon
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drown their plants, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the scrub technique, the only
thing that I can advise people if you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to try this out is to build your frames on
a platform or even on the ground if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you need to build it to make yourself
have accessibility around it and able to
[SPEAKER_01]: work on your frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a four by four tent and it
only has one door in that tent,
[SPEAKER_01]: you might not want to scrog the way I do
because you're going to need to get to the
[SPEAKER_01]: side of it and you might need to get
behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of tents have two doors,
so that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can buy tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have tents that have like,
it has one main door and then two side
[SPEAKER_01]: doors that flap down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can work on each sides with a
front.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to access at least
three sides of your scrub.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important for anyone who wants to
get into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want to make your screen sides
comfortable for you to work on with your
[SPEAKER_01]: hands and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, right now I have something really
exciting happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I started something called Scrog
School happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little series that is going to be
called Scrog School.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already done two episodes of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now it's going to start getting
in the interest in times because I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting coming up now and start
doing the training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every Thursday at seven o'clock p.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eastern Standard Time, I go live in this
room and I have cameras positioned
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere in this room, like high
definition cameras.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just sit here and we like teach how
to scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach you, I show you how to do it with
my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's Scrog School.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Facebook page called Scroggers,
you can find me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of good Scroggers on that
page.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in Scrogging,
just go over to Facebook, type in
[SPEAKER_01]: Scroggers.
[SPEAKER_01]: A group will come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 65,000 members in there and they
all love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like post Scrogs every day,
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's my two major spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram, I'm like the Northern Scrogger
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see my pictures of Scrogs,
I'm all about Scrogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I eat, breathe and sleep Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely sounds like you have some
exciting things upcoming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to your
YouTube channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're tuning in on one of the
podcast platforms, just search for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find them.
