[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Grostar S600 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to unbox the unit
and also test the power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually had several requests of
people wanting to see more budget LEDs,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think this light really fits into
that category.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see more budget LEDs on
this channel, hit that thumbs up button
[SPEAKER_00]: and let me know in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I purchased this grow light off of Amazon
at a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently it looks like there is a $10
dollar off coupon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure how long this will last,
but I did want to point that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it arrived to my house, it of course
came in an Amazon box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I opened up the Amazon box,
there was a box with the LED grow light in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upon opening the box, the first thing here
is the instruction manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This instruction manual has a ton of
various information such as safety
[SPEAKER_00]: information, specifications on the grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has three additional models on top of
that which it talks about and compares.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lists what the power output is,
what the spectrum looks like, and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: warranty terms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next out the box is the power cord,
one ratchet hanger, one wire hanger,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then of course the LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to know the specific features
about this grow light, I will link it in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This measures from 389nm to 692nm plus or
minus 5nm and measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just going to give you a general
idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am taking measurements in a grow tent
which has reflective walls so that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The user manual says this has a coverage
area of 9 feet by 8 feet and the Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: listing says it has a core coverage area
of 5.2 feet by 4.9 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those must be incorrect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lights this size are best suited for a 2
foot by 2 foot grow space in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've placed the light in a 2 foot by 4
foot grow tent and I have the light on one
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the grow tent and I'll be sure to
keep the meter on one side so measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: are taken in a 2 foot by 2 foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be taking measurements at 3 different
distances, 12 inches away, 18 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 24 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see what these measurements look
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I have left a link to this grow
light in the description section below so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can find out more information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
