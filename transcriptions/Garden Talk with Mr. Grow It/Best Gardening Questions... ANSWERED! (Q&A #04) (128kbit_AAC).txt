[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a guest in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Max.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to sit in on my lap every once in
a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I needed to record this video and he just
plopped right down, so you're gonna be a
[SPEAKER_00]: part of it, bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am back at it again with another Q&A
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the second week in a row that I am
releasing a Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like these types of videos,
make sure you hit that thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be an indicator of whether or
not I should record more of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any questions that you
want me to answer within one of these Q&A
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, make sure you list them down in
the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't guarantee that I'll read your
question off in an episode, but I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly go down there and cherry-pick
the best ones that I think will be
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable for more than just one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's just get right into the
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you empty the runoff or do you let the
plants sit in the runoff?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on if I'm growing with
organic inputs or if I'm growing
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetically with bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing with organic nutrients,
what I'll do is I'll water and then if
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a little bit of runoff,
I'll let it soak up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I feel like I've accidentally
overwatered, then you know, maybe I'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: rid of it, but I try to avoid doing that
at all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is because there's
beneficial bacteria, fungi, organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: in that runoff, so I'm disposing of it is
arguably waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when I'm growing with synthetic
nutrients, any runoff that I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do about 10 to 20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've let it sit in there in the past
and let it soaked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, a salt buildup can occur
and it can ultimately lead to nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: lockout, plant control deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll water in until there's about 10 to
20% runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I use a shop vac to dispose of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain your shirt, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made sure to wear the shirt gram per
watt with a big X on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those of you who don't know what
gram per watt is, it's basically a
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement that some growers use in order
to determine for the watts that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming, what is the yield they're
getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using a hundred watt grow
light and you're getting a hundred gram
[SPEAKER_00]: dry yield, that's one gram per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going with a 300 watt grow light
and you're getting 300 grams of yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one gram per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going with a 300 watt grow light
and you're getting 600 grams of yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's two grams per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually seen this measurement being
used by lighting companies in order to try
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell their lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main reason why I am against
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well known that light isn't the only
thing that determines yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different factors that
go into it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment is going to go into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nutrition, genetics is going to go into
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several different things that
is going to determine yield for a lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: company to say that if you purchase this
light, you're going to get two grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion is misleading.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can get a high yielding strain
and have a half decent light and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher gram per watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And saying that it's the light that's
doing it, again, is just misleading your
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the calculation can be somewhat
confusing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What wattage do you actually use?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a hundred watts in the
vegetation stage, seedling stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetation stage, and you're slowly
increasing that wattage into flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: what wattage do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use the veg wattage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use the flower wattage?
[SPEAKER_00]: If the argument that you're using the
flower wattage will then you're not using
[SPEAKER_00]: that same wattage throughout the entire
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So should you actually be using that
flower wattage or should you be keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: track of the weeks that you're using a
hundred watts, the weeks that you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: 200 watts, 300 watts, et cetera,
and then averaging that out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're using a lower wattage in
veg and then you're using higher wattage
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower and then you're just using that
higher wattage as a calculation,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be shooting yourself in the foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe that this can be used as a
personal benchmark so you can measure kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of your own performance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using the same grow setup or if
you're just changing one thing at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to measure your own
performance, sure, you can do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there are so many variables that go
into yield, you know, like I had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if I see lighting companies that
are advertising a gram per watt claiming
[SPEAKER_00]: that their light is going to give them a
certain gram per watt, I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: usually avoid companies that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any recommendations on organic furs for
top dressing during veg and flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different organic
amendments that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use Earth Dust by the Green
Sunshine Company, but there are several
[SPEAKER_00]: others out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Dr. Earth, you've got Down to
Earth, Mr. B's Trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several organic blends that can
be used throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of these organic blends,
they'll come with a feeding chart or some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of feeding instructions which tell
you how to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Question of the day, I want to grow a
bunch of, how would I do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a loaded question.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was trying to maximize yield growing
indoors, I would grow in the largest room
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would make sure I have sufficient
lighting that covers the entire area that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd make sure that the plants are getting
the optimal amount of PAR, optimal amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of CO2, and I would chase after VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would of course make sure that the plant
is healthy throughout the entire grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper nutrition is certainly key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when growing the plant,
I would do training in order to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: maximize that space as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trellis net is one of the ones that I
would probably use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would top the plants,
do low stress training, and just make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: every square inch of that footprint is
completely full in order to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last thing would be I would
grow cultivars that are advertised as
[SPEAKER_00]: high-yielders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened to NVCMG?
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't seen anything from him in months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the previous video that he commented
on, I was wearing NV closet Medgro's
[SPEAKER_00]: shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who follow him on
YouTube know that he hasn't really posted
[SPEAKER_00]: much lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually used to live in Las Vegas and
we've hung out on a few occasions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, unfortunately, he actually moved
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's in Colorado now, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: His content on YouTube was extremely
valuable to me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just learned so much from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his brain is like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: He learns so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: He knows so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, definitely miss him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I definitely hope he comes back to
YouTube soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What PPM of feed do you use for the
different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I've actually listed in
my book under the PPM section in the book.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who don't know,
I have a book specifically for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing Indoors in Soil or Coca-Cola.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a section on PPM which has a
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put it on the screen right now so you
can see what I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But after sprout, vegetation, or seedling
stages for the first week, 100 to 250 PPM
[SPEAKER_00]: is what I target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetation weeks 2 to 3, 300 to 400 PPM is
what I target.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veg weeks 4 and beyond, 450 to 700 PPM
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending if it's larger plants,
it can go higher than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers weeks 1 through 4, 750 to 950.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers weeks 5 plus, 1000 to 1600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some feedos are going to be able to take
more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some feedos are going to be sensitive
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not take as much as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just kind of a general range that
I go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly you can deviate from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, this is taking
measurements on a 500 scale TDS tester.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see 2 weeks before
harvest, less than a 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is if you believe in flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of controversy behind
flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new studies have come out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: General range, you know, you don't have to
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to flush, you know,
aim for around 100 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just general guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, you should see some fade on
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, get those fall colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So liquid cool bloom is an additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll use your base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this is an additive on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recharge is a microbial inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it actually has kelp and molasses
in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can absolutely use both of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many times can you reuse soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing organically,
you can reuse soil infinite number of
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not aware of how to do that,
there are plenty of resources on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet on reusing soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're using synthetic bottled
nutrients, generally it's recommended to
[SPEAKER_00]: not reuse your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why is because salt can build
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that can lead to lockout
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have an imbalance of nutrients that
can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can definitely get poor
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know a lot of my friends that use
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just throw away their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when I was using bottled
nutrients, I was throwing on my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty wasteful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's another positive of going
organic is you can reuse your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the best tips to get really rock
hard buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it as much in the cure as it is
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: A combination of all maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I definitely think it is a
combination of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting with genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe look at people who are growing those
genetics online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it look like a dense bud structure?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely genetics out there
that don't dense up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of naturally, I don't want to
say airy, but definitely not a super dense
[SPEAKER_00]: bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are also plants that
foxtail.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just in their genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely start with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then environment is going to be a huge
factor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the proper humidity levels,
for example, if you're chasing after VPD,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're trying to aim to achieve VPD
through all levels of growth, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a better bud structure than if you
were living in dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the desert region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown plants in very dry conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 25% RH, 30% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think that has impacted the
bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure your environment is dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a combination of things
in order to get that rock hard bud
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I ask you a question?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a first time grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And have three sprouts of ultra auto power
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out fast by day two.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had popped and stretched a bit,
but by day five, they seem to have
[SPEAKER_00]: stalled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just tested my soil pH and it's high at
7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will that slow them down?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, how can I fix it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off the first week that that
plant sprouts from the medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: that seedling stage, growth is going to
appear very slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might just be that plant
establishing its root structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may not see rapid growth start to
happen until we know two, three and
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it has more leafs, it's able to
intake more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned your soil pH is high at
7.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could potentially be locking some
nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next time around you may just want
to water in at a lower pH, maybe at like
[SPEAKER_00]: 6.2 to 6.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should naturally kind of drop down.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you asked it because there have
been multiple people have hit me up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past and they're very concerned about that
first week because they don't see much
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just give it time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain plant stretch in detail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're talking about plant
stretch while the plant is a seedling or
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're talking about plant stretch
during the first several weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when a plant first pops its head from
the medium, you could see it stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most common reason why that happens is
because the light is too far away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stretching up, reaching for that
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it could very well also be the
spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's high in red spectrum,
it doesn't have a lot of blue in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will see longer internode spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be a contributing factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now talking about plant stretch when we
get into the flowering stage, once you
[SPEAKER_00]: change that light cycle over to 12-12,
for example, the flowering light cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant will continue to grow upwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what growers often refer to as
the stretching phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the cultivar you're
growing, some plants could stretch three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some could stretch two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenos are going to stretch more than
others, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some cultivars you might see a plant
stretch barely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other phenos you might see stretch to
double its height.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was when you flipped it to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some phenos could be even more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, I just grew out square one
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Tahoe G crossed with banana
buttercups and that stretched to three
[SPEAKER_00]: times the amount after flipping to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So genetics is going to be the main thing
that determines how much that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: stretches, assuming that your
environment's dialed in, nutrition's
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the questions that I have for
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a question that you want me to
answer in a future episode, leave them
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one more thing before I end this
