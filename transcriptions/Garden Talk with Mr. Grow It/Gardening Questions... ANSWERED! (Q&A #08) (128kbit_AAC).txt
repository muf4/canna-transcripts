[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka MrGrowIt, and I'm back with
[SPEAKER_00]: another Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Q&A video I actually did live on
Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twitch is a live streaming platform that's
mostly known for gaming, but they also do
[SPEAKER_00]: IRL and just chatting live streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made an announcement on my Instagram
and on Twitter to head on over there and
[SPEAKER_00]: ask questions, and I've got a ton of good
questions that I'm answering in this
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to join me in the next Q&A
video and ask questions that could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially be featured in a future video,
check me out at twitch.tv slash MrGrowIt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you hit the follow button,
it should turn on notifications,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you'll be notified when I go live
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the episode,
I just want to give a quick shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: our sponsor for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mars Hydro for sponsoring this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro has two new LED grow lights,
the FC8000 and the FCE8000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both grow lights are 800 watts and will
work great in a 4x4 or 5x5 grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FC8000 has two versions, one with
Samsung LM301B diodes and one with Samsung
[SPEAKER_00]: LM301H diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the bars are detachable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FCE8000 has Bridgelux diodes,
and there are more diodes for a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Link to their website is in the
description section below, and you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: coupon code MRGROWIT for a discount on
their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noob question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started seeing my plant flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much longer, in your opinion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it depends on genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you could have a strain that does 8
weeks in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have one that does 9 weeks in
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cultivars that go up to,
I think, 13 weeks in flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is the longest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can get an auto-flowering strain,
which is going to be a little bit less
[SPEAKER_00]: than that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could potentially get a 7-weeker
that's an auto-flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it really all depends on what your
genetics is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at Seed Finder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Search Seed Finder in Google.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you go on there, enter in the
cultivar that you're working with,
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivar or strain that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to find the breeder and
those genetics, and then also be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how long it's in flowering for,
whether it's an 8-week, 9-week,
[SPEAKER_00]: 10-week flowering strain or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will we see some videos like your old
videos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my old videos are pretty cringy,
if you ask me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have released a video on my main channel
quite recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this year, I've only released four
videos on that channel, but all of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe all of them have been grow
updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, all four videos have been like
updates in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting up with just more topic-based
videos, to be completely honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really really time-consuming to make
videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me in particular, the old videos that
you're referring to, I would write a
[SPEAKER_00]: script for the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would film the footage, write a script,
record the audio for the script,
[SPEAKER_00]: cut down the audio, overlay the videos,
add in effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a very time-consuming process to
do those types of videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I'm kind of over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of moving on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to take a page out of Pigeon's Book
and just be more simplified with the
[SPEAKER_00]: videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get back into the groove of
one video per week on my main channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: so stick around for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my time has been occupied by
podcasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have my garden talk with Mr.
Grow It podcast from the Stash podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: so those have just been taking up a lot of
my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also now I'm back in school,
so talk a little bit about the breeders
[SPEAKER_00]: you prefer or trust for new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeders I trust, so number one,
square one genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is just off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Square one genetics I trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust Prism Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I trust Subcool Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcool is the dank, I believe it was what
it's called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rest in peace, Subcool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some amazing genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a huge list of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is just off the top of my
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of all the ones that
I've grown in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: TH seeds is another one that I trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that pretty much answers the
question for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about topping auto
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to top auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I've done it, I feel like I've
gotten less yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it's impossible to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have two auto flower plants of the
same cultivar growing side by side,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're coming from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different phenos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you top one and let the other one grow,
it's not really a fair comparison because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're different phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it just seems like for me,
anytime I topped an auto, I just haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten as good of a yield as when I don't
top autos and just do low stress training,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for autos, the highest yield I've ever
got was from a plant that I did just low
[SPEAKER_00]: stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: No topping, no super cropping or anything
I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Carmelicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was by MSNL Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got eight ounces off of that one plant,
one auto flower just with low stress
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely one of the ones that just
think low stress training is enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do 72 hours of darkness before
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no studies out there right
now proving the point, but I've talked to
[SPEAKER_00]: so many people about this, people who know
about plant physiology and know about how
[SPEAKER_00]: tricone production works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just look at my last garden talk
with Mr. Grove podcast with Tim McCormick
[SPEAKER_00]: from Culture Biologics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him the question about darkness
before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually, I think he answers that
question before I could ask it to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of one of those things
that's hard to measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: As of right now, it's bro science until
actual science were to come out on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I've really seen it in
much of a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of looks like there's more
tricones on there, but like that's just me
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's not going to be harmful
to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if like I put my lights off,
keep my lights off, maybe I'm busy and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay with leaving that plant and 48
hours, 72 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that plan is going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to ruin the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I have time, I'll go and
I'll harvest it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I do the 72 hours of
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to show your freak show
update?
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: We chose one of the my favorites to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've grown it before, how granny
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Update on that coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that don't know, I actually be
posting that in my MJ BizCon vlog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got two freak show cuts from
Humboldt Seat Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that don't know a freak
show, just Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super excited to grow that one
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got two cuts directly from the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So directly from Humboldt Seat Co.
[SPEAKER_00]: at MJ BizCon 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: I walked up to the booth and I was just
filming them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden the guy taps me on the
shoulder and he's like, you want to cut a
[SPEAKER_00]: freak show?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, wait, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he had, they had like,
I think three or four huge freak show
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were just cutting off clones for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a clone of that and like two
clones of that actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of them rooted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely be giving you guys an
update on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I happen to have a guaranteed femme
producing nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole crow is pollinated, but I pluck
them off the sex in the lower buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the bigger buds still produce?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how far along are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to hear that shark.
[SPEAKER_00]: How far along are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would really depend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So say that you're an early flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally would probably kill off the
plant if it was like week four or earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's week five, I try to pluck off the
nanners and hope that they don't continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see I've had plants where nanners would
just produce like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you would pluck off some,
but like you'd come back the next day and
[SPEAKER_00]: there would be twice as many as before.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've also had plants where I only had
a couple of nanners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you pluck off those few nanners the
next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might spot one or two more,
but it's like you can manage it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now keep in mind when the plant exposes
nanners, it's immediately releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any plants that you have in that same
growth space, it's getting pollinated nine
[SPEAKER_00]: times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got an oscillating fan on
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that pollen is released, it's so
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's blowing around that growth space is a
very good chance that it has pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now does that mean that you're going to be
loaded with seeds and all of your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because it's just one nanner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the amount of pollen there isn't
going to really destroy your crop in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was like week five, week six,
I would try to definitely pluck them off
[SPEAKER_00]: and then hope that they fatten up and
produce, ripen up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hopefully you can, you can
salvage that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, great question here from organic butt
flap.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing organic, do you prefer hot
soil and water only or light soil with
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of top dressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some things to consider when
making that decision?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, super soil is one of those
things where, yeah, try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you can amend the soil and balance
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend talking to somebody like the
soil doctor when you're adding amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to get the right ratios of
nutrients in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally not a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't, I don't really try to take
different amendments and then make my own
[SPEAKER_00]: super soil and hope that it works out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if there's an imbalance in any of
these elements in there, some can lock
[SPEAKER_00]: others out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an excess of some, you're going to
see deficiency in others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even play around when it comes
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy like an organic bagged soil,
I do like to do that at minimum,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Fox farm ocean forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of you guys know I use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's soil that is going to come with
nutrients in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to last you, you know,
30, 40 days, you know, so depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: much you plant transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, in theory, that would be a
little bit easier than buying a,
[SPEAKER_00]: a, a blank soil, let's say, and then
adding amendments in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So buying the bagged soil, you save a
little bit of time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then add to the top dressing,
top dressing before flipping the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and the top dressing again, like 20 to 30
days in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so 20 to 30 days after that first
track dressing is when I do the second top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's mostly what I do is just buy
the, the bagged soil for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been reusing soil as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just, just reamending and top
dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, either way I've done them both
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some things to consider when making that
decision, just really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much time do you want to spend doing
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, because you have to do a little
bit of research and then also buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments, all the different amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to make your own super soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wondering what issues can happen if I have
to dry in a room with light, trying to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what options I have limited to a small
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So light is going to degrade the trichomes
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cause your, your trichomes
to continue to mature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: From the clear cloudy and then amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, at least that's what it said,
or at least it's, it's from, maybe it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just the THC to the amber, but it degrades
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how long it takes for that to
be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody knows how long,
I don't know if anybody's measured that if
[SPEAKER_00]: we have the science on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but generally speaking, it degrades
the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to dry in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't, could you still dry in light
nine times out of 10?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you could ruin some trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger thing to worry about is the
actual temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're drying, keeping
around 60% humidity, 60 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, try to get that temperature
low.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher the temperature, the more
terpenes are going to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to be drying in a room
with light, I'm assuming maybe you're
[SPEAKER_00]: drying in your grow room that gets 70,
80 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not ideal for drying, but Hey,
if you, that's the only thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only thing you can do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you top your photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do top my photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, typically I'll, I mean,
I've done so many different ways topped at
[SPEAKER_00]: the third node, top to the fourth node,
top to the fifth node, let it grow to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fifth node, drop top down to the fourth
node.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways you can go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, topping at the fourth or fifth node,
just doing that one top and then leaving
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower branches to grow up and pulling
them out and keeping an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a ton of branches with just
that one topping at the fifth node,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's new to topping,
just want to try it out for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time, top at the fifth node, let all those
branches kind of grow up, continue to do
[SPEAKER_00]: those low, low stress trainings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a branch is kind of coming up and
dominating, bring it down so the other
[SPEAKER_00]: branches can grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have all those lower branches
growing up and they're an even canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get yourself a nice plant that's
going to yield high.
[SPEAKER_00]: When's the earliest we can visually sex
our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So coming from seed, you're going to as
early as 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to take a seed,
plant it directly into your medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: immediately put it on the 12, 12 light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flowering light cycle to where
phytochrome, uh, PR, which is the awake
[SPEAKER_00]: state is not accumulating as much as PFR,
which is kind of the night state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Florigen will start to accumulate,
which is a flowering hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it will start to flower,
but the plant needs to spend it's 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is my testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've done 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first saw a pistol, so I'd have to do it
for multiple plants to be sure 21 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the earliest I'd ever caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody in the chat has
caught any earlier, so keeping an eye on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 12 light cycle from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen pistols any earlier than
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the start of flowering any
earlier than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use build a soil products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use their craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build soil, craft blend is what I've been
using a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of my grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their build a flower top dress kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their diatomaceous earth,
which I haven't used yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do use their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the PPM be measured before watering,
you could, yeah, I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take a look at my PPM before just to
get an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for example, last night when I
measured the PPM was like 600.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also took when I fed the
plants, took the runoff measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: because nutrients are going to build up,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like they're going through 100%
of the nutrients from the last time
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever the last time around
measurement was, you got to figure that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant has eaten through some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus if you're organics, some amendments
have broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that number is always changing what
your PPM number is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could take a look at your initial
PPM measurement and take a look at your
[SPEAKER_00]: last measurement and say, okay,
last time it was a thousand PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming it's going to eat up to 300
over the last three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to feed in 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be in my range between a
thousand and 1500.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's a total guessing game when
it comes to this whole piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really, these are just general
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like they said, it mentioned my
book, my, my range, I believe is a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand to, I want to say 1600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody said 1500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it said 1600 in the book in
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had some plants that were able to
take more without getting nutrient burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had plants that weren't as
hungry, didn't need to be fed as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be on the lower side of that
thousand or even a little bit less than
[SPEAKER_00]: that thousand PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've been fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like this whole PPM thing is
definitely a guessing game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tuning into this Q and a video
on the outro card here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The video on the left is the previous Q
and a video that I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the video on the right is
automatically generated by the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shh.
