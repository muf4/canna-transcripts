[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing well, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on to the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to have you on, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen you in the chat like so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you're all over the place,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You always have good input and you're very
supportive of the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate you coming on
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate that, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you guys are awesome,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to follow you guys and support you
guys as much as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, the other two guys, you know,
from the Stash Crew and then also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all the AC Infinity people,
it's just an amazing community you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: were building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciate you letting me
come on here and jab with you for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it should be a good conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking about your
method of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to get into that because I
think a lot of people are going more
[SPEAKER_01]: towards a more simplified approach to
nutrition, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Feeding a lot of people going from
synthetic to organic because they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be more hands-off as one of the reasons
why other benefits of Shure, we could sit
[SPEAKER_01]: here and talk for the next 15 minutes
about the benefits of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we won't get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into your style of
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so actually, I kind of got the same
story everybody else does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started, you know, partaking in the
medical plant around the age 14,
[SPEAKER_00]: 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in that time, the
oppression was very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very hard to get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided one day I was going to grow
some and just like everybody else,
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom found it, killed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, that killed my drive
for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, as I become an adult,
I was like, I really think I can do that,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially, you know, with all the
gardening experience that I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up, you know, in Alabama,
there's a lot of gardening, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: farmland.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like built into my culture
or to my background, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of comes natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's a plant, you know,
essentially a weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do it, you know, where you only
have to add water, it takes the guesswork
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you put yourself on a schedule
when you want to add your amendments to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crazy part about all of this is
the people that you buy the amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: from give you their take on how you should
mix it, how you should add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you follow that, and you put it in a
calendar, it's very, very easy,
[SPEAKER_00]: very easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you say your overall growth
style is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in like soil or cocoa or
hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoors, outdoors, organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, organic all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to call myself a control freak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to be in control of all the
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you start with a soil that has really
nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can add your own, make your own
magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the crazy part about
organics is they it's a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this works off of this, this works off
of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you figure out what this,
this, and this is, and you put it all
[SPEAKER_00]: together, all you have to do is add water
and you just sit back and watch your magic
[SPEAKER_00]: happen, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there's an environmental
situation that you have to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, there's no
guessing, there's no mixing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get somebody brand new to
this and they're like, oh, I want to try
[SPEAKER_00]: the latest, you know, Athena blend where I
have to mix everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their plants come out and they blame
it on Athena, but no, they've,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've never done it before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know exactly what they're
getting themselves into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, you take all the
guesswork out of it and you only add
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's really, there's,
there's not another way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're starting off with pretty much
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of talk about what is in your
soil mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, pro mix HP, that's my go-to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because there's no, there's not really
anything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there is my Karazi in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the, as far as the amendments go,
it's kind of, kind of naked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you start, you know, adding your
own, uh, your own amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like guy green, um, simply because
Mr. Canucks kind of taught me everything I
[SPEAKER_00]: know about the organic method,
you know, so I stayed true to guy green,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, the amendments that I use are the
four, four, four, uh, and the three,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I do, you know, per per bag,
I can't remember exactly how much is in
[SPEAKER_00]: each bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I believe it's three tablespoons,
you know, when you first start making your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil is three tablespoons per gallon of
soil, um, of each kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you, you only add
your, your bloom, you know, during your,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, flower stage, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, you add your, um,
two, eight, four.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I had both of those, you know,
initially when I first started mixing my
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, uh, at the very beginning and then,
uh, during, and vegetative stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: it states on there, you know, only add a
tablespoon every four weeks of the two
[SPEAKER_00]: eight four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I actually, I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during each, during each top dressing,
I add a tablespoon of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every four weeks, my soil gets a
tablespoon of each of the guy green
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I just mix it in, you know,
uh, and then from there it's, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: stash blend every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stash blend, you know, probably from
week two, uh, all the way up to the very
[SPEAKER_00]: end, uh, minus the last two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just started doing the last two
weeks of taking the stash blend out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, simply because, uh, Rob actually says
something about recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I picked up a little bit of recharge
and the last couple of weeks that I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually add stuff to my soil,
uh, or to my, to my water, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I use recharge and take out the stash
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and this last man is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My battle, uh, my battle of the breeders,
uh, tent, it was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one gallon pots, uh, and,
um, very, very large harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your initial mix is peat moss wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I'm looking it up right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spagnum peat moss, 65 to 75% of that then
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, it's got some dolomitic lime
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a wedding agent as well as that
pro mix HP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot of people using that with a
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have yet to use that mix, but it's on my
radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe eventually I will try using that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you're using the Gaia green
full full four and two eight four as the
[SPEAKER_01]: initial mending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you go throughout the veg
stage and flower stage, you're doing top
[SPEAKER_01]: dressings of the Gaia green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for additives using stash plan
and recharge, is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What container size are using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in beds or are you in large
containers or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it varies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a couple of different tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have a three by three and in those,
I use five gallon bags or five gallon pots
[SPEAKER_00]: usually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then in my, I like to call it my
micro tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have a two by two by four,
and then I have a one and a half and one
[SPEAKER_00]: by one and a half by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and in those I use one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've kind of been playing with
that man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, with the, with the small grow,
uh, because of, uh, like I, like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to figure out a way to not spend a
whole bunch of money on like a hay Abbey
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that, but still kind of
get, you know, the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I did the, the, the solo cup grow
and, uh, I made a reservoir out of a 16
[SPEAKER_00]: ounce water bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I used a wick, um, like out of a
torch, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: A fiberglass wick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I screwed it into the side of a 16
ounce solo cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I did a whole grill with that,
you know, scragged it out and it turned
[SPEAKER_00]: out great as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was also on my micro tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a solo cup, a one gallon bag
and a five gallon bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically you hear of folks that who are
growing with organic inputs such as
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, they say the bigger,
the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say 10 gallons, 15 gallons,
20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever thought about going up that
high or?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a 10 gallon bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't, I don't grow anything
medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew a, uh, a hibiscus tree out of it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking about planting the bag
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you know, you hear people do that
and, and it's a tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots, you know, get kind of large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking about when it gets,
you know, where I feel like it can sustain
[SPEAKER_00]: itself outside, uh, without having a whole
lot of care, like I give it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think I'm going to plant it,
but yes, it's all the same exact blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of everything that I've just said that I
use for my indoor medical grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my outdoor trees get the same exact
mixture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is how, how easy and,
and how, uh, universal all this stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people think it's hard and it's,
it's really, it's all about perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things overlap from plant to
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are some differences,
but I also grow other plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd grow some leafy greens, peppers,
tomatoes, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some trees that were just
recently planted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Citrus trees, fig pomegranate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm new to all that stuff,
but a lot of the stuff does overlap and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take some things from there and
implement it for medicinal plants or vice
[SPEAKER_01]: versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, it's pretty cool to be able
to branch out and do other plants besides
[SPEAKER_01]: just the medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now for the medicinal plants that you
grow, how big of plants do you typically
[SPEAKER_01]: grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, in the three by three,
uh, you know, that 10 is six foot tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow very large plants in there,
uh, almost as tall as me cause I'm six
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can see over the top of the,
uh, the 10 a little bit, but, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I would say almost, uh, as tall as a
10, about six foot, but I try to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: small because what I've seen is the
smaller the plant is, the more it seems to
[SPEAKER_00]: me, the more dense and heavy it feels out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what I mean is, is like the actual
plant stacks more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's long and lanky, you know,
you've got, if it's a six foot tall plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: three foot of that, is just stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never really understood why you
would grow a plant and put all that work
[SPEAKER_00]: in it and let it grow that much and spend
all this time growing itself legs as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to, you know, dense medical,
uh, uh, material that you're looking for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I found that the smaller plants,
you know, yield more, I feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and I know that's, you know,
it's kind of boat to say, but I really
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's just me, you know,
anecdotally doing it in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm sure in a, you know, a huge,
not homegrown circumstance, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, at home with me,
uh, I found the shorter plants are much
[SPEAKER_00]: denser.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just for instance, this last one,
um, I grew, uh, Atlas seed, Atlas seed
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot of the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was in that, that one harvest over
a hundred grams dried and it was a one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's unheard of and it's,
I couldn't believe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, man, they,
the colas were the size of my forearms,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and a one gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you what size container
for those six foot plants in the three by
[SPEAKER_01]: three, one gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do you veg for before flipping
the flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, five weeks, six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I try to get it past that regressive
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the, I heard somebody
talking about, um, maybe it was Romulan
[SPEAKER_00]: Jake, uh, from Romulan genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about, if you don't wait at
least six weeks, the, the, the hermit
[SPEAKER_00]: rates kind of like try to show them
themselves a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's more of a, uh, I forgot the word
he used.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ever since that, you know, I,
I've started looking at the time because
[SPEAKER_00]: before I was terrible before I started
getting into the community, I just did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't keep track of anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I didn't know what day I planted
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went off the microscope,
uh, on the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know when I flipped it to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that I've started watching,
you know, people that know what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing to do this for a living,
uh, I keep track of things and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, come to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been, I've been flipping,
you know, into flower about a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: about four and a half to week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was having herm issues and I
didn't, I didn't understand why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I stretched it out to the six
weeks and flipped it into flower five,
[SPEAKER_00]: five and a half, six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I have no more of those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what it is and it's not,
it was not with every plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, it kind of made sense
what he was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I put it into perspective,
what I, what I can deal with and what I
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a strange way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never heard that one before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five weeks would be 35 days at the
minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's about what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to do 30 is my goal because I grow
smaller plants as I believe, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I try to do a short veg and flip to
flower fast, but typically I will go 35,
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 days in veg at the minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, upwards of 60, 70 days in
veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm trying to grow a kind of bigger
plant, but yeah, I've never heard that
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as if you flipped a flower to
flower, I assume that you're more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to get a plant that shows intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, it, it, like I said,
I, I compared to my old stuff to what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing since I started keeping track of
everything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does seem to be a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I haven't delved into it enough to
actually like put out a scientific paper
[SPEAKER_00]: on it or anything, but it does seem to me
that there is something correspondence
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's talking about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, um, now I try to go five,
five and a half, six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I flip, uh, but I still keep it
low, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I train, I started training instantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as soon as I, as soon as I can,
uh, I start training, uh, that's because
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, I'm used to growing in such a
small area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like growing up, I had to grow
underneath my stairs and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not very tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to, I had to make do with what I
had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I'll start training early and I
keep things low, um, and it's still small
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you talk about the plants in your three
by three, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many plants are you putting in a three
by three?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and yeah, get into a little bit more
detail of your training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any topping at all or super
cropping or you just sticking with like
[SPEAKER_01]: low stress training?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it was a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, I do a whole lot of low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, but clips, uh, or Amazon's
version of booklets, whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, whatever I got laying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you know, from the start,
uh, I take and bend it straight over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want to say, week two, after it
becomes not a ceiling anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: after it starts actually becoming a
vegetative plant, I start folding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and you know, uh, sometimes I top,
I fold it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I let it grow up, uh, just about a
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it go about a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I need to top it, I'll top it
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but then I start trying to tie it down
to the sides of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after I top it and it starts splitting,
uh, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: After it starts coming up into a fork,
um, I'll take in now, I'll take this with
[SPEAKER_00]: those after about two weeks and tie them
down to the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then those inner inner shoots
start shooting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also do the same thing with
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tie them down to the, to the bag,
uh, and get kind of like an umbrella at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I'll let the plant start
growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then that's when I started
utilizing book clips or, or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: method I use, uh, cause they're not always
book clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, sometimes there are other brands that
I don't remember the names of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I will fold them over with those,
uh, and I'll let those veg out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, about two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right there we're at week five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then sometimes if I feel like I
need to grow, uh, or let it go a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit longer and veg, um, I will,
I will let it do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll flip it into flower the next
week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then start, you know, watching the
real growth happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause the stretch is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about pruning some of the pruning
techniques such as lollipopping,
[SPEAKER_01]: removing the lower third or quarter growth
and also defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any of those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I follow pretty much, um, the,
the, the talk around the town on
[SPEAKER_00]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it week, day 21 of a veg,
uh, week two, week three of flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do foliate a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, man, I know I've been doing
this so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of know what's going to grow and
what's going to actually mature into,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, actual, uh, bud that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so the, like the lower third of the
plant, I just take it all the way off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, because it, I mean, you know,
it really doesn't even grow into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you dry it out, it's like strings.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even really what you want at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would you let your plant,
you know, focus on growing that when you
[SPEAKER_00]: know that it's not going to produce what
you want it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've trimmed that off from the,
from the get go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, during the flowering stage,
that stuff still tries to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I keep it maintained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't want anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want all of my, I want it all to be
focused at the top of my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go back and look at my pictures
on Instagram, you'll see that they all
[SPEAKER_00]: are, they all pretty much look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of my, all my plants do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, short, big fat nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it's kind of like, uh,
emotion that I'm in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's the same thing, you know,
every day I've been doing it so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just, I know what to look
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know when, I know when something's not
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know how to always diagnose
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what all these diseases are,
but I know when something's not right,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to monitor pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's not really an issue
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, uh, since I went to full organics,
um, never, as long as I feed it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and give it water, that's really all I ask
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do similar training and pruning that you
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I took off the lower about a quarter or
lower third, roughly for the lollipopping
[SPEAKER_01]: and then defoliation around the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to avoid doing defoliation of veg as
much as possible, to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some cultivars, some strains that I
grow are just so thick, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tight inner nodes, very leafy,
where I have other things that really are
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of longer inner nodes, less leaf,
don't really need as much pruning done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends on kind of what the
genetics are and how they grow out for
[SPEAKER_01]: what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as day, you had mentioned day
21 of flower to really do that
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically when I'm hitting it with
its final defoliation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, before fulcrum flower,
I'll probably do it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to do it on day seven and day 14 of
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally on day 21, but if I'm
able to push it and not do it until day
[SPEAKER_01]: 21, well, then that's less times I have to
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of similar to you in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like that it's not really a need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the thing about gardening is somebody
does it one way and somebody does it
[SPEAKER_00]: another way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean that both of those ways
are wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about what you feel like you need
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know people that, you know,
they defoliate the whole time they're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go in there every couple of days and
take stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that stressful to the plant,
but these people grow also very nice
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who am I to tell them what they're
doing is wrong?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know what works for me and I know
that it works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it will work for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I'm kind of, you know,
give my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I follow a lot of you,
uh, a lot, man, actually, uh, it's crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm sitting here having this
conversation with you right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there are so many different ways to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say it in so many of my videos and
oftentimes you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not this way is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this way is wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here's one way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it so many different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can still get an end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of shifting backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get back into talking about some
of the additives you use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about using stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first question for you is, do you use
it at the application rate, which is half
[SPEAKER_01]: teaspoon per gallon of water, and do you
use it as a sole drench only or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I kind of watched the video where
you guys tried it as a top dress method
[SPEAKER_00]: and that kind of scared me away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I will say, man, uh, I do it
about, I don't do a half a tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a whole tablespoon, uh, per gallon of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mix up two gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mix two gallons at a time because
like I said, I got small, small,
[SPEAKER_00]: small grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I give the same, uh,
you know, uh, rate rated to, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I give the same amount to my plants
outside as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and stash blend and, um, recharge are
literally the only two amendments that I
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and I still feel that,
you know, it's all organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still staying in the organics only
lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the plus side, I think the reason
why I like the stash blend so much is
[SPEAKER_00]: because man, who doesn't like to smell top
ramen once a week?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now, um, it, the plants love it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really, really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't feel like you can give
them too much because there, there was one
[SPEAKER_00]: time that I accidentally gave a tablespoon
instead of a teaspoon to a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the plants didn't seem to be
harmed by whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that goes back to the plants are
only going to take up what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people that kills them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't understand why we got to do
the more is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: No less is more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of situations when it comes
to, you know, adding anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, your amendments,
you can't overdo it on the God green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can, you can cure your plant or
burn your plants that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't necessarily kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a tough go for a couple of
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, the, the, the stash plant is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did an amazing job creating that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you really did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I like it so much that I,
that I have some and I just give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just give it to folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I didn't try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've actually got a experiment
going around now where I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, just my pro mix, uh, HP, um,
and I got a plan in there and I'm only
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had put no amendments inside the,
the, the soil at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then it's growing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give it a stash blend once a week,
uh, with of course water every couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: days because it needs it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But uh, every few waters I throw stash
blend in there and it seems to be loving
[SPEAKER_00]: life right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I'm, I'm trying to grow a whole
plant without using anything but soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: stash blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody's done that yet,
but it's really an additive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a two one five NPK, but it does have,
uh, some other nutrition in there such as
[SPEAKER_01]: silica, for example, and then beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine that the beneficials of my
chrysal fungi and then the beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria is helping with the breakdown of
amendments for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really glad that you're having good
success with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, uh, for those that didn't catch
that top ramen joke, uh, it's because
[SPEAKER_01]: stash bland, a lot of people say it smells
like beef ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like you guys just took the packets
and put it in these bags because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I, and I grew up, you know,
very poor, so I had a lot of top ramen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the one that can really say,
Hey, this smells like ramen noodles.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a use stash blend and you use
recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is an interesting topic
as well, because there's a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_01]: that think you need to use one or the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many people out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using both stash blend and
recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure, there's some overlapping,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The seaweed overlaps, some of the
beneficials overlap, so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can totally use them at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what are you using for an application
rate for the recharge?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how often?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, uh, actually I didn't,
I wasn't on the recharge game at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, until I saw Rob, y'all had a podcast
with some, I can't remember who it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he was talking about how he uses
recharge and, um, he throws, he said he
[SPEAKER_00]: throws stops throwing stash blend in about
the last two weeks of flour and he starts
[SPEAKER_00]: using recharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I tried that man and it is,
it, it really changed the way things are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is, to me, it seems the same when
you're mixing it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to lie because you know,
it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take it out of the bag, you put it in
water, you mix it up and it turns black.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but the smells are totally different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the recharge smells like just
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course we talked about the
smell of the stash blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then also the, uh, the mounts you
use, the recharge is a much smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: amount, you know, per your application
method versus the stash blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and a little goes a long way with both
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll, I use it only solely drenched
method, uh, because I don't feel confident
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to just throw stuff in the soil and
add water to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't want it to dry anything out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's dry agents in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's a powder, uh, and I feel like it
needs to be mixed properly with water and
[SPEAKER_00]: then added to, to combat those dry agents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know how true that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how I feel personally,
my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the formulation chemist
said is it's generally not recommended to
[SPEAKER_01]: use as just a top dressing or I've done
it, but sprinkling it on top of when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing transplanting, a lot of us
know that mycorrhizal fungi is very
[SPEAKER_01]: beneficial sprinkling directly under the
roots and that's in stash plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tried it and it seemed to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, just by looking at the
plant, it didn't look like there was any
[SPEAKER_01]: stuntage or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been, I'm able to kind of use it,
but yeah, the formulation chemist had
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned that the concern about it
potentially drying out the roots,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, if you were to sprinkle it
directly on the roots, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: killing off the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll, uh, I'll have to try it then
I'll see what I can do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what about recharge?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done any of that with recharge
drive?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that I can remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I usually just do the mix it up on
water and soil drench with the recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So shifting over to watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, what is your water source?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you tap water, reverse osmosis,
some sort of filtered water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you go about waterings?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, tap water, uh, straight from the,
the water spigot outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have, I grow in my garage and I have
a water spigot inside my garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so essentially I just take and run
water from the water hose and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, fill up the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't add anything to the water
at that point, uh, because there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's certain plants that I don't give
any kind of, uh, amendments to,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, as they get with just water,
uh, such as my cactuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take and fill up my bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'll, I got a certain,
certain jugs that I use for my medical
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, when I fill up those,
I'll add, you know, my stash blend if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, or I'll add my, uh, recharge if
I'm going to, but generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to water when the plant tells me it
needs water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do this whole two days or three
days or one day off or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, drive backs are a huge, huge,
huge deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when you're, when you're growing
plants, um, cause drive backs,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gives it that little bit of stress that
it needs to produce more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, and so I, I, I, ideally I try to
like pick up the pot and if I can pick it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and it's pretty light, uh, then I'll,
then I'll give it water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I do the finger method.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll put my finger about halfway into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if I don't feel anything, then I'll
water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then back in the day, when I first started
doing this, man, I thought the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted water all the time and that is not
the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is absolutely not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we've all struggled with
overwatering every now and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, when we started and even to
this day, I, geez, it was just a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: runs ago where I overwatered solo plants
and solo cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the heck is,
you know, it can still be tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get what you mean by that, but I'm a
little bit jittery.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm jealous of you that you're able to use
your tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: My tap water comes out at 485 PPM,
which is very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's, I think it's 80 parts
per million sodium alone, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: good for the plants that we're trying to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, I wish I could use my tap
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to use reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you happen to know what your PPM is out
of the tap?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, but I am actually looking that up
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm kind of curious that you said
that I've never, I just checked the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, um, I just checked the, the EC,
uh, of the water whenever I add the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also checked the pH sometimes pH is
not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what was your EC on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right around 1.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, it's not awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's 900 PPM on a 500 scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about after I add my stuff to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, I'm sorry, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you meant out the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's very, very little.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, 204 PPM is the what's registered
around my area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not, that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear a lot of people having that and
it's less than half of what I'm dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, uh, ironically enough,
the, the, uh, pH straight out of the tap
[SPEAKER_00]: is 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, I can't ask for anything
better really, uh, as far as the pH goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know that if the plants really
do what they, what the organics people say
[SPEAKER_00]: they do, like you don't have to worry
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if the water is just that good when it
comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I mean, that's a very low pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's very, very ideal actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times that's the case where
people say, Oh, I don't worry about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, their initial water source is might
be between 5.5 and 7.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then things just kind of correct
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the plant releases acids, hydroxide
ions that are floating around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things kind of adjust in the medium as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's the reason why a lot of
people say that they don't check pH or
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust pH is because their water source is
fine to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of us have good water sources and
some of us comes from Chernobyl like
[SPEAKER_00]: yours, it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some folks who struggle with like
eight, 8.5 pH out the tap and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I have to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that they have to, because they
come across problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're just trying to water that in at
that high pH, they see physical problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see physical deficiencies and they
get lockout issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they safe side in and knock it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though some of the scientists and
some of these experts are saying you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to pH adjust at all, no matter what
your water source comes out at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just try to play a safe card
on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pH EC as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into environment next.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we didn't really talk about is
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of light do you use and how much
power are you giving your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, as you see by my ghetto,
I'm a huge AC infinity, uh, person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buy everything that I have is AC
infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just because of your guys,
it's because of how they are with the
[SPEAKER_00]: community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I like to show them the support and
the stuff they have is absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenal, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so in my little tents, I have the,
uh, S 22, uh, little onboard S 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's a 115 Watts, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it's putting out about 900,
uh, PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then that's in my small, I have two of
those and I have a, uh, in my three by
[SPEAKER_00]: three, I have an Evo four, uh,
and that, that's the big guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's a 300 watt light,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's putting out about 2000 PPF,
maybe, maybe not 200, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's 3.14 micro moles per Joule
in that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I've never rented full full blast
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I run it at setting like max eight,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it does what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't actually measure the part
self.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know the, the light specifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not really that far in the,
into it at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I probably will get there,
but, uh, not really that far into the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just know that, uh, where I had,
what I had in five, five, six years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: was a blue purple King LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cost me like $400, almost $500 for that
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't pay $20 short today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, it's just, you know, you learn as
you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I just haven't delved into the,
the, uh, science behind the lighting yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I want to, but I've got so much of
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't really have the time to
devote to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of knowledge, a lot of
scientific knowledge behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely a lot to lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a year and a half really diving
deep into lighting and, uh, doing a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of part tests on, uh, 50, 60 different
fixtures alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I've taken a really, really take a
step back from researching about lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: because lighting, we've gotten to a point
where a lot of these fixtures are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: give enough for plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be beyond what you need
for good plant growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you mentioned that you're not even
running the lights at a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people aren't even running their
lights at a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a dim down 80%, 70%,
60% throughout flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: These lights are powerful enough that you
can dim them down considerably and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow the plants very, very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also going to allow your fixture
to have a longer lifespan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running it at a lower,
lower percent is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have AC infinity lightings as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got the T 22s T 24s, Evo threes,
Evo six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about temperature, relative
humidity, CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those are some of the things we
can get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe we'll start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically aim for lights on
and lights off?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots on, um, I'm running about 80,
81.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then lots off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep my, well, I have it out of my
garage and I just installed HVAC into my
[SPEAKER_00]: garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it's about the same, uh,
80, 81 lots on during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at night time is when I cut the
lights off or have the lights go off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's about 70, 70 ish, 72.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so it's about 10 degrees swing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the relative humidity, are you
changing it for the different stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth or how do you go about RH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in Alabama, uh, you know,
our, we're very humid, so I have to keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and, um, I run it depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're in seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the humid, dehumidifier on
it's running about a 75, 80% humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, during the ceiling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and then I cut it on and, and the
whole grow or cut it down to about 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that during flower, you want to go
down a little lower, but I just keep it at
[SPEAKER_00]: 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause to me it's just, it's just easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you supplementing CO2 at all
or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you, uh, I've, I've watched a bunch of
studies and I wanted to, uh, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, when I got to, got, got to looking on
YouTube and how it works and all this and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and watching my like 420 things and,
and Dakota, uh, you know, they're really
[SPEAKER_00]: big into trying out the CO2, but Dakota
made a statement that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your breath is just as equivalent,
you know, uh, as to having CO2 in your
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I hang out in my garage all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always exhaling CO2 and I never,
I never check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even think I'm missing anything by
not using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't feel I am, I don't run
really, really high temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would not be, you know, effective
for, for what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're living in the same space that
you're growing, for example, same home
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're growing in, just what you
exhale can be sufficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a CO2 monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had one for several years and really
kind of looking at it sporadically,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would show always be elevated 600 plus,
you know, 600, 700, 800 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have the AC infinity CO2 monitor and
I'm able to check it from my app as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as it's on the controller as well for the,
the AI plus controller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it's, I read it yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was 875 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not supplementing CO2 anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, as a home grower, small home grow
myself, I have tried the canisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried the CO2 mushroom bags and I
don't, I feel like I don't need to do any
[SPEAKER_01]: of that stuff anymore because my plants
seem to be growing fine and my CO2 PPM
[SPEAKER_01]: levels are elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen, I've seen the videos of the CMB
bags or whatever they are, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the little canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you with those and you said in
the video that you didn't really notice a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I use those, you know, it's not,
you're not a scientist, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you, you, you do it, you, you put
yourself in the situation and you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you experiment and you record it and
you put it on the internet for everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: else to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people like me, we actually watch it
and listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, I've never found,
like, I know that the LED light I was
[SPEAKER_00]: using that was purple was not good,
you know, just by watching the videos as
[SPEAKER_00]: it progressed and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so just by that alone, you know,
I have the, I have enough common sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: know, Hey, you know, he's tried this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a person like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not trying to sell me on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said this doesn't work that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't see a reason for me to try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I really appreciate, you know,
the videos that you do put out and I
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate your book, by the way,
I failed to mention that I've downloaded
[SPEAKER_00]: your book on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad you like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely try to be transparent about
it and I'm not trying to knock CO2 at all
[SPEAKER_01]: or people that you supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are studies out there that
show a 30% increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're having running 1400 PPM
throughout the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you, sir, you can definitely get
more yield if you supplement CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's not for everybody in the sense
where if you're not really looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize your yield, if you're just
growing your own supply, it's super easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow your own and get your harvest
without supplementing CO2, without that
[SPEAKER_01]: additional added expense, whether it be
using the tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the canisters or the mushroom bags,
you're paying money in order to get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're able to not spend that money
and you're able to still get the supply to
[SPEAKER_01]: support yourself, then why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of my approach on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do get the idea behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, I really do, you know,
uh, especially the mushroom bags
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, they, uh, they do excrete a lot of
CO2, but just like you're saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: so do you, when you breathe, um,
that's why the whole mass thing just
[SPEAKER_00]: puzzle me, but you know, you, uh,
you breathe out CO2 and your plants do use
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like people that sing to their plants
are real, real big believers in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that is the music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also the breath that you breathe,
you know, you're breathing out CO2 in your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and breathe that in cause they
breathe underneath the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you're, you're right there at them,
giving them CO2 and I'm sure they take it
[SPEAKER_00]: in, you know, and I'm sure that,
uh, the side, like the scientific study
[SPEAKER_00]: shows, but I just don't have the capacity
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to switch it up and talk about
pests for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, this is something that, uh,
I don't talk about as much in these
[SPEAKER_01]: episodes as, as we should, cause a lot of
people come across pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do in order to prevent pests
from invading your grow space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, believe it or not, man, oils,
uh, peppermint oil, lavender.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I don't, I don't believe in using
like, uh, pesticides even in my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't like that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have kids, I have animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and it is dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why would I want to put something in
there that I have to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll prevent it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and the, the, the, the, the citrus,
the citrus central, uh, central oils and
[SPEAKER_00]: the peppermint and the lavender,
all that really does help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is, uh, I get the,
um, I forgot, I forgot what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: called, but you can get on Amazon and it's
essential oil, like air fresheners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is I put little ones on the
inside of my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you know how your tent has
that, that trail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Liner in the bottom that goes inside of
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, there's a bunch of space in
between the actual tent and that trail
[SPEAKER_00]: liner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stick those, those little things in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, on the plus side,
my room, when I open the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: my tent, when I open up, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so like peppermint and there's never,
I've never had any issues with pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm, I'm not going to wood,
but I really never have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I'm hoping that that's,
that's doing the trick or maybe they just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like the bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't like us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad that that's working out for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you haven't come across any pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's, uh, not a lot of grows can
say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now watch my next couple grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be infested with the jinx yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for this method that you use to grow,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking about the amendments that
you top dress in and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people do this route and try
to keep everything organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, challenges can occur doing it
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say some of the common
challenges are of doing this method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a huge one is for getting to top
dresser plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you, you can literally go like where
it's supposed to be two feedings,
[SPEAKER_00]: not top dresser plants and the downside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always a plus and, uh,
a pro it's sorry, a pro and a con to every
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and growing is no different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the organic side, um, you know,
when you add your amendments, they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: available right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes two weeks for them to start
breaking down for your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: start using them, uh, as opposed to,
you know, synthetic nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it in the plant and the next
day you wake up, the plant looks totally
[SPEAKER_00]: different, uh, because it absorbed the
nutrients already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, organics, man, forgetting to
feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's, that's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I actually don't have to worry
about that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have an alarm set on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that way I know, Hey, today I got to
feed these jokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, because if you don't, so if you,
if you miss a feed and that's four weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, and then you add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you remember four weeks, you know,
after you forgot about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: After your second feed, you're like,
Oh crap, I didn't feel the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then it's going to be another two
weeks before there's any availability of
[SPEAKER_00]: your, uh, your, your nutrients for your
plant to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's six weeks of your plants just
lacking on food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, now they do have their own,
like, um, their own method of saving
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they use what they have, uh,
and they let you know that they need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, if you're doing just
synthetic, I mean, just organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't just fix the problem right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that's where I feel like sin,
sin genetics come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, this is kind of
like a, the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have all of the stuff I need to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't done it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't commit to a feed schedule
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got too much going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So working ahead is so key.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, if you miss a feeding or
even if you're late, like I've had plants
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was just a few days late and then
you start to see the plant yellowing a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, you're like, Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I top dress, it's going to take a
little while for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I miss the breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, and you kind of get
into hot water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where a lot of people get
frustrated is they, uh, they miss a
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding or they're seeing their plants
yellowing and they're like, Oh no,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they top dress and nothing really
happens for at least a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: If not two weeks, those amendments haven't
broken down yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plan just gets worse and worse and
worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's where you can add in either
your synthetic nutrients and go
[SPEAKER_01]: singhannock or let people do teas,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we didn't get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do compost teas at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're just, they're very messy and,
uh, I haven't, I haven't done any,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything, uh, with compost in about two
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I actually do have a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I'm going to try to figure out a
way to incorporate that into, to one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and then, you know, I'll document it
and share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, as far as actually using compost,
no, I have, uh, I have not done too much
[SPEAKER_00]: of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, two years ago, I did a tee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it smelled awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, my wife absolutely hated it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and it was just messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't, I haven't messed with it
since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, compost teas can be beneficial to,
uh, help increase that micro population,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and some of the, um, some of the
nutrients in there are water soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the compost, of course,
but instead of using compost, some people
[SPEAKER_01]: use the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another great way to actually
get those beneficials in there and help
[SPEAKER_01]: break down some of those amendments that
need to be broken down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and that's something I failed to
mention as well, Chris, um, when I was
[SPEAKER_00]: making my soul, uh, for actually a hundred
percent, I left the bag of worm castings
[SPEAKER_00]: in the trunk of my car and I made the
soil, you know, and I put all the,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did all the stuff that I was like,
I was getting ready to grow and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, I planted my plants,
uh, and I went a whole entire run with no
[SPEAKER_00]: worm castings and it was no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was zero issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I was quite surprised by that
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mean, no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's all about, I guess, how you take
care of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the, the, the stash blend
kind of took place of what I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: needed the worm castings for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and also, um, the, the guy green does
a very good job, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at being organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you can't, it, it, it couldn't
hurt me, but I don't think that,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, me not having it in there hurt,
hurt any of my harvest or hurt my run at
[SPEAKER_00]: all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and, you know, since then I have been
added worm castings to my, to my soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I honestly, I don't feel like that I
needed that I need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then, you know, when I make my
next recipe of soil, I might go without
[SPEAKER_00]: adding it and then document it for real
and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you notice a difference,
that'd be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this next question is one that I just
started asking people a couple of episodes
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured it was good to ask because a lot
of viewers want to know, talk to us about
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the top strains that you've grown,
maybe the top three strains that you've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you like about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my battle, the breeders run,
uh, the, which is the last run that I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested, uh, my Atlas seeds to the hut.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was in a very, very, very impressive,
uh, harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, like I said, a one gallon pot,
I had over a hundred grams dry weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so, you know, there was larf,
there was, you know, a whole bunch of trim
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff that came off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, very, very large, dense, dense notes,
very, very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and my other, my second favorite,
I guess, would be my Cali critical mass by
[SPEAKER_00]: Seedman that the flavor, it was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a flavor of smarties in a
smoke, but it, it literally tastes and
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled like smarties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was crazy to me and wasn't a very,
very large order.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You order, uh, but it wasn't very large.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, my third favorite would be,
um, uh, uh, new kids has a strain,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, is called nuke daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a crossback of, I think,
Grenadier perp with one of their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their signature strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and that was a very large order as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so those three, uh, Seedman,
new kids and, uh, Atlas seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you grow the Cali critical mass as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you, how did, how do you feel about
that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Cali critical mass I had, uh,
it was more beefy structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tended to be, to foxtail.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least I had two different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was a three in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was three plants in one container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was, it was overshadowed by the
other two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was only like 10 inches long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other plan I had in its own
container, it was in a 10 gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: container, organic living soil,
real big beefy buds, foxtail like crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like the taste and smell,
I wasn't too crazy about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get the smarties taste that you
had mentioned, uh, any type of candy
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more like a very earthy flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they describe it on their website
as like, uh, a wet forest, a damp floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
Yeah.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like you got something
completely different from what was
[SPEAKER_01]: advertised there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it'd been interesting if you kept
that around and environment comes a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it was just a different
environment compared to what I'm growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in and, uh, you get a different results,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually grown, um, some gorilla
cookies by fast buds and I grew two of
[SPEAKER_00]: them side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the fast flower version and the auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm crazy identical, uh,
as far as the, the structure goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the smell, man, it was one of them
will smell like gym socks and one of them
[SPEAKER_00]: will smell like cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just, it's weird watching that,
uh, be the same one, uh, be the same cult
[SPEAKER_00]: or the same, uh, parents, but are two
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how to explain it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got one of those, the fast flier,
one of the, the auto flower, I guess it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back to how they were crossed when
they were bred.
[SPEAKER_00]: They must've, they might've had a female,
um, of one plant and a male of one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the, for the auto flower,
it could have been the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not, not really sure how I'm going
to, how I was trying to say that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to talk faster than what my
brain lets me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that often too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're coming up towards the end of the
episode here and I want to give you the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to tell the listeners how they
can find you and talk to us about what you
[SPEAKER_01]: have upcoming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, you can find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's two, five, six, four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I have a YouTube, uh, I don't have
very much on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just now started getting into the
editing and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to start putting out
content, um, and over on, uh, Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next community grow along,
I'll be a part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got done with the battle of the
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we're going to let that be,
let that end to see what all that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm sure there's going to be
another community grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I'm actually thinking about
pulling the trigger on buying some,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, uh, child OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give that a go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably going to get some of that out
here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next community grow along, save some space
in your garden for the growers gauntlet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be coming back next
year for 2025 and I'm definitely going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told Luke, I was like, dude,
you would not have won if I was in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke is my dog, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, a great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He, he grows so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mechanimus Luke.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the winner of the 2024 growers
gauntlet and flew him out to LA and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, at a party to celebrate the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next year, 2025, we haven't really
released the details on it yet,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's going to be, uh, going to be a
lot different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say a lot different, but there's
going to be some differences and the
[SPEAKER_01]: celebration is going to take place later
in the year around MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to, uh, kind of have that week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Merged with a growers gauntlet celebration
as well as MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be, uh, should be a larger
gathering than what we had before,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though we had, geez, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: 250 people, I think showed up to the
growers gauntlet celebration in LA back in
[SPEAKER_01]: September.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a pretty big there, but yeah,
we're looking to do it a little bit bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: here in 2025.
