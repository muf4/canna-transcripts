[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, when I first got into Autoflowers,
I was all about HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did try some LEDs back in the day and I
really didn't really like the quality buds
[SPEAKER_00]: that I was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, I've switched completely over
100% to LEDs and I'm probably never
[SPEAKER_00]: looking back to HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a completely different ball game when
you do it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times to finish are definitely not the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start going over 86 or up to 90s,
Autoflowers definitely take a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of a hit and they will not grow as fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Autoflowers are very sensitive to
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get overfed very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, actually depends on the genetics
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is one of the best ways to get like
nice, solid, hard, dense, rock hard buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Groot, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I talk with Dr.
Autoflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is a fellow YouTuber with over 53,000
subscribers and his videos have over 4.3
[SPEAKER_01]: million views combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 13 years and he
grows a variety of plants, tomatoes,
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs, peas, carrots, lettuce,
and medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is most known for growing autoflower
plants, hence his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode, I pick his brain to
find out how he grows autoflowers and also
[SPEAKER_01]: how he maximizes yield when growing
autoflowers.

[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the episode,
I'd like to give a quick shout out to our
[SPEAKER_01]: sponsor, Dutch Pro Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Pro is a plant fertilizer company
that has been around for 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They originated in Amsterdam and their
nutrients are available in several
[SPEAKER_01]: countries across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be using their base nutrients,
which are formulated specifically by water
[SPEAKER_01]: type.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, their two-part soil RO-SO
bottles are specifically designed for when
[SPEAKER_01]: using reverse osmosis or soft water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have base feeds for if you're in
hydro as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll leave a link to their Amazon store

for a discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we are here with Dr. Otto Flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the podcast, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching you guys for a while
and it's good to be on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we first found out about
each other back in like 2015-ish or
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016-ish.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both the channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, this YouTube journey has been
crazy, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to say the least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, turned into an actual full-time
career and it looks like it has for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's crazy how far we came to... I was
going to tell you about like back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: day because you told me like you started
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back of the day in like 2010-2011,
that was back in like poop in the bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: days where people telling each other,
oh yeah, you can poop in a bucket or pee
[SPEAKER_00]: on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there was some crazy information out
there, but yeah, we definitely come a long
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those that don't know who you are,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and kind of how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my channel, actually I had a channel
before and I just deleted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And started a new one that was Dr.
Autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started that back in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some would say I'm one of the originals,
but I think the real original started like
[SPEAKER_00]: as soon as YouTube started back in like
2005-2006.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like I first started pretty much
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My ex-girlfriend, her dad had a really
nice setup and he said, yeah, you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: grow some plants and see how it works for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And gave me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea what those seeds were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually was a type of autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea what I was growing back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just started flowering out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought they were just regular
plants, just doing the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I noticed like, hey, these are
actually forming some decent buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it on 20 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did some research and it turns out
they were autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're actually full
autoflower, but they were autoflower for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what kind of led me on the
journey of autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started doing tons of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, probably the best source of
information was on forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like a complete sponge of
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just super addicted to like just
wanting to learn and research as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was learning from everyone else who's
been growing them for the past back then,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was only like a few years when they
were actually good quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, learned a lot from the forums.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, wouldn't that be a
good idea to kind of give back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: universe or whatever, and just like put
all that information I learned,
[SPEAKER_00]: but online, on YouTube, in an easier form
of information and in a different,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, medium or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I had no idea this could lead to
a career back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's pretty crazy how far we
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's how I kind of got started
with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, I just wanted to learn
more and produce more content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, here we are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, before we started recording,
he had mentioned that he's been gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: for 13 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, you grow a variety of
different plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So tomatoes, herbs, you mentioned peas,
carrots, lettuce on top of the medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of experience across multiple
types of plants, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was telling Mr. Groot here,
the soil I use now, if I, instead of just
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it out after my use indoors,
I'll just move it to my outdoors because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where I use all my regular plastic
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved over to like air pods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And smart pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all my old plastic pots, that's what I
grow my outdoor vegetables and that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of stuff with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it keeps me busy and a little fun
thing to do because I do live in an
[SPEAKER_00]: apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing here is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just go, you know, grow in the
soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have that many options.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that is what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode in particular,
I'd like to talk all about maximizing
[SPEAKER_01]: yield on all the flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you grow huge auto flower
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a track record of growing big
auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen your video, so you've
been doing it for years and years and
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured it'd be a great person to
come on to the podcast today and talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about your style of doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a list of questions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've given those to you ahead of time for
those viewers that don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The guests are given a list of questions
in advance so they can kind of get an idea
[SPEAKER_01]: for what's going to be asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll go through each thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go through nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go through lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go through environment, all these
different factors that impact yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what medium do you usually grow in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in soil, cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing hydro?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've pretty much done everything other
than hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used like kind of, you know,
not the best, just regular bagged soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used soil from our, over at my family
farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like compost pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've pretty much gone and like stayed
with ProMix HP.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most, you know, abundant good
soil I have around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything else is, you know, kind of
mediocre compared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have gone high, or cocoa, and I've used
low quality cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really didn't like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had bad results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really got kind of turned off from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had also awesome results by mixing
two parts ProMix and one part cocoa,
[SPEAKER_00]: like good quality, high quality cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really enjoyed growing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because hydro stores aren't really,
you know, close to me, it's just much
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to stick with ProMix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have awesome results with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why fix what's not broken?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just kind of stay with them and have
awesome results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that ProMix HP, that's the one that
comes with Micorizer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you adding anything else in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you amending, sort of amending
anything else in to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, like, well, when I was doing organic,
I've grown with Guy Green and I forget the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one, but that's the only time I've
ever added stuff into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much now I use all advanced
nutrients for my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really need to have additives,
I find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pretty much keep it like before I
was, I don't know, I'd get really
[SPEAKER_00]: technical with all my growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would add some stuff at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been so long since I don't even
remember what I was adding back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I kind of keep it with a kiss method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple, stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the easier, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it works, don't fix it kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can still maximize yield with
simple techniques, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do try to do more than
they need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, micromanaging in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what drill pot size do you
usually start in and what type of pot do
[SPEAKER_01]: you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastic, fabric, air?
[SPEAKER_00]: For a while there, I was using three
gallon, but I have now switched over to
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the max I like to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gone bigger, like 10 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just seems like you're doing too
much work for not that much big of a
[SPEAKER_00]: difference with all the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I always recommend five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three gallons good too, if you don't have
all that room or you don't want to use so
[SPEAKER_00]: much soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, I like to stick with five
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are those the air pots or the plastic
pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are, I kind of do a mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do air pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I do smart pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air pots are a little annoying to work
with because water can just like run out
[SPEAKER_00]: the side super easy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you got to suck up all the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That runs off into your catcher.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say, yeah, I really enjoy
going with smart pots now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just seems like you get better growth
all around, especially compared to like my
[SPEAKER_00]: old plastic pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely recommend those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you do need oxygen down in that
root zone and that does help with growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's one of the reasons why a
lot of people go with cocoa is because it
[SPEAKER_01]: adds that air into the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ProMix is a lighter medium when you
compare to soil too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get that air in there and
that along with the either air pots or the
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help with aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to help with with overall
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if I did have access to some good
high quality cocoa, if I didn't have to
[SPEAKER_00]: order online, pay for shipping,
all that, I definitely would use it
[SPEAKER_00]: because you do get more air.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to water a little bit sooner,
but you get a bit better results than just
[SPEAKER_00]: using ProMix HP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I would definitely recommend a
mix if someone else was interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into like my kind of style medium
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a mix is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one of the most debated pieces of
this is starting in the final container.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people out there who argue that
you need to, you should start in the final
[SPEAKER_01]: container, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had mentioned three gallon grill
pots, five gallon grill pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people say plant that seed
directly into that medium, avoid the
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting process is what they're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're starting in this small
solo cup, for example, and transplanting
[SPEAKER_01]: up, there is that risk of transplant shock
happening, slowed growth happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers, they're on a limited life,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any stunning growth the
first 30 days or so, or any point of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow actually, it could negatively impact
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most likely it's going to negatively
impact yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you start in the final container
or you transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like you said, nothing's like
written in stone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have seen some decent grows,
very good grows that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like you said, like there is
that chance and the chance is pretty high
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're going to stunt the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally started directly in the
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start in five gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to do three gallons,
start in three gallon, but just keep it as
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you're way less likely to get
risk of shock or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one caveat is I've seen that growing
outdoors, I think it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually can have better results I
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've tried both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried planting directly in the ground
and just Dixie cups one week old and then
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely noticed that the ones
planted directly outside didn't fare as
[SPEAKER_00]: well for like up here in Canada,
I get some cold nights, so it kind of hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: them, I would suspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they had some, you know,
they were taken off a bit, they could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually handle it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually had pretty decent results
when transplanting outside, because it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like it's a completely different
ball game when you do it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Times to finish are definitely not the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 60 day strain will not, especially where
I am, it will not finish in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they can get way bigger than normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a huge root mass area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just plant them directly in the
ground, some good soil, their roots get
[SPEAKER_00]: gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've grown like probably the biggest
auto flowers I've ever grown and I
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant them, but they didn't finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't really, you know, get the,
you know, cream of the crop or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: a good harvest, but definitely grew some
massive, massive plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So did it stunt it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was more environmental issues
that I had to deal with, but it just seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like outdoor they can handle transplant
more because planted directly,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have the best start,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be people that
comment on this video and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, I transplant autos every time and I
don't have any stunt and growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a myth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole transplanting slows down growth
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either way, if you're new to auto
flowers, maybe try both and see which one
[SPEAKER_01]: you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like everything you should see as an
experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want, try one plant directly,
the other one transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the same genetics, if you get
awesome results still, then do what's easy
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are going to go the transplant
route, maybe, you know, when you do that
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant, a common technique is a
sprinkle mycorrhizal fungi on the roots as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing the transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, it's basically like an
extension of the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fungi extends the roots,
helps with nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people swear by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people like, oh, I start in the
small cup so I can do that sprinkler of
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycorrhizal and then they go into
their final pot and then it just blows up
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many different ways to
kind of go about that for sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find what works best for you and stick
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now how about water?
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of water are you typically using
when you grow auto flowers, tap,
[SPEAKER_01]: rain, distilled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, like I have used, uh,
when doing it outdoors, I have used rain
[SPEAKER_00]: and seemed to work really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but here in my apartment building,
I do just, just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, uh, I don't purify it or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have the setup for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, I would love to, if I had my own
house, get something set up like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, just straight tap water,
let it sit out for a day, decolonize and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't really pH it or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, actually I do page it just a
little bit, just so it gets close to like
[SPEAKER_00]: the 7.0 pH mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I use page perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really worry about pH,
but yeah, just straight old tap water
[SPEAKER_00]: settle for a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then kind of getting you to the
nutrition side of things you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for nutrients using advanced
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that typically what you use when you're
trying to maximize yield with auto flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: is the advanced nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, like I've used a lot of
nutrients before I've had also awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: results with Remos nutrients, uh,
shout out to Remo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I've kind of just switched
to, cause I noticed before a lot of my
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, if I did have issues was normally
from pH issues, just imbalances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just got annoying chasing the pH
cause my pH here can get pretty high and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just annoying to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once switching to pH perfect,
I kind of stopped having pH problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, getting awesome results still and
good quality bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy with it and, uh, keeping it
simple and yeah, still getting awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty, pretty, pretty happy with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned you're just using the
base nutrients for advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have a couple of different
bases, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like a grow and, uh,
which ones are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually don't use the base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a pretty decent, uh, kind of what
you would call it a grow schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding schedule or whatever online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it uses the, uh, what's it,
the Sensibloom because the Sensibloom is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, it's got like enough, uh,
nitrogen that it can last the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people have shown like,
you can just get awesome results just
[SPEAKER_00]: using that the whole way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and yeah, plants seem to love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't get super, they don't like run
out of nitrogen halfway through the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely a good all around
nutrient to use, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's Sensibro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like there's two bottles for
Sensibro and then there's Sensibloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sensibloom is the only one I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you following a feeding chart off
of their website?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the one I follow, I forget what it's
called.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but if you search Sensibloom,
uh, schedule, auto flower, it should pop
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on a forum there, but it's pretty
much, um, it's, I think it's more,
[SPEAKER_00]: less than half of what they recommend or
maybe even one third of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's definitely much less than
they recommend for their regular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to do, you know, it's,
it's on the level of like almost being too
[SPEAKER_00]: much sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I even go like a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, let's say the beginning,
uh, feeding during veg, my very first
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding, I'd probably give, um,
like 1.5 milliliters of each A and B or
[SPEAKER_00]: two milliliters, depending on how the
plants are looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's pretty small because they,
I think they recommend five milliliters
[SPEAKER_00]: when you first start something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it is a bit, a bit less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're not using any additives on
top of that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any, are using any sugars like,
um, or any microbial inoculants or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm using Fudu juice, B-52,
uh, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rhino skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that kind of helps with the
strengthening of the stalks and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go intermittently with the cow mag,
big buds and the, the sugar stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what it's called, but it,
it, it has the sugars, bud candy or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's pretty much what I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during flower, I switch over to
the, uh, their flowering additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of take out the,
the veg additives and switch it up a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think I might have to do a,
a video on that on my channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of explain exactly what I use for the
entire growth for autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I might have to come up with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you use some additives, there's
definitely some sugar in there and like
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes in there, beneficial bacteria and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those bottles that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting the full nutrition there
from advanced nutrients for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you said you don't with a pH,
advanced nutrients has pH perfect there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's patented technology or
something that really, when you make,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked them how, because my, my water can
get up to like 9.1 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's kind of annoying to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I asked them like, Hey, my pH is really
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this work for mine?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, uh, the best thing I could
do is get it down to 7.0 around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just, you know, just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular, uh, nutrients and,
uh, pretty much the way it goes is you add
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the main, like if you're using
sensitive bloom, you'd use, use,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, put sensitive bloom in first and then
all the additives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but what I do now is I found out,
uh, I, I use the T and B up and down the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I just found out how much I need
for 7.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can pretty much eyeball it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just take a little scoop, put it in there,
boom, boom, done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even use a pH pen anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, just do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix up the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never had a problem yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are monitoring the pH going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, some people what they'll do is they'll
monitor the pH of the medium as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether that be a runoff test or a slurry
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do anything like that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to, but now I keep things so simple
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't see any pH issues pretty much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of pretty much just.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it takes more time up and I'd
rather keep it as simple as possible in
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden.
Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about some people more monitor
the PPM or the EC of it to know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get an idea of how much nutrients are
going into their medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, do you monitor the EC or PPM kind of
going in after you create that mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out at all or no, I used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, keeping kiss method,
super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I just don't anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feed the whole way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that's why I keep it a little bit less
than what they recommend on the advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, like calculator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put in how much water you're using
and like what a growth cycle you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell you how much to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use like two thirds of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use it throughout the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I get to about week six or seven,
start with the flush, flush everything
[SPEAKER_00]: out, make sure it's all nice and clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have any black ash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nutrition kind of just went
over what you do for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up and talk about
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, arguably one of the most,
if not the most important thing when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about yield is,
is lighting and getting that energy down
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The optimal amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it could, the yield could definitely
be sacrificed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not giving enough par,
um, enough of that radiation, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: down onto the plant or too much could harm
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you get light burn and slow down
growth as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you typically using?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for lighting in order
to maximize yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point on, uh, talking about the,
like burning, like too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just think, oh, more light,
more lights in there, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's why I always recommend people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get a par meter or a lux meter and learn
how to convert it from lux to par.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it is definitely needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, before, when I first got into auto
flowers, I was all about HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I did try some LEDs back in the day
and I really didn't really like the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of buds that I was getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, nowadays I've switched completely over
100% to LEDs and I probably never looking
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I use optic LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the bar lighting, bar lighting seems
to become super popular lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last two years or so, um, many
companies are switched over that and the
[SPEAKER_00]: results I'm getting are better than what I
was getting on HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say buds are super dense and
thick, uh, not getting any weird
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching and stuff back like you'd get
back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the terpenes are even better than HPS,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, I'm super happy since
switching all the way over tail LEDs and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, yeah, pretty happy with the results I
get all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs have come so far over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if we had this conversation back
in 2014, 2015 ish, uh, there would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: debateable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you'd have led grill lights coming out
that are less efficient than HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you have these, these people
advertising their lights saying that it's
[SPEAKER_01]: more energy efficient when it's actually
less efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really bad back in the day when,
when LEDs first kind of came on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the blurple days of the
targeted light spectrum with the blues and
[SPEAKER_01]: the reds only and eliminating those greens
and you just see purple and, oh man,
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't I strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, I remember back in the day when
HPS was the main thing, there were people,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would come on and they would want to
like, uh, do like grow battles and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and hey, let's do a competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I think I can beat you with LEDs and
you use HPS and there was no competition
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it was, it was not a competition back
in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, 10 years later, nine years later,
it's, there's no competition comparing HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like the energy you save the heat,
you like, uh, you don't have to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: all the heat and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the light spread is just has gotten so
damn good that it just doesn't make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: to go with HPS anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still get good results off of it,
but, um, definitely more efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: better light spread with the LEDs and so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is there a specific amount of PAR
that you aim for during this different
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of growth when you're looking to
maximize the yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I know you said you have a PAR
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some general ranges out there,
which I've mentioned on my channel many,
[SPEAKER_01]: many times of general ranges that people
can aim for during the different stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you look at that and aim for a certain
amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, if anyone asks, I always recommend
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said before, if you don't have a
PAR meter, they're expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like 500, $800, I think here in
Canada, I think 500 or 600 in America or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but a lot of them, a box meter you can
get for like $40 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a simple conversion you can do
to get PAR pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, I recommend, um,
for auto flowers, it's pretty similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: for veg plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would see the first, uh, first three
weeks would be what you would give for
[SPEAKER_00]: veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would start at 200 PAR and slowly
ramp up to about, uh, 550, 600 PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of, uh, veg there, once it
starts flowering and during the first week
[SPEAKER_00]: of flower, I'll probably slowly go from,
uh, 550, 600, slowly go up until about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say week 5.5 or six, like slowly
ramp up to about 900, 850, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's where I usually see the best
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, it is a slow ramp up and,
uh, that, that is the nice thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: having a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually check every day and say,
okay, it's cause your plants are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't always have to just lower the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as they're, you're keeping your
PAR and it's slowly going up, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: you're doing awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that is one of the best ways to
get like nice, solid, hard, dense,
[SPEAKER_00]: rock hard buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing your PAR is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, uh, it's super important,
especially if you're giving you,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people don't realize that they're
given the light or their plants too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that issue before when I wasn't
using my PAR meter, I was just cranking up
[SPEAKER_00]: the light and then, oh, I go check and my
PAR is at like 600, 700 during veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, oh yeah, I'm frying my
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely something I recommend
people look into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the higher light levels is pretty
much the same in line to what I aim for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going, you know, 900 max really.
[SPEAKER_01]: For flowering is typically what I go for
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're supplementing CO2, you can go
higher than that in most cases.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you supplementing CO2 at all right now
or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was using, uh, the kind of like the
mushroom bags, CO2 bags or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I was cranking up the LEDs a little
bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going up to like 950, 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't notice light burn really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they were, I think if someone asked me
like, how much does it actually help?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say maybe 5% better growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't see it as like a huge
amount, but if I actually had a real CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, yeah, I would definitely be going
higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've heard of people going up to like,
uh, 1200, uh, PAR or sometimes even higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't have a, uh, CO2 setup like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I haven't really got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do grow pretty much right next to
our bedroom pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't really want CO2 all throughout
the house and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, maybe one day when we have
something separate, um, I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into CO2 a bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you still using mushroom bags or
not anymore?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, no, I kind of stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, made me think like, is, is this
releasing spores throughout the house or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really see a huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge, huge difference to make me want to
go spend, you know, I think they're around
[SPEAKER_00]: like 60, $70 bag or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little pricey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just thought might as well just
not do it this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you're not supplemented,
since you're not supplementing CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: air exchange is going to be super
important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're not exchanging the air,
the plants are just eating up that CO2 and
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow tent or grow room, whatever
you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically do?
[SPEAKER_01]: For air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I got the window just wide open
fans blowing all in the outdoor air.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this year I'm a little worried about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I did end up with mites last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was super angry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but this year I think I might have to
set up a portable AC unit just so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sucking in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the window wide open for bugs
to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's probably my best bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also grow with my, my tent doors just wide
open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't really tend to close them all
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I just feel like the air
movement is just much better when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: it wide open like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fans blowing everything around got the,
uh, in intake fans, uh, sucking it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't take my intake fans and put it
out the door because I'm an apartment
[SPEAKER_00]: building building.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want people seeing a bunch of
tubes going to the window and stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: them wondering what that's all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I keep it pretty low key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would like to have a more proper
setup for moving air out, but is what it
[SPEAKER_00]: is for right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you running into any temperature
issues the way you're doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what's the temperature you usually aim
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well going with LEDs, I normally would
want it around like 80, 80 Fahrenheit to
[SPEAKER_00]: about 85.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to have it at, uh,
and that's the canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, try to keep it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it does get a little hard to do
sometimes in the, you know, dead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: dead of summer or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's, it's a little intense,
uh, cause I am an apartment building.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it does get a little hot in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes me think I should probably
get a AC unit just for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't affect the crop or anything,
but, uh, normally during winter time,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have any issues with
keeping the temperatures down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, during the winter, it kind of helps
keep my place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's the nice thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, try to keep in those
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you start going over 86 or up to
nineties, the auto flowers definitely take
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of a hit and, uh,
they will not grow as fast, I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to go up to 85, 87 actually is kind
of what I maxed out at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some cultivars were able to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other cultivars, you'd see that stress
come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I brought it down a notch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually now I'm actually aiming for,
um, typically leaf surface temperature to
[SPEAKER_01]: be like 80 to 82 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the cultivar,
um, most of them will be able to take
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and that means that the canopy
temperature usually is a little bit higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than the leaf surface temperature,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually, you know, two, three,
four degrees potentially, depending on,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, the light you're using and how much
it's radiating down on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the amount of IR comes into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about, we get into a whole discussion
about HPS versus LED, just as the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of heat that comes down, but we won't get
into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense for, for temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what about humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, what do you typically aim for,
for humidity through the different stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, really I just try to keep it as low as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't mess with the,
I know it's better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, uh, what is it called?
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the chart that Matt VPD like I have
tried to go buy that, but I really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want high humidity at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like none lower the humidity for me is the
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have had issues with mold in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this is during winter time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Winter time is super important for me to
like, have as little as humidity as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have dehumidifiers trying to keep it as
low as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause when you're running four tents,
it can get kind of high in one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, I've had issues with mold in
the past where here in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets so cold that the humidity will
start, uh, creating ice on the windows and
[SPEAKER_00]: then start dripping down and stuff and
dripping down your window.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get too much of that stuff,
it can be really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruin all the wooden stuff under the
windows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really don't like humidity at all
anymore and, uh, try to stay away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, do I see much of a difference with
growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, compared to when I've had it,
I like really perfect humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't noticed that much of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just try to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's low humidity and it's doing good,
why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that and not have to worry about
molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say low humidity, what percentage
around is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, here it's normally around 40,
45, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not critical.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some places where it's like 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really don't want it to go up to
like 50, 55, 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I started getting worried and
I can start seeing condensation on the
[SPEAKER_00]: windows summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to worry about that,
but I'd rather just have a setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to like mess with every
winter and summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And VPD, you know, as it, it is optimal,
as we all know, you know, science has
[SPEAKER_01]: proven that that VPD is somebody who
doesn't know about VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can search that and find out a lot
more details on that as a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, article from pulse pulse monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a good article about VPD,
what it actually is, what the different
[SPEAKER_01]: ranges you should aim for during the
different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's charts that you can go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going after V I've been chasing
after VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the past several grows and,
um, you know, there, there definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be a little bit different in
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say from my experience as far as
mostly about like quality bud structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like as I'm running low humidity,
like I struggle here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very dry here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking at 20% natural humidity,
20, 30% natural humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I don't have humidifiers pumping
things up there, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pumping that humidity up and getting high,
I do see impact with growth, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just kind of my experience,
but 40 isn't, isn't critically low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it shouldn't, my experience isn't a
big difference between, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 30, I'm sorry, there is not a big
difference between 40 and like 50%,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you talk about optimal VPD,
specifically in the flowering stage,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you're running the,
what 78 to 82 degree range.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the high fifties, I think I
believe is the green range for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just on the cusp, I think, but it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me by, um, yeah, like it's,
it does get really, uh, like, like dry
[SPEAKER_00]: like that here too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes outdoor humidity is
probably like the same as yours,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially during winter time,
but indoors when I got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 16 pots, five gallon pots full of water
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can make the humidity in there and,
uh, keeps it pretty stable, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about plant training
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, arguably one of those things that
are going to impact yield a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's some websites out there
that say low stress training alone is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to increase yield by 40%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say particularly with auto
flowers, you know, a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_01]: plant training techniques because they
want to maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so what plant train techniques do you
typically do?
[SPEAKER_01]: For auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, right off the bat, I start doing leaf
tucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just tucking the leaves in any of the
big fan leaves that you can see that kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of can tuck in between the lower branches
coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can give those lower branches a
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I would say the more low stress
training, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, some people get really into it,
really just tie them down every place they
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you can do it, the better
your results are going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more light that can penetrate through
to the lower branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's, it's, it's definitely going
to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've done it where I just don't do any
training at all compared to when I do lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of training, lots of training always
produces better results.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've grown, um, now I know when you're
growing from seed, there's different
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos, different growth, blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, growing the same
cultivar, I had 10 different plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually say 10 different phenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same strain or cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, some I did low stress training on
some I just grew naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones that grew naturally,
I believe it was, uh, let's see a yield
[SPEAKER_01]: range from like three and a half ounces up
to I think five ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the low stress training ones
always produce more than that up to eight
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces from low stress training off,
off of an auto.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that was, I think the highest deal
that ever got off of an auto was eight
[SPEAKER_01]: ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was with low stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now what about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping that's one of the debatable topics
on this is people say no high stress
[SPEAKER_01]: training techniques at all should be done
for autos or else you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively impact yield topping,
you know, is one of those things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: high stress training techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you top auto power plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you avoid that or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, normally I just avoid that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not big into topping at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, even for photo periods, I more prefer
super cropping, but for auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have been thinking about just
trying just for a little experiment,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a video, put it on my channel and
just show people what's the difference,
[SPEAKER_00]: use the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but normally it would take what five,
six, maybe seven days to recover from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which your art of flower could be
using to produce, get like more branches
[SPEAKER_00]: getting bigger instead of just trying to
heal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally I would tell a beginner or
someone just get into our flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't top, just stick with low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, but if you're getting more
advanced and you want to just try it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, like we were talking about before,
different genetics can handle it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like, um, I've seen some amazing
grows, people topped it and had awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I've also seen people top and get bad
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of really depends, depends on
how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing them to depends how big these
plants are getting, like, are you growing
[SPEAKER_00]: a small little plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to get more bigger than a
foot and a half, or are you growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that's normally can get up to four
feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's the super autos that get
really big and then smaller autos that say
[SPEAKER_00]: really small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it kind of depends, but me
personally, I just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I low stress train enough that it creates
a, like a decent bush and a nice canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, like when you grow,
just let it do its thing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will normally grow up like a
Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get some really nice buds on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first, you know, one third of it and
the rest, they're kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not that great as some quality of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a nice canopy and you've
got way more top buds all getting the good
[SPEAKER_00]: light, uh, it comes out better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, yeah, I've topped autos handful
of autos in the past and obviously I've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown plants where I haven't topped them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just every time it's been more yield
off of the non-topped plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just my experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be people in the
comments again, that say they top autos
[SPEAKER_01]: every time and it doesn't impact growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe I just need to experiment
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure I've like accidentally
topped some too.
[SPEAKER_00]: The results came out good, but that the
question is, would have, would have it
[SPEAKER_00]: been better if you just not topped it at
all and just low stress chained until you
[SPEAKER_00]: got a nice big canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, uh, you know, all nice and even,
I would say a better big canopies can give
[SPEAKER_00]: you better results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Highly debatable product on topping auto
flowers versus non-topping auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know in the comments below for
those that are growing autos, do you top
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know your experience doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked a little bit about pulling
the branches out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do anything for like plant support?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, scrub technique, anything like
that in order when you're growing your
[SPEAKER_01]: autos or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my autos compared to my photo
periods, because I grow my photo periods
[SPEAKER_00]: bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, my auto flowers seem to be very
sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never really need to like tie them up or
anything or have a stakes, tie them to
[SPEAKER_00]: stakes or whatever, or do the,
uh, Scrog nets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers, the ones I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, seem to do really good with without.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, we kind of went over a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went over nutrition, went over
lighting, went over environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: all for autos and kind of talk about
things that, that you do in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything being said and every,
all your experience growing auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: what advice do you have for people who are
new to growing auto flowers and what
[SPEAKER_01]: advice do you have for people who are
trying to maximize yield with auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most important things to start
with good genetics, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, stick with some reputable brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the thing with auto flowers is you can
get some not so reputable, reputable
[SPEAKER_00]: brands, and they may not actually be full
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had that lots in the past where
you're growing it and it's not actually
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to switch it to 12 and
12 light just to get the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of know that those genetics
aren't really stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so I always recommend Mifit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, always had great results with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, like we were talking about in the
path or in the start there, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: start, I recommend people start in the
post that they're going to finish in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three gallons or five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I recommend that they use a good
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, a lot of people just use, I don't
know, some, some people just go the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardware store and get some just
random dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend getting something good
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least some pro mix, some good quality
cocoa, or, you know, there's some other
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but definitely stick with some quality
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and when you're feeding nutrients,
it's don't go by what they're actually
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you to go on the bottom of the
bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, the instructions it's normally at
least half or even one third of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're telling you to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause auto flowers are very sensitive
to nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get overfed very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like, or actually depends on the
genetics too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that, uh, keep your par
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure you're not giving them too much
par or too little par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, yeah, just try to not stress them
as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not stressed, they can just
take off and do the thing and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you'll get some awesome results.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you stress them too much, you mess with
them too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of kind of stunt the,
stunt your results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good advice there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched on a lot of pieces that are
really important when it comes to autos
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can the listeners find you and what
do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can find me over at the Dr. Auto
Flower channel there on YouTube or Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto Flower on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the best places to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, things we got coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a new season started right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are, I'm just starting some new
auto flowers right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting them planted here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and yeah, I got some photo periods
going too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do grow a lot of photo periods and mix
it up with the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I like to do pheno hunts, so can't
really do that with auto flowers as,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I kind of stick with,
uh, photo periods if I'm doing pheno
[SPEAKER_00]: hunts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but yeah, you can find me over there
and got a new season, new content coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will link Dr. Auto Flowers channel down
in the description section below for those
[SPEAKER_01]: of you watching on YouTube or I mean,
if you're tuning in on one of the podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: platforms, just search on YouTube,
