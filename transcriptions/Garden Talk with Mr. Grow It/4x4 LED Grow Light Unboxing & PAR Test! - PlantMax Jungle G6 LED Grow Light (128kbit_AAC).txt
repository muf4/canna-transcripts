[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the PlantMax Jungle G6 LED
Grillite.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED Grillite was sent to me in order
to do this unboxing and part test video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video I'll do just that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll unbox the unit, I'll show you what
comes inside the box and then I use my
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee MQ500 PAR meter in order to do the
PAR test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any light being emitted
outside of that range, it will not show on
[SPEAKER_00]: this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first thing out the box is the
Grillite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is folded in half and nicely packaged
to prevent damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there are two boxes inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is labeled accessories and the second
one is labeled LED driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the box that's labeled LED driver
is, surprise surprise, a driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the box that's labeled accessories
is a user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: A controller, connector cable,
an AC power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this bag there are two sling
hangers, a 120 volt 240 volt power adapter
[SPEAKER_00]: and some screws to mount the driver to the
back of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time tuning into my
PAR test videos, I do these just to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a general idea of what the power
output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test isn't going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking measurements in a grow tent and
the reflective walls in the grow tent
[SPEAKER_00]: could increase the PAR numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coverage area for this LED grow light
is 4 feet by 4 feet and I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in a 4 foot by 4 foot grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the grow
lights features, but I will provide a link
[SPEAKER_00]: in the description section below so you
can click to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light does have a dimmer on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'll have the grow light
on 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the grow light is on and turned up to
100%, it pulls 659 watts from the wall
[SPEAKER_00]: with 5.46 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get started.
Let's
get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about this LED grow
light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that this grow light is
linked in the description section below so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can click on that link if you want to
learn more about this light and I'll leave
[SPEAKER_00]: it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
