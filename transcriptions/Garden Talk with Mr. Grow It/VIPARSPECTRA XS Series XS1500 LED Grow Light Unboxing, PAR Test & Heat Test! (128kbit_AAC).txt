[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the Viper Spectra XS1500 LED
grow light and in this video I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: unbox the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to test the PAR output and I'm
going to do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the
features that this grow light has but I
[SPEAKER_00]: will leave a link down in the description
section below so you can click on that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to learn more about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay first thing out the box is the
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is a wire hanging kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: A set of rope ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A card here which shows you what to do if
you're happy or if you're not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly is an instruction manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extending Range PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these PAR tests just to give you a
general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering coverage area is 2 feet by 2
feet and I'm taking measurements in a 2
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by 4 foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to keep my PAR meter in a
2 foot by 2 foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be taking measurements at three
different distances 12 inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches, and 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 1.23 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 147 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below so you can click on that link if you
want to learn more about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
