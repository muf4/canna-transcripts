[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_03]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 126.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this episode, I interview Patrick and
Mrs. Grow Daddy from Grow Daddy TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been gardening for four years
and grow a variety of plants, such as
[SPEAKER_03]: tomato, basil, cilantro, parsley,
medicinal plants, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of their main goals when gardening is
to achieve a top quality product and get a
[SPEAKER_03]: high yield, which I thought would be an
excellent topic for today's episode.
[SPEAKER_03]: How to get both quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips

[SPEAKER_03]: Today, I am joined with Patrick and Mrs.
Grow Daddy from Grow Daddy TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: How y'all doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, thanks for having us, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're awesome, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy to have you both on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've re-showed to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeez, it seems like a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking to come on, and I apologize for
not having you on earlier than this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the amount of requests I get
from people looking to come on,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we've got guests that are looking
to come back on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to balance everything,
and finally was able to get you on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate your flexibility and your
patience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you kidding, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a year, five months,
four days, and three hours ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited for today's conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we get into things,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_03]: yourselves, maybe how you got into
gardening as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've always kind of had a little
bit of a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would kind of plant some flowers around
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from Northern California,
now living in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I moved up here about six years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I liked flowers and stuff in the yard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I moved up here, I didn't do a
lot before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I moved up here,
just after I think I moved up here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the law got passed that we could
legalize medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, I think the next year I was
here, the next summer that was coming up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a hold of a couple small plants and
threw them on the deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really didn't really, I figured I'd
just kind of grow them out like tomato
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, more or less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really know a lot about growing,
you know, because I was a truck driver my
[SPEAKER_00]: whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I couldn't, you know, I couldn't
consume anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he got tests, you know, regular
random tests or whatever as a truck
[SPEAKER_01]: driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, this was really exciting for
me to move up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California would have been the
perfect place to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, but nevertheless,
nevertheless, moved up here and grew my
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple on the deck and found out
very quickly, this is not a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: place to grow this type of plant because
we had a real crappy summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I think it rained every day
except for I had a buddy come up and visit
[SPEAKER_00]: me that year and he visited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember he was up here in August.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was up here for an actual summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I grew some really big plants,
just adding water to some decent soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: some fertilizer, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not knowing what the hell I was doing with
some pretty decent plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of course, I didn't know how to dry
and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hadn't gotten on the YouTube
channels yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to remember, I'm old, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing all this young guy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started on roll it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to a couple of forums and got a
little bit of information, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even think I got it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was still working on my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I dried it just doing what seemed to be
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I dried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just just the most horrible stuff in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you what, it was pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are in Canada in like, you know,
the west coast of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is it's just dark and wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may remember your first gross,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you thought you were growing some
great stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'll tell you what, my first I
thought I was going to just anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was the best stuff on earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the greatest things is
when you're growing your own stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's bad, it probably tastes
really good because you're growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and then the next year I said,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do this outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me try this indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I think when I started getting
into watching YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even then I didn't look because my
first one was kind of in the dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a four by four and some lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was four years ago when I started
growing indoors with basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided I was going to grow indoors
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I go to the dispensary,
that's the most expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I want to grow the cheaper stuff
when I have total control of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know why I was growing
organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born organically because it was so
expensive to buy organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was my basic, you know,
start in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I started, I think,
in a four by four with a with a TS two
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand two with a TS three thousand Mars
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't start that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to let you know, I was growing and
then I got on a forum and I'm showing some
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures as I'm starting to go into
transition and I'm showing the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody goes somebody goes like this in
one of the forms goes is that's a blurple.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of power, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they asked me a few questions and I
go, it's a you know, it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blurple, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's it's it's giving me like a
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's giving me like 200 watts for the four
by four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, on flower, but I'm only using
100 watts to veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honest to God, this thing vegged
everything out really nice, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: low.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was really nice and filled up
the whole tent, kind of veg it out before
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I got this thing in the in the in the
forum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's telling me I'm not going to be
able to grow good flowers with the light
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have this blurple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I got to start doing research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge emergency, like a research
emergency a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think this is what really powered me
into the YouTube and started looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: other growers and beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get a lot of bad advice at
this point, you know, or you're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're saying put 2000 watts,
you know, they're just so you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the excess that you get
from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants on the Internet seem to
want me to put too much fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_00]: too much water, too much everything in a
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he was getting some pretty bad
advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, needless to say, I put that
light in in the grow and it just did a
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful job on the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I say for the first grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got that light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ordered the light just at transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had about two or three weeks to get
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just putting that light in just
at about the second or third week of
[SPEAKER_00]: flower would just when it needed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turned out my first grow was just
amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hooked ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely hooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 watts in a four by four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking I'm thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh, jeez, I don't think that is
a 200 watt blurple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good that you were able to kind of
upgrade and get through flower and have a
[SPEAKER_03]: successful grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable 10 unbelievable 10 full of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still look back at it and go,
man, that was just a gorgeous,
[SPEAKER_00]: gorgeous growth to look on the Internet or
to look in pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just one of those beautiful,
beautiful canopies and even the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, by the way, I saw your Kyle Cushman
video the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the first guy I listened to
about when I went when I got to transition
[SPEAKER_00]: on that grow and or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I got to transition and about default
because I didn't do any lollipopping or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I got to transition, I listened
to I found a video of Kyle Cushman and he
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking about the about the super
cropping and about the Kyle Cushman
[SPEAKER_00]: chiropractic chiropractic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then hearing that on your show the
other day, him talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea this was learned a couple
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had no idea this was him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was just kind of jokingly
saying this is Cushman chiropractic,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what I've always kind of called
it, thinking that somebody else invented
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know if it was his invention,
but he kind of he kind of he kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coined it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He kind of said this was his.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I respect Kyle respect, buddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that was a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really thrilled that I got him on there
because he has just done so much over the
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thirty plus years doing not only growing,
but advocate as well in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think he pointed me in the right
direction, you know, for the first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just gotten lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some pieces and I talk about a
lot of things with golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just get some lucky shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: He was he was definitely my lucky shot
because I got a way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then watching a few videos on
different styles that are people are
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he was basically with the style of
lollipopping and taking off everything all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way up to the top node and not really
going all the way down the stem,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is I've just I've just kind of
gotten better at, you know, with each grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of also using some common sense
because I know genetics, you can grow some
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff and grow some really good
material all the way down the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the stems and get some really
hard dense flowers down on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to know those genetics and we
grow different stuff in our tents every
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, I just started this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm trying new stuff and still
trying to figure out what kind what I like
[SPEAKER_00]: and what I don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm doing a lot of experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm growing something different,
usually a different phenol, a different
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, most grows and I don't know how
it's going to grow out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting those, getting the flowers all
the way to the top and not messing around
[SPEAKER_00]: with all this stuff, I've eliminated
almost completely eliminated larve in my
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, which to me, that's the number one
thing that you go for is like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wants to trim it hard, dense bud?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who wants to trim larve?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the biggest thing for me is,
you know, you're in large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself now looking forward to the
trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I look forward to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just fun trimming dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, flowers, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You won't let me trim anymore because it's
so much fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a part of quality for a lot of
people is getting those rock hard nugs
[SPEAKER_03]: versus more of a larpier structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it does come down to genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some are just going to naturally be larpy
or airy throughout the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But others, you know, with the right
conditions, with the right nutrition,
[SPEAKER_03]: lighting, so on and so forth, you can get
that quality you're looking for and even
[SPEAKER_03]: that yield you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really what this conversation
is going to be about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today, one of the things you mentioned
behind the scenes where we talk about what
[SPEAKER_03]: topics that you'd like to talk about,
you mentioned that you aim for both
[SPEAKER_03]: quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I heard that, I figured that's a
great topic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually reminded me of a video I
created, Jesus, it's got to be four or
[SPEAKER_03]: five years ago now, where I talked about
why I grow small plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things I mentioned in that
video was that I don't really need the
[SPEAKER_03]: yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I grow a bunch of different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I aim for, you know, a couple of two,
three ounces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't really focus on yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: I focus more on quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: While people took that a little sideways,
like, hey, you can get yield and quality
[SPEAKER_03]: on, you know, so I didn't need to speak it
like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the most part, having a
conversation, you can absolutely get yield
[SPEAKER_03]: and quality in the same grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're going to talk about
today, how you do that, because that is
[SPEAKER_03]: one of your common goals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, before we get into kind of the
details on that style of gardening,
[SPEAKER_03]: are you, I think you mentioned your
organic, indoors, is that your kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: grow style that you go for these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I started out growing with happy
frog and Fox farm, right off, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox farm, the ocean forest, and then they
stopped selling it in Canada last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason, it just it just and
that's kind of what I went to in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, because of course, the forums,
everybody, you know, you just go places in
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning where you're kind of
directed, you know, for soil, because you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just take some advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I used.
[SPEAKER_00]: I burned some seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, used the happy frog
in the beginning, you know, changed over
[SPEAKER_00]: using happy frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, they stopped selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did what I thought was a decent
job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started mixing my own soil using
kind of the coots, you know, method more
[SPEAKER_00]: or less, you know, everybody takes their
own spin on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've taken my own spin on it and just
started because I had to come up with a
[SPEAKER_00]: new soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This this only rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it last or the grow before something
we have something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so I basically, you know,
the coots recipe is basically a third,
[SPEAKER_00]: a third, a third, a third drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third compost and a third peat.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I basically everything I've done,
everything down, by the way, I've done
[SPEAKER_00]: everything down because I'm kind of dumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that I can understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's so I can understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost hard explaining dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me try.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take my peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually went to pro mix because it's
got the peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the it's got the perlite already
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I add.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll take two thirds of my two thirds
pro mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that's what I'll mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll put in a third a third worm
castings with some some sort of what would
[SPEAKER_00]: we call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: With some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a bag of compost laying around for
the garden for outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to throw some of that compost into
just so we mix in some more microbes or
[SPEAKER_00]: just get some stuff that that the worm
castings didn't have in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and then I'll add about a 10 percent
more perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's and then I'll put Guy Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Guy Green amendments or organic
amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use the four four four and the two
eight four and I blend them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when I do the main soil,
when I first start out with the main soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do half and half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they require three tablespoons per
gallon is what I do, except it's one and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half of each for this for the soil and let
it cook for like a month in the garage,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I find that to be a real gentle
mix for the seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I so that's starting right off
after it's cooked for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're good for seedlings and it does a
real good job on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every time I do an up pot,
I add more amendments to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm going to be doing another pot to
a one point five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I go up to the one point five
gallon, of course, that's going to be my
[SPEAKER_00]: badge and they're going to be sitting in
there for six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're going to be sitting there
for six.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did last six, seven weeks,
but probably more like six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll do dry back on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll talk about watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so then I will add four four four and
maybe like oh, maybe I'm and I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really gets going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to add less of that this
time around because I'm still trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get the recipe because I'm getting I'm
getting some tips, you know, little burn
[SPEAKER_00]: tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I start adjusting my amendments
back, I'm going to start I'm going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil perfect eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm so adjusting that my mix is back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if people come out to my show,
they'll they'll see my recipe changing a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit as we go through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The recipe is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did a better job than I I think my soil
has done a better job than it ever did
[SPEAKER_00]: with the Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it just it's Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I found a new you know,
I was forced to go outside of my little
[SPEAKER_00]: comfort zone and go do something on my
own, which is like I said, it's it's I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: really it was a huge concern, a huge worry
like doing the last grow without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I started in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I started I was going to reuse my
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that sounded like a great
idea until it until it just did a horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: job on some vegging girls that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, OK, we're only doing four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't need to save the world
by, you know, saving the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can also use it outside,
you know, for four four plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I vegged for about six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before I do my pot for my
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I add a little bit of the
284 to that as well, but not as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I when I go up to the
transition to the next pot up and I put up
[SPEAKER_00]: to seven gallon pots now and when I put up
to those, I will I'm using the same soil I
[SPEAKER_00]: started with, I'm just adding to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I will amend like I was amending
three tablespoons per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm dropping all my amendments
when I go back to reamend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm reamending at two tablespoons per
gallon instead of the three instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be using more 284.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be using like 75 percent,
80 percent, you know, 284.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll still be throwing in a
little four four four in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I of course, when I do my I
only do one I do two top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do two top dressings.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, this is what she does for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I I had two top dressings and I had the
first top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add the top dressing and then a couple
of few weeks after.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my goodness gracious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't think I do a top dressing in
veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just let it go six weeks just in that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll pot and then looking good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the third week, this is how
easy it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third week of a flower,
I think I do a top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It couldn't get any easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just couldn't get any easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This last few grows, I've experimented a
little bit with, you know, with adding
[SPEAKER_00]: things to the soil and feeding the soil
with such things as molasses, maybe making
[SPEAKER_00]: a few teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We buy we go to that the store,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The the the organic Mr. Mr. What's it
called, Mr. Fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to the store and they kind of go
like, hey, try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we I can't take I can't take her there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should just buy everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking stuff off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I'm trying to I think I'm
actually at this point allowed there
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, my girl, I'm trying to
establish a baseline of how much do I
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to put in the soil because I'm
growing some really good stuff for really
[SPEAKER_00]: the they're just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing what I want to be growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't talked about yield yet
because I'm I'm not I'm not using CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm not getting any stupid yields,
but I'm getting I'm trying for fought
[SPEAKER_00]: between five and six ounces of dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not counting larve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not counting anything else between
five and six ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get over six ounces, I feel like I've
done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And five ounces, I think, well,
you know, your genetics are just not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to some genetics are just going to give
you more than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I'm getting five ounces,
I think I've done my job with it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: with the girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like I said, I'm getting a
baseline by not admit I'm not putting
[SPEAKER_00]: anything in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't for the last few grows and I'm
really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how easy it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He stopped doing teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm thinking I will eventually once
I've really got a good baseline of what my
[SPEAKER_00]: grows are, I think I'll start maybe
feeding the soil and seeing if there's any
[SPEAKER_00]: improvements with yield or quality,
which, you know, this is kind of how and I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to think that I'm relating to a lot
of growers out there that are growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, three, four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not everybody's doing
twelve, fifteen, twenty plants or even ten
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our limit is one in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our limit is four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, I could go out there and
get a license for other, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: for for medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go out and get licensed to
probably grow more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking for another job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, what I do is what I for is enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do in the garden, but it
enables me to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you have twelve kids,
are you going to give them all what they
[SPEAKER_00]: need?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just I don't think you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have four children and you spend so
much time down there with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting they're getting so much
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is how you came up with your name
Grow Daddy, because I kind of used it when
[SPEAKER_01]: he first started growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd come.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd like run downstairs and upstairs
like, oh, the girls are doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I was like, you're just like
a daddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Listen, listen, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have I have I have two hobbies.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm retired, by the way, if I didn't
mention I'm retired, I'm retired.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I have as much passion for
both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so passionate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go around my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friends can't stand me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't stand me because this is all I
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about either growing or golf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not into one of those,
you shouldn't be in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in because I'm just going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about I'm just I get so
stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I feel I feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel dumb.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: You did a really, really good job of
explaining really nutrition, what's in
[SPEAKER_03]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're in the two thirds pro mix
third worm castings with compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some perlite in that guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: You cook for a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you're up potting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're adding more amendments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little notes here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have those memorized.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did take notes here, but I forgot a
couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We I also I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put dolomite lime in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had about a tablespoon and I didn't for
the seedlings, but I got it before I do
[SPEAKER_00]: this next up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to add some dolomite lime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what the hell it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just figure it won't hurt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I'm putting a tablespoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was good last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to stay to the same thing I
did last time, except I want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: decreasing my amendments a little bit
because I just got a little I got a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of tip burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when I get that tip burn out of
there and let me another thing about this
[SPEAKER_00]: and going on is is is all these additives
like Cal Mag and all this different stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know what a deficiency is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely don't see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't never use Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never use so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever the hell I'm doing, it's called
dummy growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have absolutely I've grown some ugly
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my first few grows with too much
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have screwed up some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start getting that light on
there right and you start giving them the
[SPEAKER_00]: right amount of water and over water and
underwater and you're stressing them out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're giving them just putting in
some decent amendments like they just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just haven't asked me for anything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't start crying.
[SPEAKER_01]: For magnesium and the Cal Mag thing,
everyone's always talking about Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're kind of going like, I think
that's a lot of synthetic growers mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, the organic route, you know,
with the guy agreeing, it's really a
[SPEAKER_03]: complete fertilizer, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fertilizer blend with all natural
organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, that gets you through the grow
without having any Cal Mag or any bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, a lot of people go that route and
they're very successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that you're in, you mentioned
seven gallon containers, a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: They often say with the organic inputs,
larger the container, the easier it is to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to grow in a 20 gallon
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would really have to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I would start at 20 gallon and
just, and water once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just do nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going to the seven gallon for me has
been perfect because I don't feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing away a lot of soil at the end of
a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet I feel like I'm able to keep my soil
as wet or as dry as I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to stimulate, I guess the microbes and
they will chop down on the amendments more
[SPEAKER_00]: and just make all the amendments more
accessible to the roots and bigger roots,
[SPEAKER_00]: more roots, big fruits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As they say.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't even know, you know,
I hear a lot of things about all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity coming out of a lot of tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of people tune into
that, you know, they hear a pound or they
[SPEAKER_00]: hear two or three pounds out of a four by
four or they hear these really huge
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers coming out of these tents and they
want to grow that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a beginner, I'll first tell you
guys, stop, stop trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, after you've, after you've,
after you've been around them for a few
[SPEAKER_00]: years, you know, I think you can start
adding CO2 and get a handle on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the biggest, and I have to
also, but I also have to say this,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the biggest, I have to mention some
of the biggest things that have changed my
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them is listening to in the
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the stupidest things get mentioned
that just get in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I haven't seen one of his videos
in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really liked him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: He means awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, by stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's the only YouTuber I really
heard and still have ever heard talk
[SPEAKER_00]: besides me, because I have mentioned it
every show now is how to read the leads.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, nobody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to do it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to come to my show to watch it,
but nobody talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody talks about reading plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that in my head,
if I would have known in the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been able to, I mean,
they talk about, okay, they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: white.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you've went past reading the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're to the stage of burning them
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they don't talk about just reading the
plants, how they, how they, how they raise
[SPEAKER_00]: up and pray if they're, if they,
if they want more light or how they're
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of leaning over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't want like reading the plants
has become so important to me in the grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it stopped me from doing a lot of
dumb stuff with lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, um, that was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentioned changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and why can't I think of his
name?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, but I owe kudos to him
because he just, he, he talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: reading the plant and I go reading the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that this is dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe people GT GT, maybe they talk
about, maybe they, I just never heard
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dummy me, I've been through,
I don't know how many grows and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at my plants and I don't know what
the hell I'm looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he mentions leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was like an aha moment because
they, they, aha moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pray.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they want more and they lie flat when
they've got enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you won't see any burning leaves in my
girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: They curl over like that when they are
getting burnt, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you, you go on the forums and what
do you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Put 2000 Watts on that, but you know,
they're just having to hammer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and as a new grower,
you hear that stuff and these guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you're out there looking like,
what light should I buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, buy something with 10,000 Watts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then turn the crank that thing up in
there and you're going to get some huge
[SPEAKER_00]: grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I heard a lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I didn't hear that, that's what I
thought I was hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I tried to kind of emulate
in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think GT just one dumb comment,
just like Mr. Bruce, your, your channel,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude, your channel, I've heard more great
Bruce Bobby, but I've heard more great
[SPEAKER_00]: tips from, from, from watching your
podcast from all the great people you've
[SPEAKER_00]: had on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've just gained so much knowledge
from growing from your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this, this channel right here than
any other channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just loved this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you Chris for having it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think you're doing a service and
I'm not just, you know, I'm just saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're doing a service to all of
us that are starting out growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: creating the culture here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're adding so much science to it,
which we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all about science, even though,
and I like to say I'm, I'm a science guy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I think Joe Rogan says it best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, I know how to use a cell phone,
but I couldn't build it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, and a lot of these
guys, a lot of these guys are,
[SPEAKER_00]: are scientists that are growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're mixing all these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty spunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm also talking about just YouTubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're watching YouTubers, they're
mixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing this stuff for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're adding, you know, this much to
this and they know the PM pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they get, they got to cut back on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was too much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way too much for my head,
too much work.
[SPEAKER_00]: When am I going to have time to golf?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to, I got to study this stuff,
you know, so growing in soil to me was
[SPEAKER_00]: just so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could tell any beginner,
if I could tell, and I know this is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a closing question, but if I
could tell any beginner anything,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell a beginner to grow,
start in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to tell them to start in
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else is just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just got to be, feel a little dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I appreciate your positive words
about the podcast.
[SPEAKER_03]: That really does give me fuel to keep on
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the whole reason why I do is just
try to spread information, good
[SPEAKER_03]: information and get folks from all
experience levels on the podcast because I
[SPEAKER_03]: believe that even some beginners,
there's takeaways for some stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, even if you just, even if you're
very experienced and you hear a beginner
[SPEAKER_03]: talking, you might hear something that
they say that kind of brings you back
[SPEAKER_03]: like, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been ignoring that part.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me, let me start focusing back on that
part again.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyways, thank you so much for your,
your feedback there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just, it's, I could go on
and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I know I've said,
I wasn't going to be a huge fan boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I can't help it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't help it, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't help it, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you're just, you bring, you bring so
much, you know what I have told everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: to tell everybody that all my buddies that
I'm golfing with, you know, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking, God, no, not again.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to talk about his grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be on a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be on Mr. Grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like a Wayne's world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're not worthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, we do, when we do our
show, we are trying to do some edutainment
[SPEAKER_00]: as well to bring people, you know,
to the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all, that's all, that's all Mrs.
Grow daddy right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is, and she's, she's motivated by
people liking our show and that really
[SPEAKER_00]: motivates her to do the editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard you talk about editing that you
were over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've heard, you know,
I've heard every word you say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard you say, I'm stalking you
kind of, but you know, so I've heard you
[SPEAKER_00]: say that you're over the editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get, listen, I don't want any part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm with you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got other things to do, but she's
kind of the geek in our relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's kind of geeky into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyways, we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of fun stuff and grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to add to that, just to add to
it, this grow has helped us in coming
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this not weird?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, oh, I'm not kidding because you
know, we, we lead separate lives in some
[SPEAKER_00]: ways, you know, she's off on her computer
doing her geeky things and I'm out playing
[SPEAKER_00]: golf and I'm, you know, we just,
but down in the grow room, we find each
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do a film day, we do our filming
on usually Tuesdays and we do our film
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to spend the whole day together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it's a collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know, but we've had to
learn to work together because she's got
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with a diva and I've got to learn
to deal with, I'm learning to deal with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to say a, a producer,
a director and uptight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might add a little uptight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call it a predator, you know,
like a producer editor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, you know, like just keep that
shorter or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: She brings me around because I'm like,
no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, we, I ended up, I'm learning
that if I just do it her way, it comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just got to keep my mouth shut
because I'm a personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like to do things my way all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I just have to give away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that's for the better,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to bring it back and talk about,
you touched upon a little bit about
[SPEAKER_03]: watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered nutrition, what you're using
for container size and so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_03]: but kind of directly relating to that is
watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your water source and how do you go
about watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my water source is good here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you mentioned, you got this pretty
crappy water source where you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have tap water that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I think it's like 26 PPM,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think 26, I think it's like 26
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 40, it's really not big of a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes out clean, pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think on my first green,
on my first grow, I don't think I filtered
[SPEAKER_00]: any of it or I should say I didn't do
anything to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just ordered it right out of the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look at those plants are
unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't do a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could give them justice after that,
but that actually, that was just regular
[SPEAKER_00]: tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself using, what is that called?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's called acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the uses vitamin C powder,
which is sorbic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use that to take the chloramine,
which we have chloramines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that to get the chloramine out of
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also drops the pH down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the big controversy now has been,
you know, doesn't make a difference what
[SPEAKER_00]: your pH is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the new controversy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know, but I do know that I try
to do what the internet has kind of told
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do YouTubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to keep it around 65, you know,
pH, and I try to get it down there
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I almost don't care, but I do get,
I do use, I bought a pH pin, so I might as
[SPEAKER_00]: well use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I spent some money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about the only thing I use my pH
pin for is adjusting my water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest with you, if it's below
seven and above five, I mean, I really
[SPEAKER_00]: don't care, but I really, I get it out of
the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I'm long winded here, but I get it
out of the tap at probably a little above
[SPEAKER_00]: eight, five, maybe going into eight,
I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I bring it down to under seven,
maybe six and a half, and then throw it in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you said, talked about also the
watering habits that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The watering habits, when I first started
out, I was in five gallon, three gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some experimenting with different
size pots and it was dry back for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't recommend doing those smaller pots
without doing it any other way is dry
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have learned a little something,
you know, drying them back doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: drying them out completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't think I really knew that
until I started with these bigger pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: started and stressed out my, I think my
first time I grew in those pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: I stressed my girls out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me some seeds and I only go
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do do dry back on my new pots,
my seven gallon pots, I try to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: wet most of the time and I will do dry
back on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used a blue mat moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really recommend getting a moisture
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of little things that I
bought for my grow that I was really,
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think I waited to buy, you know,
thinking I could get by without them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, I don't like buying stuff and
I don't like putting extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many gadgets and gimmicks out
there and different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think I just dive in on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I really take my time and getting
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're the reason why I bought my blue
mat, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching a podcast where you were
talking about the blue mat moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you didn't have one yet,
but you were talking about buying one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course I got to have what Mr.
Groen has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to get them, so I bought one
and then I discovered when I bought it
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, big old, huge carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, it's so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expected to have something I was going
to be putting in each bag and checking the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil on, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in for a penny in for a pound,
give me another three of those because now
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to get to my other containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find myself drying out my container
when I'm doing dry back on them to about
[SPEAKER_00]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I leave about 20, 25% of water
in there when I do a dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how I, we were talking about,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM or PM or whatever it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pest management?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only pests I've ever had in my
grow really are gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we've had it, we've had a
few seasons where it was a big joke
[SPEAKER_00]: because I thought I handled it with a
mosquito dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, it was just a dry back
that got rid of my Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next season, so here I have this
big old huge tray of these dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mosquito dunks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell the world, I'm just
going to tell the world how I fixed gnats
[SPEAKER_00]: in your tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell the world how you do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just through these mosquito
dunks, you know, and I soaked them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the PPMs way up on these,
on the mixtures of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went, one of my girls suffered,
okay, because I don't think, I think they
[SPEAKER_00]: were drinking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absolutely wasn't killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used it many, I've used it from the
time they were seedlings, basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I brought gnats in as stupid as
that sound, because I wanted to show how
[SPEAKER_01]: easy it is to get rid of the gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started, so I started, and this is
what you can't do when you're only going
[SPEAKER_00]: four plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also trying to create content,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm trying to create some content,
but not ruin my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so important to me to get my,
my yield and my, my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I stunted one of my girls doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had the gnats, they were flying
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, it was Lily.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I went off on a rant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oh, so anyway, so going back to
watering, how I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in watering, so anyways, I like the
seven gallons for growing organically and
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to put a moisture meter in
there of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily, you know,
the blue mat's working great for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does, it works excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there's other moisture meters
out there that work just as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, it's better to keep all those
little microbes in the soil active using,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, keeping it moist all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got really into the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the, you know, I made, made microbe
TV because it's really cool to look at
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to say I keep, I try to keep
my pot moist when I get them in the seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm driving, I'm, I'm doing dry back
in the seedlings stage all the way from
[SPEAKER_00]: the solo 1.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get into the seven gallon pot,
I like to keep the moisture at about 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I water to 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next day I come in and you
know, if they're, if they're drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: water, it's going down to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm adding 25% keeping it, but,
and that's about what the blue mat
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meter, that's what enables me to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I see on that problem now,
I know how to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, if I didn't mention those
mosquito, I must've used 20 of them that
[SPEAKER_00]: season, 30 of those things, they just
don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried them every which way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about, forget about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've conclusively proven those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not do squat, but dry back will take
away your gnats almost immediately while
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they take two weeks to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done my study and I'm gonna do
some bottom watering while I do all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of dumb stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do all kinds of dumb stuff because I
have a moisture meter and I'm able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what makes me be able to do it
because I can put a moisture meter in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and go, okay, I'm down to 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see, I see some flying around,
so I'll just bottom water them for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just hit them on the bottom and
get them back up there and, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure the soil on the top the
first couple inches doesn't really have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to really get wet again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll dry it out for this top of it for
a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I don't see anything flying
around in there, I know it's safe again to
[SPEAKER_00]: get my 75% water back in those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel, I feel like this has been just
worked out really good for getting rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats and not stressing out my plants at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't, they don't suffer at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get rid of the gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has just been the best thing,
the best way for me to, to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moisture level in the medium is so
important when it comes to quality and
[SPEAKER_03]: yield, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have too much moisture in the
medium, you're going to stunt your growth
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're going to hurt your yield,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Too dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lack of access to that nutrition,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool that you actually are
using the Blue Mat Moisture Meter because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to dive a little bit deeper into
that, it has a millibar reading on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Blue Mat recommends,
correct me if I'm wrong, was a 50 to a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred millibar in order to have,
that's like their optimal moisture level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now some people will dial it into 80 or a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the higher it goes,
the more drier it is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will basically, when I water it,
I will water, it says saturated,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know what's in the soil because
same, those seven gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: they take approximately two gallons of
water, eight quarts, eight liters,
[SPEAKER_00]: whichever way you want to look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's saturated to what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know, I know if I dry those things
out, I mean completely because I did that
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow before I completely, I mean until
they were, until my plants were drooping,
[SPEAKER_00]: dried it out completely, the seven gallon
pot, they will literally take two gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: about to make it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, when I do a full watering on my
plants, let me try to get this,
[SPEAKER_00]: my head straight wrapped around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do a full watering from dry back
now, when I do dry back on those,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get them completely saturated where I
have any runoff, I'm only adding six
[SPEAKER_00]: quarts, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know, there's 20%, so I'm not going
completely down on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely important, like you said,
and I have noticed through veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: and through veg, that's when you notice
all the growth, keeping those girls wet
[SPEAKER_00]: has just stimulated the growth so much on
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's helping the
microbes, they're not going into a dormant
[SPEAKER_00]: state anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got that, you know,
before when you're doing dry back and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry back's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of people that have been
growing for 30, 40 years doing dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works for them and they're growing
with smaller containers and probably using
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetics and quite honestly,
and probably, you know, running off on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and doing other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just let that pot soak it right back
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not measuring PPMs coming out at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, then once I water it completely
and saturate it, of course, the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: from watering the seven gallon,
it's still going to show saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be only at, it's going to be
probably 50 millibars, even the next day
[SPEAKER_00]: after it's saturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes two days to bring it back to
the 75, you know, that 75 or even to the
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 where you want to water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when it gets down for me,
when I come into the grow room and see it
[SPEAKER_00]: really 120, if it's 120 millibars,
I'm kind of looking at it like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my goodness, it's not, it doesn't,
if it needs to be watered, it's only like
[SPEAKER_00]: one quart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually when watering is really going
for me in the grow, it's a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: quarts a day in each of those bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I come in, the millibar will
go from saturated the day before,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I put 75, filled it up 75%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will go to somewhere between usually
around 180 to 300, you know, dependent to
[SPEAKER_00]: 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that doesn't necessarily mean it is
drinking more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep such a good chart of drinking
and I've really learned how to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some girls, when they're drinking
more, it's, and it says 300, it only wants
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple, a couple, what would you call a
liter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a couple, what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but not a whole liter, just a
couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ounces?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like a couple ounces above.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been, like I said, when you do
use one of these meters, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, you know, your children,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know, your children,
you know, you're just so dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you're reading that and it's
giving you an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look on what, what you
watered it at when it was at 300 millibars
[SPEAKER_00]: to bring it where you want it,
what you watered it when it was at 200
[SPEAKER_00]: millibars.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep some notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we do have seven day average now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's been, he actually keeps track of
how much water he puts in every day and
[SPEAKER_01]: what the millibars said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do kind of, we keep a spreadsheet
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we kind of, we started doing this
last row with the moisture meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started doing a seven day average for
each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another thing I would probably
suggest to anybody is write stuff down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's been the best thing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually we, hey, if you're,
we have a spreadsheet that we do on our
[SPEAKER_00]: show and I'm proud to do it because we're
so, we're so, I want to say trans,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're so transparent on our grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be, because we want people,
we want to help new growers and maybe give
[SPEAKER_00]: a few ideas to a couple old growers,
I guess, you know, on different styles or
[SPEAKER_00]: different growing, but we really want to
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think I want to, I want to help
me when I first started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who I'm really talking to every
week on our podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is I'm talking to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was looking on YouTube and
different forms, I would find some bits
[SPEAKER_00]: and bits and bits and bits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't described well enough for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't because I'm dumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need everything step-by-step and I just
feel like it's missing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, I mean, Mr. Canuck get the hell
out of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the biggest guy on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to do videos every six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I found first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who I found first because I
remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started growing with Guy Green
after my first or second grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing with Guy Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You research Guy Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who the hell is going with Guy Green?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to know how to use this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I looked up his show and I remember
looking up his show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his editing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I love everything about his
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't love about him is
the magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's magic in his, there's magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something he's missing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what he's missing,
but he's missing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of magic and I didn't
want to be that YouTuber that didn't let
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody know every single detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a spreadsheet and you can find it
in our, in our description.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and it's, it's, it's watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of for us, it helps us because
it kind of gives a timeline, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for like, okay, so for up potting for what
week of a veg we're in or whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of gives us a timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, these ones, these plants are doing a
little better than last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last season or ooh, these ones are slower
and we can kind of see from the,
[SPEAKER_01]: what day we're on, what day of the grow,
how the plants look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very detailed though.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that only, not only helps people that
are interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only helps people that are interested
in what I'm doing and want to know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how much that means to me
because like I said, I just, if I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have exact, then I'm now, I am just trying
to go off of what dumb dumps might do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm trying to have exact,
exactly what people are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got plenty of competition in the
dumb, dumb arena here because I have
[SPEAKER_01]: always had the black thumb of death in the
garden basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned a lot, you know,
about all the things that I've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong all my life with the plants killed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have, I have found our spreadsheets
in, which I didn't know because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: never detailing everything so much,
but I have found my spreadsheets
[SPEAKER_00]: invaluable for my own growing of what I
did, what weak things happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: where things were at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we do the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can actually see the plants at
where they were on this day, which,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's just huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So us doing the, the whole thing has just
been good for us and hopefully good for
[SPEAKER_00]: people that would like to have,
you know, some, some good medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, and, and a lot of it,
like I said, we're growing for yield and
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to go back to Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about growing for yield
and that's where he taught me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think we, we, we sketched on
it, but what he taught me was about,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, about lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talked, he mentioned some different
things on the show the other day,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but I was probably watching
something old that he did and we all just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of, you know, move around and change
things as we, as we go through life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I w I've been following what he taught
me when I first looked at this video five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically, yeah, let me take a
breath and stop talking for one second.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But plant training, I'm glad you're
transitioning to that because that's kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of where I wanted to go next is what do
you do for plant training in order to
[SPEAKER_03]: achieve high quality in order to get a
higher yield?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully you caught your breath by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to say, I would have to say I
first started on, uh, forums and different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and looking at different plants and
looking to see what I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just, for some reason, I love to see
the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just love to see that level
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what sticks in my head and I
know it's an iconic where you see the
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of the outdoor medicinal plant and
it's a hedge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have to have seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a million pictures, different
pictures of people growing hedges and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought to myself, God, that looks
so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to grow that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, the common sense of
it, of getting everything to the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and finding out that the par is
the par is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all getting the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get all these colas,
all these tops, all to the top,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody's being treated special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of a way of bonsai and what
you guys talked a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: other day with Kyle Krishman, which I
thought was kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonsai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love the bonsai.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love all the cool stuff I see in that
people have time for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm too busy playing golf, but love
looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the art.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is kind of my art as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being able to get the flattest canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't always, I'm not always able to
achieve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not always able to make it look as
perfect as Sedna last season.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sedna was just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just gave me this flat, beautiful
looking canopy, which for me, I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not all like that,
but I'm striving for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets everything to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kyle Krishman, of course, helped me in
this way of trimming, taking off all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes all the way up to the top and,
you know, taking off all those bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the video that I watched and I've
rewatched it, he says all the way to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top, all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have some big kahunas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have huge kahunas to take all
those nodes to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think of it like, you got to have
faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have some faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to have some, I want to say you
have to have almost religion to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped me because when I grew my
first crop, I think I was a little dumb
[SPEAKER_00]: about it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Kyle Krishman says to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up getting some growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't clean it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I clean my new ones off now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see on my new, on my first grow,
you see stuff going down, but he had
[SPEAKER_00]: everything going up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I use some common sense depending
on how far, how far they are spaced on the
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's some far spacing, I don't want
to grow anything that's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want everything to not only connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost, when I get to the, when I get to
the stage of trimming everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I don't want to be peeling off
things that aren't, you know, tight,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know how you're peeling off lower,
lower buds because they're not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: connected, but they're, they're still hard
and they're still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to get all those hard ones
as much as I can that are going to connect
[SPEAKER_00]: up on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use some common sense, like some plants
I will take all the way up to the top
[SPEAKER_00]: because I feel you bring the energy and
Kyle Krishman said it best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken all that energy from the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring it up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You give them those top, all the good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, they end up growing,
but I have also found they, I also found
[SPEAKER_00]: that and I have a goal of getting 50 buds
in a two by two space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, bud site.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to, a bud site was a huge thing
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we, we thought we, we had too many at
50, but now I made a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made a mistake on, on one of my grows
where I grew, I grew, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did a lot of just pinching
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small, small bud syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it small, small bud syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the whole thing on that because I
had small bud syndrome that season and it
[SPEAKER_00]: ended up everything, everything got about,
I got about five ounces of plant and they
[SPEAKER_00]: were just little tiny plants, you know,
because I, uh, I pinched a lot of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I went into transition too soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing took off, nothing, nothing,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they all, it just stayed like a little,
like a little, you know, like a little
[SPEAKER_00]: dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these flowers were just like a
little dome there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was really tight and there was
50 bud sites on each of these,
[SPEAKER_00]: on each of these plants and they were all
really small and a, but, but because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was so small, I did pinch them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pinched every one of these plants all
the way to the top and they got all these
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little tops on and I was just,
I went through the whole season going,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, I really, I really messed up the
yield on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I really messed up the yield,
but we actually were, we were,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were, we were pretty, pretty besides,
besides we had a stunted runt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was Lily that, that seeing we
name our plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was Lily that girl was
stunted because of the gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we only got three plants that we
really, but Lily looked great,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she ended up just completely being
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, she actually came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think the gnats got to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they did, they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was obviously stunted, but we thought
she, she grew some really nice looking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, uh, flowers and we thought she'd
be huge in fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought they were going to be
really, really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they dried out, they were just,
just, they were just flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, we, I take that myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was me and my, and my grow,
but nevertheless, now we grow and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: let everything veg out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uh, last, last season, everything
vegged out to six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one tent, I would have won
another week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I grew a tent that I would have
won another weekend, but the other tent
[SPEAKER_00]: was so, it was just, it was just going
wild after six weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just couldn't hold that one back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really liked the flower,
everything at the same time and go into
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole grow at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to flower the other tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so, um, anyway, so we,
uh, I think I want to just finish this by
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, we try to veg them out and really
let them grow out to their two by two,
[SPEAKER_00]: their two by, they each get a two by two
spot in my two by four grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each of them get a two by two spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to really let them veg out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six, maybe seven weeks, uh, where they're
looking like they're taking up the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we, then we, then we flip them
and we let them grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we're, we're like, I pinched,
like I pinched, like nobody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I got, I just pitch and I figure I got,
I think I got about two pinches besides
[SPEAKER_00]: the top, the first time I think I got
about two pinches after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just try to let the plant do what
it's going to do, come up and try to,
[SPEAKER_00]: and try, try to, try to use some common
sense on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the nodes are close enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where we keep it too,
is we want those, we want those to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't, we just go to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's going to go to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get, hopefully six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I get cocky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully six ounces on every plant,
but I'll tell you what, if we get five,
[SPEAKER_00]: we feel pretty, pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's all dense, we feel pretty good
with five ounces on a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not using any, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, I think I, and try to get that
flat canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a lot of wire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just got to come see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's almost no way to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost have to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really enjoys the, the, um,
like the, the, the bonsai-ing of it all,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the pinching and the defoli,
the tucking and the taking care and like
[SPEAKER_01]: he'll go, come look at this canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my favorite time in the grow is
when I get to do all this manipulating of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really when they're, when they're
like right now, they're just, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in solo cups about ready to be up
potted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go down and I watered them twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then they're going to go
into the 1.5s again, you do dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm starting to, when they get in the
next one, I'm going to start bending them
[SPEAKER_00]: over and start training them immediately
when they get in those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start the training and that's when
it starts getting fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they get bigger and I have to
spend more time down there, I start
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to my girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a good time down there throwing a
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and the girls have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely, by the end of this grow,
I'm in love with four new girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't mind, do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm absolutely in love with them because
we, we go through and we talk about them
[SPEAKER_00]: and for us, they're only almost,
they really are our little children.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of immortalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody loves,
loves their girls like we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just, we love our girls every season.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's heartbreaking at the end when you
get to chop them down, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I, and when I do, when I do give
away my girls, because I do, I grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow enough for me and hopefully enough
for some of my golf buddies and some
[SPEAKER_00]: friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually don't even tell them what
the strain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them their names.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is Diana.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, this is like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, I have what we,
and we have a different theme every grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I don't even tell them what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them the girls names because to me,
that's who these girls are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this, this season, you guys,
we're going to let you in on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've seen a couple episodes,
we got girls, we got girls, we got,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've, girls are going to be talking to me
this season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I can't wait for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go out and have a conversation,
but, and I can hear that nobody else can,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Mrs. Grow Daddy, she has given them
all voices this next season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you did some AI generated
characters, you know, like I saw that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: our idea of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're always looking to, we're always
looking to entertain as well as maybe help
[SPEAKER_00]: people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the fun of our show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really, that's,
that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, and to be quite honest,
I don't think if we were doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we were, if we were doing this kind of
content, we would really keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're doing it because we really
enjoy doing it from each of our aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allie's just, she's just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, she is without her, there would be no
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why she's here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If any of you are thinking without it's us
and without her, there's no show.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no show.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys will be watching me with some
stupid camera in my face or some camera
[SPEAKER_00]: going like this, which I see some
successful shows, but to be quite honest,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just couldn't do it without her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't do it without her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just love, I love what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love, look at me, I'm talking to
Chris.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your show is really enjoyable and
informative as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's something that I've been tuning into
quite recently and I look forward to your
[SPEAKER_03]: future content here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we could go on and on and on and talk,
continue to talk about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: lighting, environment, IPM, harvest dry
care, but the conversation would be three
[SPEAKER_03]: hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the way it's gone, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're right, we can tune into my
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope people tune into my show that want
to hear more about, you know, more about
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but God, this has been just
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so nervous to even come on and
it just, I mean, look at me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a big old, he's fan boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what I'd do with Mr. Canuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Canuck, I don't know what I'd do if he
did podcasts, I'd absolutely go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd go crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was the first guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I love his podcast amongst
other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love a lot of podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't have a garden talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's, this one is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and you know, I tune, and to be quite
honest, I tune into his to watch his
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just does such a great job growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do all of our, like almost
everybody that we learn about,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we find on your, on your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like everybody from beginner
to advanced is just like watching your
[SPEAKER_01]: show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We found a few people, but I tell you
what, um, we found a few people on our
[SPEAKER_00]: own, but I think, I think you've directed
us to more people and more great
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and we've got a discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should probably mention that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, why don't we wrap
things up here, give you a chance to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: people how they could find you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is grow daddy.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is horseshoe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're on a YouTube at youtube.com
forward slash grow daddy TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got a discord.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a whole bunch of other links to
the, you'll find there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, discord's growing by the way,
just to let you guys know, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, we're a small show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only got a couple thousand,
um, subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of a small show,
just still trying to get our feet wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, Oh, see, there I go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell was I doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, I lose it just like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You missed grow daddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where was I at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Help me out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dying here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you wanted to mention a discord,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wanted to mention discord because I,
I, you know, we don't have a lot of guys
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, but we do have guys in there and
they come from all different aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, um, hydro and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, got a lot of good grow
growers in there, not to mention good
[SPEAKER_00]: place to, you know, show your plants and
get some good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you what, I'm not going to
let anybody get you in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ain't going to be like any other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go in there, I go in there and read
almost everything and I make sure nobody's
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, bull people, people that you
need a thousand Watts to grow in a two by
[SPEAKER_00]: two or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not doing kind of on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has to be nice and polite to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not honest and polite,
she, she takes care of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's definitely, she's definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything unsure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you having us on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been, it's been an honor for me to be
on your show in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope, um, what can I say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy, happy growing for everybody out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a fun conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I mentioned, we can go on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we need to get you back on for a
part two at some point this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever want me back on, I'll be back
on here in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you can handle me,
Chris, your editor is going to be so busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your editor is going to be busy.

[SPEAKER_03]: Love reading those comments and then,
um, seeing if there's any takeaways that I
[SPEAKER_03]: can do within my garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Patrick, Mrs. Grow Daddy, thank you so
