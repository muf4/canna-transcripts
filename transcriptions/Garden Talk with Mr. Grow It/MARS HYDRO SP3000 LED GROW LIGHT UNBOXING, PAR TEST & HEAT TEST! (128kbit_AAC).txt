[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're watching Max's channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mars Hydro sent me over their new
growlite, the SP3000 LED growlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this video I'm going to unboxing it,
I am going to test the power output,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go over all of the
growlite's features in this video,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I will leave a link down in the
description section below if you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn more about it, such as what diodes
are used, driver, spectrum, so on and so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, first thing out the box is a user
manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: This includes information such as assembly
instructions, dimming operation,
[SPEAKER_01]: some grow tips, some safety information,
and information on their warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next out the box is two rope ratchet
hangers, and in this bag is also two metal
[SPEAKER_01]: brackets for hanging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've included a sheet of stickers,
and here's the fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and they've also included an ethernet
cable.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the power test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Power Meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers, and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_01]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do these videos just to give you a
general idea of what the power output is,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls, that could increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers, so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowering coverage area for this
growlite is 2 feet by 5 feet, but Mars
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydro mentioned that this would do great
in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually sent me over two of these
growlites, and they've requested that I
[SPEAKER_01]: take measurements in a 4 foot by 4 foot
grow tent, so you can see what the power
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements are in that size grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want me to do another video where I
take measurements in a 2 foot by 4 foot
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent, let me know down in the comment
section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: This LED growlite does have a dimmer on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the measurements, I'll set the dimmer
to 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've plugged the LED growlite into my
kilowatt meter, and it shows 2.45 amps
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling 290 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this growlite down in the description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below, so you can learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty much it for this video guys,
if you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
[SPEAKER_01]: up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
