[SPEAKER_00]: What is up everybody feel that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and today
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a product unboxing video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who've been following my
channel for a while know that I've grown
[SPEAKER_00]: with the California Lightworks Solar
System 1100 LED grow light in two of my
[SPEAKER_00]: past grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very satisfied with the results I
got from using that light and California
[SPEAKER_00]: Lightworks decided to sponsor this video
and send me over their new light the Solar
[SPEAKER_00]: Extreme 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video we're going to unboxing it
and we'll also talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Solar Extreme 500 is a full spectrum
LED grow light designed especially for
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tents and small scale home growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I measured the unit and the dimensions are
19.25 inches by 9 inches by 4 inches and
[SPEAKER_00]: the fixture weighs 11 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light is good for all stages
of growing from seedling through
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a coverage area of full foot by
full foot when the plants are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage and 5 foot by 5 foot when
the plants are in the vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Simplicity is one word that I'd use to
describe this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no switches, knobs, or dimmer to
make adjustments.
[SPEAKER_00]: You simply hang the light using the
supplied hooks in your choice of light
[SPEAKER_00]: hangers and then plug the unit into the
wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow light consists of eight
high-efficient cobb LEDs and uses new
[SPEAKER_00]: direct AC drive technology which
eliminates the need for a separate LED
[SPEAKER_00]: driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: This combination results in not only less
energy draw, it consumes only 400 watts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also allows the unit to be sold at
a much lower cost than other LEDs that
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: California Lightwork lists a few different
PPFD measurements for this LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the grow light is hanging at a
distance of 18 inches, PPFD is 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the light is hanging at a distance of
24 inches, PPFD comes in at 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the screen right now is the light
spectrum emitted from this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: California Lightworks calls this the Solar
Extreme Opti-Grow Full Spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fixture uses 3.3 amps at 120 volts.
[SPEAKER_00]: For thermal management, this unit has a
large aluminum heat sink and two active
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way they work is air will come in
through the top of the fixture and then
[SPEAKER_00]: blow out of the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat output on this unit is 1280 BTU.
[SPEAKER_00]: California Lightworks warns that all of
their Solar Extreme Series grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: will be free from defects in material and
workmanship for a period of one year from
[SPEAKER_00]: the date of purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also offer a full satisfaction 90-day
money-back guarantee on all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a few other lights in this
series.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Solar Extreme 250 covers a three foot
by three foot area and the Solar Extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: 1000 covers a five foot by five foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have a factory tour video on
the YouTube page which I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video in the description
section below for those of you who want to
[SPEAKER_00]: see how their grow lights are made.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been in business since 2009 and
all of their products are made in the USA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost for the Solar Extreme 500 is $449
and they provided a discount code for my
[SPEAKER_00]: viewers.
