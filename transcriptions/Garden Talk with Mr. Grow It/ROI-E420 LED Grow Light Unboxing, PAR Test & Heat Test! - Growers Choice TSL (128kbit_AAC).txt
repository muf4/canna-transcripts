[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. GrowIt, and you'll watch on
[SPEAKER_00]: my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have a brand new LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was just released today for 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ROI E420 LED grow light,
and this is by Growers Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over this grow light in order
to do this video right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I am going to unbox the
unit so you'll see what comes in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also test the power output and I'll
do a heat test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about the grow
light's features like I do in some of my
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, but what I will do is leave a link
to this grow light in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below so you can learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also leave a discount code down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discount code MRGROWIT will give you a
percentage off, so I just wanted to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a heads up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so first thing out the box is a user
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This user manual has a ton of good
information about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next is a 120-240 volt adapter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is a bag with two rope ratchets in
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another bag with two more rope ratchets,
so they include four rope ratchets total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly is the fixture, and the power
cord is actually attached to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test, I'm going to use the
Abogee MQ500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389nm to 692nm,
and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these power test videos just to give
you a general idea of what the power
[SPEAKER_00]: output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take these power measurements in grow
tents, which have reflective walls that
[SPEAKER_00]: could increase the numbers, so just keep
that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Auro IE420 has a flowering coverage
area of 3 foot by 3 foot, but I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: a 3 foot by 3 foot grow tent, so I'm going
to take measurements in a 4 foot by 4 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent, and I'll do my best to keep my
power meter in a 3 foot by 3 foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: In their instruction manual, they don't
say what the light distance should be for
[SPEAKER_00]: the different stages of growth,
but after putting my power meter under the
[SPEAKER_00]: light, 12 inches, 18 inches, and 24 inches
seem to be the proper distances for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages of growth, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light does have a dimmer on it,
but I'll take the measurements when the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmer is set to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I've plugged the light into the
kilowatt meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows 3.63 amps, pulling 440 watts from
the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link for
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below, along with the discount code,
and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
