[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grassroots Fabric Pots sent me over a
custom 2 foot by 10 foot raised bed and I
[SPEAKER_00]: figured I'd film a video of me assembling
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this certainly isn't your typical
fabric grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use moisture lock technology on all
of their living soil pots and beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what that is is they use a piece
of waterproof fabric around the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: container but they leave a four inch
aeration strip at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this does is it directs moisture
to better simulate the way root systems
[SPEAKER_00]: dry in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you water the waterproof fabric
prevents water from draining through the
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It directs it downwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fittings that I'm showing on the
screen right now they do send them over
[SPEAKER_00]: with the fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did have to go to my local hardware
store and buy PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up buying four pieces of 10
foot PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I spent like $2.50 for each 10
foot piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one inch PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also need to purchase a PVC pipe cutter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this one from my local hardware
store but I'll provide an Amazon link in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the products shown are mentioned in
this video will be linked in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll need this drill with a Phillips head
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do include the bag of screws here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the PVC is secured in the fittings I
will use these screws to secure them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last but not least I will of
course need the instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so following the instructions the
first thing I need to do is size out the
[SPEAKER_00]: legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just placing one of the 10 foot
pieces of PVC up measuring it out and then
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to use that piece that I
cut to size out the remaining legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this 2 foot by 10 foot bed I'm going
to need 8 legs.
[SPEAKER_00]: After cutting all the legs with my PVC
pipe cutter I'm putting each leg into its
[SPEAKER_00]: fitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next I'm going to size up the frames
crossbars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm putting a piece of uncut PVC through
the bed's sleeve and cutting at the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical marking indicated on the
instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using another one of the legs as a
guide so I know where to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've cut the PVC I'll use this
length to make as many crossbars as I
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my case here with a 2 foot by 10 foot
bed I'll need 6 pieces this size.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I've attached those crossbars to the
legs I need to size up and cut the
[SPEAKER_00]: remaining crossbars which of course are of
a smaller size.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've cut the 4 pieces of this size which
is needed for this size bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to attach these pieces to
their fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly I'll use the provided screws to
secure the pipes and the fittings.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the instructions it says you can use a
mallet to seat the PVC into each fitting
[SPEAKER_00]: for a snug fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't need to do that mine slid in
without issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright everything is complete here is the
final result.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bed is now ready to be filled with
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys
if you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: you
