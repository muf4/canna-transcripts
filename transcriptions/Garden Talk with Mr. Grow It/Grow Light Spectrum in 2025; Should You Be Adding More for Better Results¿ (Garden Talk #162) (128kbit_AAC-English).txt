[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening, and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 162.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Josh Granbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 12 years,
and is the producer for both the Dude Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Show and the Jug Dealers podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granbo studies a lot of different things,
one of them being lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in 2025, what should you look for in
a grow light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is supplementing Far Red worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is supplementing UV worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into all of that plus more in this
episode.

Granbo.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very well, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to have you on the podcast today to
talk all about lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that has changed so much
over the years, and now we're in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: year, 2025, and I can't wait to pick your
brain on things to kind of look for in a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be getting into so many
different topics that relate to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned to me that you've been doing
a lot of research on it, so I'm eager to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear kind of some of the things that
you've found out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the thing about it is that this is
the, you know, it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing has been growing for,
you know, hundreds of thousands,
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's not a ton of new science
that comes out week to week as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, the actual, like, oh, we found out
there's a new nutrient, riboflavin,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and he's more riboflavin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it's one of those
things, like, how do you keep up with
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that changes week to
week is not only the technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: of lighting, obviously, with all the
different tech that comes out,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also the science of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the least understood aspects
of lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we were talking about what we
wanted to talk about, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I'm super hyped on not just the
lighting and the technology, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction, your PPFDs, your DLIs,
how these different lighting cycles affect
[SPEAKER_01]: what the plant does, how it produces
biomass versus the VOCs, the volatile
[SPEAKER_01]: organic compounds that we all like to
consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's pretty much been my
obsession over the last little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was stoked to get to talk about it
with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before we get too deep into
lighting, can we do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as some of you may know, my name is
Josh Granbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a comedian here in Denver,
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been touring the country for the last
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've been, you know, a consumer
my whole life, my entire, literally my
[SPEAKER_01]: entire, not even my entire adult life,
even going into my adolescent life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's always provided for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every turn, every turn I go, it just
seemed like when I was in high school and
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know where my friend group was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, I found these super cool
guys that are all enjoyed the same sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, skateboarding and hanging out and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants are right there as part of
the lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I need to get out of Iowa where
I'm born.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the band Slipknotts hometown of
Des Moines, Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I got to watch those guys flower
and leave eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still have houses there, but it was
very, you know, inspiring to watch these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys that I was a freshman to their
senior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always say, I know them, but they
don't know me sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had to watch them go from Des Moines
and step up to the big leagues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned that if you put in work,
you can actually do things in this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that led me to getting out of Des
Moines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a refugee, essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left Des Moines so I could go to
Colorado and, you know, start a family and
[SPEAKER_01]: be safe and work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I never, I fortunately never had
any serious interaction with the officials
[SPEAKER_01]: out in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to get away scot-free out of
a prohibition land, as we call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I got to Colorado,
it's very, very expensive here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to get around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, the plants provided a way
in again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the bottom started falling out
of the market and everything started kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of changing and going the way of,
you know, what is happening now that the
[SPEAKER_01]: butterfly cocoon into corporate world that
we're going into.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't that the profit incentive
will say to do it the way I had always
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I stepped away and I was like,
let me start doing comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went and I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do it like at the arena level,
but I, you know, I started grinding my way
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes years and years of grinding that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after a big road trip, I did a
five-week tour all across America,
[SPEAKER_01]: started in Florida, ended in Utah,
zigzag from Maine to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iowa, Minnesota, every, you know,
I think we did 28 states and 35 nights had
[SPEAKER_01]: the most fun of my entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we made good money on the trip and I
came home $300 in the negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, when I get back to
Denver, I got to figure out like something
[SPEAKER_01]: that can like be my, my, you know,
supplement, like the real thing that I can
[SPEAKER_01]: do to make money and kind of provide,
you know, going room to room, play into 50
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But actually like being able to start a
community of my own and just so happens
[SPEAKER_01]: the week that I got back, the dude grow
show, which I had been a big fan of lost
[SPEAKER_01]: their producer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had over the lockdown and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: When standup got taken away, I kind of
gave myself a mini film school education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the outside of that, I didn't know
why I didn't know what I was gearing up
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And turns out what it was gearing up for
was to try to spread the message of this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant out to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it just, it came my, all of my life
loves being funny, making content and
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with these plants that we love.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just a match made in heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as I started in it,
that, I mean, I've been obsessed ever
[SPEAKER_01]: since it's pretty much been my last two
and a half years.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I do is just think plants,
lighting, YouTube, engagement,
[SPEAKER_01]: community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant provides and man,
it's provided a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just say you have done an
incredible job over at the Duke grow show,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping produce their shows, huge,
huge increase in quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like viewership has increased
significantly since the old producer to
[SPEAKER_00]: the new producer, you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the changes that you're doing
have been, it seemed to be very positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a great job over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had our channel at the 88,000
subscribers and was deleted by YouTube for
[SPEAKER_01]: linking out to seeds, which are,
you know, a hundred percent fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was a big kick in the teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really re-motivated me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have just joined the team and been
like, all right, you know, what,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you guys want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when that happened, it's like,
well, do we quit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this is a conversation that
was had in a meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we stop doing this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, we can't, you know,
I just threw coincidentally, one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that brought me to Colorado was
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had grown for a while,
but I, as, as I told to grow it before we
[SPEAKER_01]: started, I was like, I killed more plants
than I probably grew in my early,
[SPEAKER_01]: early days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew it was going to pay the rent
when I got to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm dyslexic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a huge reader.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd be on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be on your roll it up, your IC mag,
you know, but how much can you really
[SPEAKER_01]: clean from that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this new thing called podcasting had
like came out in 2014, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not in 2014, but really gained popularity
in the 2013, 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got into the Adam Dunn show and a
show called John Doe radio and this little
[SPEAKER_01]: fledgling group called the Dude Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd been a fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I might be one of their first fans,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I still started listening on episode
13 and we just recorded episode 1,718 the
[SPEAKER_01]: other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So man, shout out to those guys for going
through the adversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get the, they get the, the OG points
for, they did it before it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible contributions there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say your growth style
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you grow indoors or outdoors or in
soil, cocoa, hydro, organic, synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been an indoor guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it started as like, you know,
my friend's older brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the guy that introduced me to like
consuming and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a family I've known since
I was two next door neighbors,
[SPEAKER_01]: best friends with the youngest brother,
friends with all the older brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I was a de facto sibling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he would go out of town,
I would get tapped.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, I'm going to Hawaii for two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I'm going to teach you how to take
care of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and pretty much all I remember
from that day, he would just yell at me
[SPEAKER_01]: more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put your cow mag on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's all, that's all I
remember from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so I was like, well,
when I get here, I need to really get my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my game dialed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I started educating myself,
it became quite clear that the easiest,
[SPEAKER_01]: most effective way for indoor cultivation,
for at least how I was going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: performing it was to be to into cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I messed around Pete for a while and you
know, having a day job, I'd be out in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I couldn't get home in time
and I'd get lazy in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't exactly like the thing that
was the most important to me when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: living in Iowa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just kind of like, how do you get
good product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, you can meet all the
people in the world and pay out the notes
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can get yourself some, some
genetics and just go that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I started taking this
seriously, I was like, I became a Scotty
[SPEAKER_01]: real disciple.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was always a, a growing cocoa sort of
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, all right, let me start
growing cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Found great results immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I found is that when I did it
right, when I used the nutrient program,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way it was designed and gave the
plants what they needed in the time they
[SPEAKER_01]: needed, all of a sudden I found I don't
even need cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was one of my early insights of like,
uh-oh, the people that taught me might not
[SPEAKER_01]: know as much as I thought they knew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that hole in my knowledge base,
I'm a, I'm a real like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: aggressive learner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I'm a, I used to be a professional
poker player.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a very, very high level guitar player.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stand a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a 3d animator with blender,
3d animation software.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I just have to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I have a hole in my knowledge,
I get real crazy about it and I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: learn everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, that's what's kind of cued me
onto my journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what became so perfect about
getting in the media game is that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly, I am not in this just for a
paycheck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally, I could, you know,
the paycheck's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay your rent with the rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're just able to pay our rent
through the Patreon supporters and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, I just, I really love a
good puzzle and I think growing is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the funner puzzles that I've came across.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, Coco indoor, uh, went from HPS to
led.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole conversation that,
you know, that's what kind of got us going
[SPEAKER_01]: on this topic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Immediately, uh, as far as lighting and
yeah, so I, I, I've learned a lot in the
[SPEAKER_01]: last little bit and it just keeps changing
month to month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like you're real passionate about
this community and you're real driven to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more and improve and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's awesome to see hacking nerds,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things I want to ask right
off the bat, we have a lot of folks who
[SPEAKER_00]: are shopping for grow lights, right here
in 2025, what should grows look for when
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing a grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the, the question is,
uh, is right off the bat is, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it's kind of like, it's the,
the map, you know, where are you trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: go is where you're going to try to get,
you know, so like, let's say you're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: tent and, uh, you're inside your bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right off the bat, we've kind of
nixed HPS out of the picture, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to be able to grow with
high intensity lighting in a, in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: tent atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, is you have to air cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the things that's really,
uh, got me educated on this, like even 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago is, you know, growing in a pre
led environment where you're stacking
[SPEAKER_01]: lights together in a small room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all had to be vented hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd run air through the hood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd remove all that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the byproduct of that is you were
cooling the bulb.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so color temperature, like you'd have
like a more orange, uh, uh, number,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for the HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that number is that's an
actual temperature color is temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're lowering the
temperature of the bulb to its actual spec
[SPEAKER_01]: operating thing, you're losing a lot of
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started learning, like,
why is it my friends that like have like
[SPEAKER_01]: Gavita strapped to their ceiling and their
giant basement are getting what,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the same genetic, we'd all share
genetics back then it was, it was tougher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there wasn't all the seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the, the, the, the genetic banks
were over in Europe and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'd be ordering off the back of
magazines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was sea monkeys or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it wasn't, it wasn't a lot of
trust as far as like the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really relying on the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all shared genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd find things that we liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the forum cut of the, of the
cookies, like back, back, back in the day
[SPEAKER_01]: when it first came out and I'm noticing
these guys are getting way better results
[SPEAKER_01]: than I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that was different is I
was venting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then turns out as I started educating
myself, sure enough, I was losing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're losing a lot of power that's
supposed to be hitting those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're choosing, I would say,
uh, there's a lot of controversy
[SPEAKER_01]: controversy right now about HPS versus
led.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's very,
very interesting is genetic expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with the jug guys, the jug dealers
over at new millennium nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, Jaron always likes to say,
a phenotype is genotype times environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you and I have the same cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the same genetic profile,
but then you put it outside and I put it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a tent and they're going to express
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I always wondered where did all the
things that I loved in the two thousands,
[SPEAKER_01]: where did they go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still, I still get the, the name some
hell here's the strain you want and they
[SPEAKER_01]: give it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got the name and it looks kind of
like it, but it didn't taste the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't smell the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't, didn't quite look the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it, was it genetic drift?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, was it all the clothes are being
abused or people lying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it not the thing that I did?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as I started meeting more people,
more trustworthy guys that are OGs in the
[SPEAKER_01]: game, I started getting the real stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd get the real cuts from the real
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still didn't express.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I started digging in another hole
in knowledge and I realized, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's because they're not grown under
vented hoods with GH nutrients packed
[SPEAKER_01]: together in a tiny room, VPD out of
control, like even bad growing conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a phenotypic expression that
you enjoy, the only way you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it is through an quote unquote,
an inferior growing process, because what
[SPEAKER_01]: plants were selected under is what they
will thrive under, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not running things like if you get a
genetic and you just take clone from clone
[SPEAKER_01]: to clone, it will acclimate to your
environment, but it will never,
[SPEAKER_01]: its code is locked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you take something and you breed
it, like if you back cross something and
[SPEAKER_01]: you self it and you self it against itself
and you, the genetic remains the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: it shuffles the deck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always remember that family that I
grew up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, I was friends with the old,
the middle, the youngest brother.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the oldest brother, he was like a
genetic copy of the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: The middle brother was like a genetic copy
of the dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the youngest brother was like a direct
split.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started understanding like,
Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was dealing with plants,
I started getting, okay, recessive genes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like some of the grandparents come
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the mom comes in different eye
color, different skin tone, different hair
[SPEAKER_01]: color.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take the twin brothers and
you raise them in different places and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to act completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Twins are raised in the same room,
finished each other's sentences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet twins raised across the country can
have surprisingly different lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started coming together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this comes back to lighting,
where one of the biggest things that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do to change your environment is the
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you chose an HPS versus LED,
one of the things that really makes LED
[SPEAKER_01]: superior to HPS is that you don't need the
cooling.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a watt is a watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I have a thousand watt LED and I
have a thousand watt HPS, technically
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking, more light is the same exact
heat, but the LEDs produce more light for
[SPEAKER_01]: that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your output is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not that LEDs are cooler or
there's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a watt of heat equals X amount of BTUs
and you're going to get what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out that when you measure things
like leaf surface temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go in there with a little
thermometer gun and you point at the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to run your room slightly higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hotter with LED because
there isn't that infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's almost no infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see those red diodes in an LED,
that's them trying to stick some red in
[SPEAKER_01]: there because they don't come with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas HPS, high pressure sodium just
kicks out the IR.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you could feel the heat coming
off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why if you go to a restaurant,
you'll see the IR heaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have something that isn't glowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not red.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not hot to like visually hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no color coming off it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet you're getting blasted with this heat
that's coming off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a pure IR lamp that's
hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that that wouldn't have a,
you know, we'll just, I'll raise the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is kind of interesting is that's
the leaf surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually affects like the biotic
structure of what's going on, like heat
[SPEAKER_01]: stresses and things, even though there's
micro boundary layers that your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: creates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we like a lot of airflow and
get them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it breaks those micro boundary layers
across because it's just got this micro
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of insulation, we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you want to knock that all off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just raising the temperature of
your room doesn't necessarily get the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant leaf surface temperature all that
much higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you're bombarded with that IR,
it gets it way higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, so even the things that we
kind of consider not valuable in growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it is affecting the metabolism of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I'm not getting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That diesel expression, I want that 2003
diesel, you know, like lifestyle Rob and
[SPEAKER_01]: I, when we were hanging out in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're just the right amount
of boomer millennial that we remember that
[SPEAKER_01]: 2003 diesel, baby, where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: It still exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to grow it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to 2025 standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like these days, particularly in
the homegrown market that I feel like a
[SPEAKER_00]: majority of people are going with LEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: D versus the HID, you know, HID that
whether it be HPS or MH or even CMH falls
[SPEAKER_00]: into the HID category, high intensity
discharge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, as far as what to look for when
purchasing a grow light, I think first
[SPEAKER_00]: thing right off the bat is coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: What area are you trying to cover?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for a two foot by four
foot coverage area, well, you can filter
[SPEAKER_00]: it down by there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can kind of get into the
granular details of what's the power
[SPEAKER_00]: output.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the light spectrum look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could even look at like the
diodes, drivers, people get really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really deep into what's the BTU,
the heat output.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of different things that
people can look at when they're shopping
[SPEAKER_00]: for an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to narrow it down to spectrum here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of grow light listings that
have full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: They advertise full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it safe to say that it's sufficient for
growing medicinal plants from seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest if it's labeled as full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, one of the things that we'll like to
talk about, I work with a company with jug
[SPEAKER_01]: dealers, DLI Dutch lighting innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of their sayings is like,
you can get any crappy Chinese light off
[SPEAKER_01]: of Amazon and run it for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that thing will be banging out pretty
decent harvest, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you get to your third run,
your fourth run, your fifth run,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of a sudden there's degradation and
the light output starts dropping and the
[SPEAKER_01]: power input doesn't drop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as your efficiency starts, LEDs,
cheaper LEDs that you get, they will be
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said, the watt per output.
[SPEAKER_01]: The output is higher than, than an HID
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after year two, you go measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can drop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get down to half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're losing, you can lose three
quarters efficiency if you don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the main things is the old
saying buy once, cry once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get one of the trustworthy companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I personally, I have two tents
that I grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: One has the DL Dutch lighting innovation
LED in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other has got an HLG horticultural
lighting group LED in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're both high quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both have them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I almost couldn't tell the
difference between the two as like output.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I use one for vegging mainly and
the other for the flower, but it's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also be considered as a power of your
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another reason that LED is so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most HID lights are 240.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to, you have to plug it
into that dryer outlet or get a special
[SPEAKER_01]: switcher box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then goes into a ballast that then goes
into the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's so much production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you can just get a decent LED
light, plug it into the wall of your
[SPEAKER_01]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's kind of like the reason that
there's a Renaissance in the game right
[SPEAKER_01]: now is because all of a sudden,
you know, there is a time for carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: filters didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people would spray gels and
cologne and crap all over their rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause how do we get rid of this smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so between carbon filtration,
then the upgrade in the tent technology,
[SPEAKER_01]: then the upgrade in the lights,
all of a sudden, literally everybody for
[SPEAKER_01]: under a thousand dollars, you can get a
perfect setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grow amazing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all of that sunk cost situation,
you will pay yourself back.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you're getting your, your
material, you're putting in your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you're getting that, you're
paying for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to, it mounts up faster
than you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you write down $20 here, $50 here,
you're going to hit that thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably spend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you get good equipment,
it's going to last for years and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to 20X your initial sunk cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buy once, cry once, get one of the
reputable companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Samsung just went out of business,
everything or not out of business,
[SPEAKER_01]: but out of the led game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're one of the big breakthroughs
that gave us this full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that subject, I was always a CRI
guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is color rendering index,
the sun being 100, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to match our lights
against the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And HPS was very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 50 CRI at best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned metal halide or not a metal
halide, but ceramic metal halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I ended up going with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing under a double ended 315.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was running 630s as a double,
double balled hoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CRI jumped from like 50 up to 80.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when these led lights came out,
well, God, they're like 95.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this must be the answer to all my
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it is and it isn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing, once again,
that selection problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing modern genetics and a
lot of people are growing the modern
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and there's no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love people hate on the candy strains,
the fruit strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, you know, I love it's all a place
in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I love the gassy stuff, the fuely
stuff, the rank nasty stuff, but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: place for that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so these grow lights are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They mimic the sun almost exactly,
but not perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially once again, like humans are
a great analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are grown in this Saharan
plains, you know, and they're bombarded
[SPEAKER_01]: with sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have darker skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people were raised in the foggy
London town and they have light skin so
[SPEAKER_01]: they can try to pull up more stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put me in the Sahara desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to get much work done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to work the field,
you know, I'm not going to get anything
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet you put me in a dark basement,
which is the ambient light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know exactly what to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your plans.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were bred to be under HBS,
that's where they want to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll do fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you force me, like you put,
you kidnapped me and put me into mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be sunburned as hell and I'm going to
feel like hell, but I will get the work
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with your plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will do what you need it to do,
but it's not going to do the thing that it
[SPEAKER_01]: did back in the 90s, 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're growing that modern stuff,
yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally picture perfect,
match made in heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the LEDs for the ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does make them a lot easier to
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a full spectrum is sufficient for
growing from seed to harvest, how about
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies that have specialized light
spectrum that they advertise?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the spectrum that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it actually translate to better
results or is it mostly marketing
[SPEAKER_00]: gimmicks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, company to company, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them it's just marketing gimmicks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that gets me about it is that
the thing that the trend that's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: amongst like, you know, I am very,
we have a check your privilege sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: saying around my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hang out with some of the best growers
with the best genetics, the best
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, all the best knowledge,
and I get to watch them from afar.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's popped up is
mixed spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a ton of people like in
commercial facilities, they're doing these
[SPEAKER_01]: checker boards where they're putting an
HPS light in between four LEDs and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll just be checker boarded all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the science is way not
caught up to the bro science, the
[SPEAKER_01]: anecdotal data, the anic data,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear a lot of people, I see a lot
of people and I'm watching people who's
[SPEAKER_01]: putting food for their children on the
table based on these results.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're swearing, hey man,
I'm getting better results with these
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Confuses me because if we have a full
spectrum LED light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's covering all the bases that the
HPS is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's little gaps in the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you looked at spectrograph,
it's not just like a flat sine wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like, here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a squirrely-durley sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And different compounds are generated by
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, like I mentioned with the
infrared, I would have thought as I
[SPEAKER_01]: educated myself, there was nothing to do
with IR in there, but it turns out there
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden I'm like, all right,
well, I don't have all the science and
[SPEAKER_01]: there is not science.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only science that's coming out is done
by the lighting companies themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take that with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have all the homies who feed
themselves and their children based on
[SPEAKER_01]: these numbers, and they're saying that
these mixing of spectrums is having a
[SPEAKER_01]: result, not just on quantity, but also on
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as we move forward,
that's what we're all really trying to hit
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The days of yield being number one,
I think those are fairly over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think quality is king these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you on that one,
it seems, except for the commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have quite a few people that are
working in commercial facilities and they
[SPEAKER_00]: still have a hammer coming down on them,
trying to get more yield from the uppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, quality, but there are
still some folks that have to strive for
[SPEAKER_00]: yield because their business relies on it,
I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a little bit deeper into
far-red light, which is something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: had mentioned a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about far-red light,
specifically between 700 and 750
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it do to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, is it worth supplementing
far-red light or do most grow lights have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough far-red that it's not worth
supplementing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is something I've been hearing
about for 10 years, but once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: still is ever evolving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny, we recorded an episode of the
Jug Dealers podcast the other day and I
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to know, once again, I've been in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've watched certain people use far-red to
effective results for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm talking with these guys here,
Jaren and Gabe, two of my most respected
[SPEAKER_01]: grow brains in all the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they both look me in the eye and
they're like, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, well, I thought they were going
to be, yeah, of course, the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: initiation, that stuff works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, no, it doesn't do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exist in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, oh, so this goes deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those controversial things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the red and there's the UV we'll
get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that to be not since organic versus
synthetic have we had as much debate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the growing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as far as the far-red, some people
can be confused right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should probably clarify that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned the red earlier as the IR,
the infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when, as Gro mentioned,
the PAR, when you see a PAR chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's what does a plant see?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it like the visual spectrum of a
human, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see X-rays and gamma rays.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see microwaves and radio waves,
but we see visible light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same sort of thing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a visual spectrum that it can
see, but just the same way as X-rays sure
[SPEAKER_01]: as hell affect us, if we're bombarded with
them, same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things outside of the PAR range also
affect the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so infrared is outside of that PAR
range, way outside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's, like I said, that's why it's
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, it's outside of PAR,
yet it still does affect the metabolism of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also that's infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're discussing far-red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is slightly on the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just dipping over the side of the PAR
range, a little bit in, a little bit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does quite a bit of sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of negative stuff as well as
positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main things that I think as I
can speak is, there's not a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of science out there as far
as this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, it's a lot of the companies
and I trust a lot of the companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shane from Migro, I trust this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certain characters out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jair from the Dutch Lighting Innovations,
I trust him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when these guys say things,
I listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can start with the negative sort
of effects that the far-red will have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far-red is just like, if you can think
like the reason that X-rays are so
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful is they're a really small wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I want to make something like
jiggle fast, I got to put a lot of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so versus a radio wave, it's this
giant huge thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can wrap over your house and still get
a signal on the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if I shot an X-ray burst at your
house, it's going to hit the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too small of a wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can think of the far-red kind
of like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bigger thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can get past your canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get past your leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can get down lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a forest and you've got a
bunch of trees that are shading out a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, a little plant that's trying to
grow down there, our little favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: high-valued plants that we like to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we put that underneath a giant forest
canopy, it's not going to get any of that
[SPEAKER_01]: delicious par that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it is going to get is some of
that far-red because it can get through
[SPEAKER_01]: the canopy and it still hit it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that tells the plant is stretch,
babysit, stretch, you're not getting any
[SPEAKER_01]: of the yummy light that we need to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting all that red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means that there's light above
us, but we ain't getting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got to grow up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I've seen a lot
is people that will use their far-red
[SPEAKER_01]: lights all cycle is that they're getting a
lot of stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people like the stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an interesting thing at the Five
Eight Jug Dealers, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to say it's like, think of like a
bloom booster, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like an additive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to get you farther.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of like these UV, the far-red,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the additives that we're adding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some genetics need more cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some need less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some genetics, some cultivars,
as we're now calling them, or probably
[SPEAKER_01]: should have always been calling them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strains are for mushrooms and flues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivars are for plants, just to clear up
any.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still call it strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can still say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a snicker puss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't talk down to someone because they
say strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get it, cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these cultivars, they need
more than others.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you've got like these little
tiny squat plants that you want to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: up, maybe you have techniques for
increasing that internodal spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things, the reasons we don't
like stretching is because it takes no to
[SPEAKER_01]: no of those flower sites and increases it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get these giant top heavy
things that want to bend and break,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're having to give them more
silica, so that way they have a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more elasticity to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything just gets changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're one of these high-level
thinking growers, like my buddy from
[SPEAKER_01]: Three's Genetics, a JLS monster,
he's one of the best breeders in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, I like, I run my far-red
mid-cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like a little stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll grow this kernel chem that I love.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got some of it sitting over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, it's too squat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nodes are too together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I get bud mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have never thought, like,
okay, maybe this guy wants stretch because
[SPEAKER_01]: he's getting botrytis at the end of his
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, this loosens up some of those
tight flower sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was, okay, I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing I would have been
like, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could say, that's bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, stretching is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not if that's exactly what you want to
keep your plants that keep you happy and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, happy and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the positive side of it is the
flower initiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, my friends have legit been doing
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think of it just like I talked
about with how red are these big giant
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before our eyes can actually see the
sunrise, we're actually starting to get
[SPEAKER_01]: bombarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why it starts to heat up a little
bit before the sun even comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting hit with that IR.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, it's the biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cooking up our atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that far red is coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so even though the sun hasn't crested
the horizon yet, it's still throwing some
[SPEAKER_01]: of that far red that our eyes can't
necessarily even see, but the plants can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that tells them to wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same conversely, when the sun starts to go
down, it crosses the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all that visible light is blocked
by the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet some of that red is still so big,
just like the X-rays hitting your house
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the radio hitting your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hit the radio in a big city,
even though it's blocked, your plant sees,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, there's that outgoing red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time to go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have called this the flower
initiator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll run it for 15 minutes before your
lights turn on and 15 minutes after your
[SPEAKER_01]: lights turn on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tells them that it is fully time to
wake up and fully time to go to bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes your plants an hour to... So
once again, cultivar specific,
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants go to sleep very, very fast
and some others take forever, just like
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like life is like life.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so much like us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost spooky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it will tell them, wake up,
go to bed, and they go faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then so they're able to produce sugars
and oxens at night and interchange with
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots and the shoots, as we call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They both are doing different roles.
[SPEAKER_01]: One's creating oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: People always think that the plants,
well, they create CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did you know the roots create
oxygen?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why terrariums can exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew my mind when I started learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put a plant in a sealed bottle and
it will live because its roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing oxygen and the flowers are
producing CO2 and it can circulate through
[SPEAKER_01]: the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you start shortening those days
or not shortening your days, but getting
[SPEAKER_01]: them to go to sleep faster, you're
actually day after day in a 60 to 80 day
[SPEAKER_01]: flower cycle, you're actually pulling
several days off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are saying I'm pulling a week
off of my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the point I try to make with Jaren
and Gabe on the junk dealer show is where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like, no, it doesn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I think we're talking
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it does anything to increase
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not gonna get more oil and those
VOCs from this, but you're taking time off
[SPEAKER_01]: of your schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's more, I guess this could be lumped
into the yield category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause if you could jam another harvest in
your garden each year, even if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: losing a little bit of weight run to run,
you're gaining that weight back plus by
[SPEAKER_01]: jamming a whole extra harvest in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something we all can
get down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're definitely pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like that con that you
mentioned is really subjective,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually I had somebody on the podcast
pretty recently, Dave Baker, shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on there talking about auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that was pretty interesting
is he actually uses the far red for auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he wants that stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants that veg growth to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, he wants the biggest plant as he
possibly get in an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously we all know that it's limited on
his time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the timeframe for veg, it
automatically flips to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that veg timeframe is super,
super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's any stunt growth, you could
have a significantly smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he utilizes far red supplements far red
in order to get a bigger stretch on his
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers before they actually flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what learning looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: People go, people ask questions like,
how do you know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go, cause someone smart told me at
once and I listened auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause exactly like I talked about,
like getting bud rot and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually an outside outdoor sort of
thing, you know, but a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_01]: get it indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could totally see you get that,
that giant Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really top an auto flower the
way we would top a normal photo period
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get this giant Christmas tree cola
going up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could see totally increasing that
internodal length gives you more room for
[SPEAKER_01]: those buds to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tells them there's more space for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This makes sense to me.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say it's worth adding in like
for people to actually go out and buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to supplement or is it just kind of
like a plant additive where you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but it's kind of like an optional
thing and it'll take you a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: further, but it might not be worth it for
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can type into Google, Google image
search at some point after this podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone listening, just type a law of the
minimums chart or graphic, the law of the
[SPEAKER_01]: minimums, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you take a barrel, and it's all got
level sides, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fill the water up to that level of
the barrel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you take one plank of that barrel and
you hammer it down five inches,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the height of what that barrel can
contain is now its lowest point,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water is going to flow out that hole
until it reaches to that equilibrium point
[SPEAKER_01]: of that lowest plank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's your new water level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pull that plank up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can fill it all the way back up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's Lee Bigg's law of the
minimums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can never remember exactly the fella's
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned from college educated people yet
was not college educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a hard time retaining some of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a knowledge fire hose out there these
days, Gro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to maintain all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, look up law of the minimums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say for sure, we will say this
even about something as pedantic as CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about it until everything else
is dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not hitting your DLI,
your preferred PPF D, you're not even
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to, like you're going to
get, that's another thing about giving it
[SPEAKER_01]: more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this weird cause and effect loop,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't worry about having CO2 if you don't
have enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then don't worry about putting more
light in if you don't have CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a weird, all apes or monkeys or
all monkeys are apes, but not all apes or
[SPEAKER_01]: monkeys sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like depending on what you're doing is,
so I would say for sure, just a short
[SPEAKER_01]: answer to the question is yeah,
it should be one of the last things you're
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have your room dialed in and
you're like, I don't know how I could
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly make it any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, now we're talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the person that should be kind of
thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a new grower, you're buying
your first tent and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: should I buy some far red?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your light will contain enough to be
perfectly adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about ultraviolet light,
UV light, 100 to 400 nanometers?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that do to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is that worth supplementing or do most
grow lights have UV in the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: That supplementation isn't really
necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that puts fear in my chest
because all of a sudden growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a man of science, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I study quantum mechanics for fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the particle zoo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to talk about how time dilation
works with muons life cycle being shorter
[SPEAKER_01]: than they can get from the earth to the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet they crash in with the earth every
single millisecond forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll talk that for you forever,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love, love, love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questioning science is part of science,
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we live in the most divisive times
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you say things like, ah,
you can't believe the science,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get put in a category, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of like, you're a political person.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You voted for this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sorts of crap gets brought up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, with a big asterisk go into this
next subject is that once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not many people doing science on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that are doing the science
are scientists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not like consumers, the way we are
there where they're not looking at it from
[SPEAKER_01]: the perspective that we're looking at it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just what this is, we, we totally
planted a fertile bed of seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's knowledge base that now we can
catch up to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because expression, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different plants, different cultivars,
different genetic profiles, recessive,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different things are affected by
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I'm a scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to do things one at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't test multiple variables
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get a baseline, agree with my
peer group that this is the baseline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I want to change something,
I change one variable and then I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get more results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll change something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start doing these one-to-one tests
over and over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a full data set that's full and
useful starts to emerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we only have a handful of guys,
you know, and one of the ones that gets
[SPEAKER_01]: thrown in my personal face every single
day of talking about this would be our
[SPEAKER_01]: esteemed member of this community,
Bruce Bugsby.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Bruce Bugsby very, very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: This guy is a genius, but the man is a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when he talks, he talks about things
like, so I'll get, I'm burying the lead
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: A guy like Bruce Bugsby says, UV does not
affect plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not creating more oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not creating more cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not creating more flavor molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I happen to live in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for the Dutch lighting innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work with these guys very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're part of my friend's friends and
they sell a purpose made UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a HID.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not HPS necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's inspired by it, but it's a UV
just light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a burning ball of gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just like the sun putting off all
that UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's growing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the only full spectrum UV
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, there's UVA, there's UVB and
there's UVC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can think of A is just ambient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Scotty reel on the dew grows like say
B stands for burn and C stands for cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to, it hurts you.
[SPEAKER_01]: UVC is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in our earth's atmosphere, thankfully,
since UVC is so dangerous for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: it filters out almost all of the UVC,
but we still get a lot of the UVB and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the UVA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they come out with a light that
directly mimics that it's expense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, costs money and I'm
watching people all over put it in and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my friend Terpacana Kyle, he's one of
the best growers I've ever met.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this guy for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is literally the smartest man as far as
like hands on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves talk and grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and he's a, he, it's just the
way that a scientist would only do one
[SPEAKER_01]: variable at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had his, his room dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else can I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's looking for terpene production.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls his company Terpacana and it's
all about those terps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's like, let me try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just, he's instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's like, dude, after three runs,
I mean, I'm getting this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, anecdotal, he's like,
I'm getting like eight to 10% more
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes as you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll do a BHO runs of the, of the oils
and it fractionates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll get like a crystalline
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get like a, and it's, it's
different land at the very, very tippy top
[SPEAKER_01]: is just pure terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can scoop those off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can weigh them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually do data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, man, I'm getting 10% more
terps off of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that UV will do
once again, so that's why I preface with
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's controversy here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got groups of people in the academic
community saying that it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got groups of people in the hands-on
practitioners and they're saying it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just the, that's why I press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a man of science, but in the aspect of
UV, I'm choosing because the science
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't, I believe the science isn't in yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data that we have is pointing at a
suggestion but I don't take that at face
[SPEAKER_01]: value yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in 2030, if that's still,
if there's all these tests are going and
[SPEAKER_01]: all, there's more and more and more
bugbees of the world all confirming this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go, okay, maybe my friends are full
of crap and they got that 10%,
[SPEAKER_01]: not full of crap, but they did get that
increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's some other variable that
they weren't aware of, but as it stands
[SPEAKER_01]: now, I believe that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but one consequence is if you are a
yield person, it reduces biomass,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it increases the, we think of the
trikes and everything, all that is all the
[SPEAKER_01]: oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sunscreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It puts it on there as a protective layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't want things landing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't want bombarded by all that UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we like positive stressors in our
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big, some people do the low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a high stress trainer, boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm breaking necks in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like, you'd see like old,
fucking John Claude Van Damme,
[SPEAKER_01]: movies and they're punching gravel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're like, ah, and they're
creating micro fractures in their hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when those micro fractures fill in
with all the calcium and things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: take, you're stronger and beefier and you
got these giant thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've all seen, if you break a
plant, it gets this giant knuckle on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my buddy, Jay Maestro, he goes,
well, to hell with knuckles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want my whole plant to be a knuckle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I break, I'm popping everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants just look dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people I grow with are just like,
what have you done?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've killed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 hours later, it's right back to
praying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to create positive
stressors and UV, I believe is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most positive stressors you can get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can't work under this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is bad for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in these commercial facilities that do
have these, they run them about three
[SPEAKER_01]: hours a day and people can't be under
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are quite dangerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't play games with UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another thing about UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that you talked about shady marketing
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's where the shadiest marketing
practices come out, is the different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best UV through glass, from a bulb,
these high pressure bulbs, the UV,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Dutch lighting UV bulbs, that's the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hands down, it's the only product that's
like that on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, you get the bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have these bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bars work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bars are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get good UVA out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a little bit of UVB,
no C obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't want too much C anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I also like the bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, micro, no relation to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like the guys, they educate the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give it out for free and say,
if you like what we give you, come try our
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have friends that have tried it
and had good results so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we get to the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a no-go.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs cannot maintain UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about if you put a red chair out
in the sun, bright red chair, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Big, you got this lawn chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cherry ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you put it out there for a couple
summers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like light pink after a couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all that UV light is breaking it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It attacks plastics and it just degrades
them quite quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, your LEDs are essentially made of
these different plastic polymers and such,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally as you're running UV through
these things, they are degrading them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just like I talked about spectral
degradation of cheaper LEDs, there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: LED on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally breaking itself from the
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you'll get a couple of weeks of
great production out of some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: diode based UV systems, but they're going
to break themselves pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're just running heat in your
garden to a light that is producing near
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say go with the full spectrum
glass, then the bars, avoid the LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few times here in this podcast,
I want to get deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of beginners on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not even know what DLI is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what is DLI and what do
you aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had kept referencing DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a clever company name, Dutch Lighting
Innovations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what we're referencing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of took that as like their cute
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it actually means as far as like
botanical means is daily light integral.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much light can a plant absorb in a
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of your plant as a bucket and
photons like raindrops.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much can it actually hold?
[SPEAKER_01]: And once a bucket's full, it's full.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the DLI of your plant is how much
of those raindrops of energy can it hold
[SPEAKER_01]: per day?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does it need to be called a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one of the things that really got
me like one of those knowledge gaps that's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, I got to do some homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing 10 years before I
learned we call it a photo period,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What we should really call it is like an
anti-photo period or lack of photo period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing that actually dictates
your photo cycle is the nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: This blew my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scotty and I, dude grows, you know,
we'll enjoy our favorite compounds late at
[SPEAKER_01]: night and we'll have discussions all about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all we ever talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started thinking about this insane
concept, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We play God with our plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We, we give them, we are, we let there be
light, we say, and so there is light that
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, we, we have that level of
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what a 24 hour day is,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about if you had a cultivar,
especially that was not hungry for light
[SPEAKER_01]: and you hit its DLI super early,
what necessarily, cause you're the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the photo period is the 12 hours of
dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what created it's a flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can't interrupt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to interrupt that all that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll create a lot of stressors in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people I know like our friends in
Southern Colorado down there will,
[SPEAKER_01]: they recommend certain like, you know,
do a 16 eight sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that creates controversy works for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they like that positive
stressors, you know, maybe they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to stress their plants in a manner there,
but just to keep it, we want our genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want them self in doing any sort
of weirdness, throwing manners or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to make sure we hold that 12
hours of darkness, but there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: special about that 12 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: All we need is to hit our DLI.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hypothetically speaking, Mr. Groat,
what if we had a plant that had a low DLI,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got a high intensity light or led
that that's really kicking those photons
[SPEAKER_01]: down and we hit our DLI in eight hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Couldn't we theoretically just cut,
cut, cut this show, give them the 12
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got a 20 hour day,
a 20 hour day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's that going to do for,
if we're talking about flower initiators
[SPEAKER_01]: sneaking in an extra harvest, cause you
sneak in another harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you, could you be doing six or seven
runs a year?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, my head starts going
crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started looking into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these like gas lamp techniques
where they like, we'll do things like give
[SPEAKER_01]: veg plants an hour, like mid cycle,
all this crazy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend going through the old forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much of this is bro science,
but so much of it still works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, something, one of the things
that blows my mind about science is how
[SPEAKER_01]: much the old boys were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were, you were right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how you knew that,
but you were actually right about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a lot of old tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here we are thinking like, I thought
Scotty was like, no, there's been these
[SPEAKER_01]: different light schedules sort of things
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd never heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A 20 hour day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unheard of.
[SPEAKER_01]: A nine, a nine day week.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden it became like,
the, the main thing I was thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: is like, man, is there any place that
documents DLI of cultivars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like see how like bait were so infantile
and our knowledge of these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: like these plants, like there is so much
room to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pun intended as growers, like a holy
crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is there any, anyone leave it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave a comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a great time right in this video,
right below.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have any experience with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is, I'm going to check back
to comments.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like Andrew who,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those things that isn't talked
about as much as it should be in my
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just go after the par.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much par and PPFD are you giving your
plants right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But having the light cycle, knowing how
much, how long your lights are on and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much par you're giving, running those
numbers to a DLI calculator, which you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find online just by doing a Google search
and then figure out how much DLI your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants are actually getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is that too much or is it not
enough?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, for medicinal plants around
40, I think is safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard upwards of 60 DLI.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically, do you have a
specific number that you kind of aim for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for DLI or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I unfortunately had a little
relationship ending over COVID,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're being locked down
together for a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got on each other's nerves a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had my mom pass away and all sorts of
drama went on in that couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I went from growing in amazing grow
rooms, my whole, I'd never grown in a tent
[SPEAKER_01]: my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been growing 10 years, never gonna,
I always had grow rooms, giant two car
[SPEAKER_01]: garages, fully sealed, you know,
nothing gets in, nothing gets out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the glory days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just started growing in tents
this last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just moved to my new apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in the last like two years,
while I've been increasing all of my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, my anic data has not been
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had my friends or my hands in
the dirt doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get all the different reports from my
friends, like you telling me like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, okay, these are the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way my brain works is like,
since I don't, you know, I'm not in there
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know, the photon app or all
these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That come out checking out what the PPFD
and everything is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have my personal recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have numbers for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm a man of science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not ever want to come on a big
platform like this and spew anything
[SPEAKER_01]: that's out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will defend UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't give you a DLA based on my
personal experience, cause I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can burn up your plants a little bit,
you know, you can have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make sure that's where the CO2
comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are going to increase that DLA and
especially that PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe PPFD is photosynthetic
photon flux density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say you go from stoner to quantum
mechanics in four moves in this game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go, will you do it like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because a radiation of light goes
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, because of as different photons
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because quantum mechanics, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate your honesty there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not everybody knows everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, this hour has flown by.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are coming up towards the end here and
we just scratched the surface when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much more that can come with
this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can do a part two in the future
where you can go even further on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell, listen to how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the number one thing I'd say is my
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm at Josh Granbo, J-O-S-H-G-R-A-M-B-O
and Granbo was his name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Rambo, but I'm a G, you know,
one of those sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I'm a standup comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got taken off of the road to I'm an
entertainer, not just standup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a, I actually have a themed band
coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Possession with intent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a metal band.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking with ICANN THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a rapper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been trying to get him to come on,
Matt, let's start a band, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so like I got a lot of dogs in
the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of the YouTube stuff, you know,
it, it takes care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to tell you our community
that we share in this growing community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is hands down the best commute.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in many different fields doing
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I cut my teeth on my way to find this,
I worked for a sleep education company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just taught you how to sleep better and
feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get flamed every day by haters and
nonsense and crazy spammers and all sorts
[SPEAKER_01]: of weirdness.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't believe how good this community of
growing is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you guys, I mean, you'll see in the
comments, people are forced.
[SPEAKER_01]: This video has got 400 people watching it
and only 50 likes get in there and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like, Whoa, chats like hurt,
you know, hurting everyone to like and
[SPEAKER_01]: share and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, so yeah, the community that takes
care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to help me go follow me on
Instagram helps me get, um, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: more gigs as far as comedy helps my reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you own a bar, a Tavern, you want me to
come, you want me to come as a grandma,
[SPEAKER_01]: the comedian, grandma, the grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will show up.
[SPEAKER_01]: In force with my funny friends,
my knowledgeable friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do your events.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh, all the jug dealers guys were
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to spandibus this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here in the next few weeks,
we're going to be heading over to Spain
[SPEAKER_01]: for spandibus hanging out with Adam Dunn
and Jaren and all the guys over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be super stoked for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested, uh, about all
this knowledge and weirdness, go follow me
[SPEAKER_01]: over there on Instagram at Josh Granville.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing that supports me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, just keep growing the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This community too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally is just so incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've was in the other communities before,
and this is like no other, the
[SPEAKER_00]: friendliness is unmatched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Granbo's
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below so you can easily get to it
and give him a follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also want to give a shout out to the folks
supporting on Patreon, patreon.com slash
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your support is greatly appreciated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that are being scrolled on the
screen right now are in the producer tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Granbo, thanks so much for coming
onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that lighting is one of those things
where I really enjoy talking about and
[SPEAKER_00]: listening to the new information that's
out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you for your time and I hope you
enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love it so much, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my goal and I feel achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grow on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
