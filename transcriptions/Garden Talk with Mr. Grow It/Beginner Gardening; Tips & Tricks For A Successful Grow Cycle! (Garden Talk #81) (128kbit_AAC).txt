[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing you want to do as a new grower
is you want to eliminate as many places
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can go wrong as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, take those variables out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't work hard to throw things in that
can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we just think more is better,
you know, more light, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: more nutrients, more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to give me more plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until you realize that's really not
the truth, just took it and split it right
[SPEAKER_02]: down the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we duct tape it all up, put a tomato
cage around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant was the biggest yielding
plant that we ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever it was, it just kicked it into
like some kind of super mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't chase a VPD number, a pH number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants will tell you what you need to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: More is not better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, sometimes the more you do,
the less you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Kronix Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 15 months and
has experience growing in soil as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: He likes to keep it simple and he talks
about what he does at his garden in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode includes a lot of good advice
for beginner gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening, all plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Vivo Sun for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivo Sun has been one of the top
manufacturers of horticulture equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As some of you have seen in my grow
videos, I have grown successfully using
[SPEAKER_00]: Negrotents, their inline fans,
LED grow lights, HID grow lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: and numerous accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivo Sun continues to create really
interesting technology that makes home
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their website at vivosun.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will provide a link in the YouTube
description section.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their clip-on oscillating fan is now
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their 6-inch version for
over 6 months now, and I absolutely love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to clip on the side of my grow
tent, and it has 10 different speeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it easy to control air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also have non-oscillating versions
of these clip-on fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fans are currently in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they sell out of the fans,
which I expect them to often, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-order them for the next release.

buying off Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Ventana Plant Science for
sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started using their bottle of Flava in
my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flava can be added to any nutrient lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Studies have shown an increased yield of
14% and also increased terpenes from 1.1
[SPEAKER_00]: to 2.4%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flava is an all-natural polymer that holds
nutrients in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also prevents precipitants of nutrients
and increases nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flava is available on growershouse.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll provide a link in the description
section below.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Chronics Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for having me on, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to go through a ton of
tips for beginner gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many people out there who are
starting their first garden, especially as
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization sweeps across the world here.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I want to go back to the
basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to scare off any
intermediate or advanced growers because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's going to be some
takeaways for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if it's just a reminder to keep
it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I may not look it, but I'm 55 years
old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have three grandchildren.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rescue animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of parrots, some cats and a
dog.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first introduction to growing medicinal
plants came when I started helping a
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor with an outdoor grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty much just a helper,
especially at the end when you had to do
[SPEAKER_02]: all the trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I met a girl and we bought a
house and we moved away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a skill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't really be doing that out in the
backyard where I live now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, it's a big open area.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of traffic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, we just bought a house.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't want to take any chances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of a sudden legalization
just, bam, it was here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a long talk with the girlfriend to
try to get her out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said, it'll just be a small little
thing and don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I went on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_02]: Started watching all the videos and 15
months later, here I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had three, I call the first one
successful because I finished,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I've had three grows in 15 months and
I'm about to finish my fourth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm getting a perpetual.
[SPEAKER_02]: My perpetual is just about set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm in a really good spot and that's
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a YouTube channel as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took the leap.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mainly did it in the beginning just to
kind of record my progress.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to look back and see where you
started at and just have a little fun,
[SPEAKER_02]: see what could happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hooked up with the folks from ILGM and
they took an interest in my channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: They helped me get over that 1,000 sub
hump with a couple giveaways and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that led to Spider Farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've been really good to me and
having a channel really helps in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're kind of doing a favor for a company
by showing their product and in return,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as you find decent companies to
work for and it works out good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as always, I'll definitely have a link
to Chronic Grow's channel down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's your overall style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, are you indoors mostly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an indoor in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did try the Fox farm a pretty dozen grow
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's a little more organic,
but it was just so many bottles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was really hard for me to really
understand when I was feeding at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of went back on that,
went back to the general hydroponics that
[SPEAKER_02]: I started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so much easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's going in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard to mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you mostly doing,
are you doing auto flowers or photo
[SPEAKER_00]: periods or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did when I, I'll tell you how I learned
to keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my first grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I went on YouTube, I'm watching
all these videos and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the choices I made, I started off
with DWC.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had auto flowers and photo periods in
the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had HPS lighting in a tap over the,
over the buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can imagine, it was a struggle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, my water's getting too
hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to do, you know, I had to wrap
the buckets and cover them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, keep the temperature down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was, you had to monitor the pH all
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the plants, they grew so fast
that at the end I ended up having to
[SPEAKER_02]: switch my hood because they just grew
right up into the hood to the top of the
[SPEAKER_02]: four by four tiny even though I had the
hood all the way as far as it could go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just hanging by the little clips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I finished, you know, it, you know,
I got quite a lot of, a lot of product out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it, but you know, the, the can,
the light on my pantry is so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything below that, you know,
it's, it's pretty much, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, edible quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, you know, it's just larpy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just expected it to be better having
seen what it looks like outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just, it just, you know, I knew I bit
off more than I can chew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, okay, I got to get back to the
basics.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I got to figure out what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I wanted perpetual right from
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew that, you know, I started small
with one tap, but my goal was,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, if this works out, then I'm going to
go get another tap for veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to, you know, try to keep
this at least get a two light rotation
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, I started learning,
you know, about overwatering too much
[SPEAKER_02]: light, too many nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once I, I learned that I didn't really
have to, have to do that much with soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil seemed like the way to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was just so the, the very
first one with the DWC just took up so
[SPEAKER_02]: much of my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was down there, you have to
check, you know, that pH is so important
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're in those, that kind of system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil, it's not so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to, you got a lot wider range,
you know, that you can play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, you know, it's expanded and,
you know, I got a three light rotation
[SPEAKER_02]: going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's every eight or 10 weeks,
I'm harvesting the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DWC, I mean, you mentioned the water
temperature being high and that because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a concern for me, because I live in
the desert and it's like, I think it's 113
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees outside and like inside here,
my AC is on the entire time and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: under, it's like 79 degrees Fahrenheit
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water temperature, if I were to run a
DWC system, I'd be struggling just like,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like you mentioned, because you need
to keep the temps at a certain degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to need to be below a certain
degrees or else you can come across
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can imagine why, why you're
going towards soil and how it's more,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more forgiving than a DWC
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you still with HPS?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you had that or did you
switch over to LED?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you using for light?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you lighting right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, right now I'm in flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm flowering with the Spider Farmer
SF4000 in the four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had, this would be my second flower with
the LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: The HPS was doing just great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could have continued with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may, if I struggle again,
I had a little bit of an issue with
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature in the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I am from the Northeast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though I get heat, I get heat and
AC from the house, it's still always a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, a little bit off than what it
actually is in the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, you know, now I've added a little
bit of, I just have a little oil heater in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I set that to like 72 and then
it never, it really gets below that down
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm, you know, I'm real lucky with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I, you know, a lot of people would say
I grow pretty, pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I never get above 80 degrees in
the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a real hot day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That must be nice for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always running an AC in order to try
to keep things cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, when it comes to lighting,
I want to dig a little bit deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: that because this, there's so much when it
comes to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's so easy to look at lighting,
you know, if you're shopping for lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing all these different technical
specifications and get over overwhelmed,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any general advice for like
beginners, maybe they're shopping for a
[SPEAKER_00]: light or even using light tips for using
lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, light, light's important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're going to veg,
light's a little less, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the kind of light you veg with is a little
less important than the kind of light you
[SPEAKER_02]: flower with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, your, your yield is, your yield is
based on your light, your wattage of your,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the amount of power that your
light is putting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, your quality is,
is really the grower talent, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the healthiness of your plant when you,
when you flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the different lights worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've seen people grow under
CFLs, you know, T flower under T5s,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can, you can flower under any of the
systems work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really, it's what you can really,
it's what you can afford.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that there's nothing wrong
with starting small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, as you, you know,
it's kind of what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just started, I just started small,
the HPS, an HPS system, a 600 watt HPS
[SPEAKER_02]: system, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, with a dimmable ballast,
you get two bulbs, the ballast,
[SPEAKER_02]: the hood, you know, it's pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, you have the wattage,
you know, a 600 watts and a four by four
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of really what you're,
what you want, you know, to really,
[SPEAKER_02]: to flower out a plant, you know,
and get some yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used, I used T5s in veg, and I just
liked the way, you know, I tried to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: little LED in veg, and you know,
it just, I liked the way the T5s work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I start with very little light,
I sprout with a two foot T5, and I just
[SPEAKER_02]: put it right on top of the dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's good for two,
three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that will sprout 50 seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you, you could fill all those
plugs and sprout with that one light,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that light will take care of it down
for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, you know, obviously you've got to,
you pull them out and you put them in
[SPEAKER_02]: party cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a little more space to part.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a two bulb T5.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have one of those little
divided up tents, you know, it's got the
[SPEAKER_02]: little shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got, so I have my little seedling dome
up top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down below, I've got a little two,
two bulb one.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm only sprouting a few, you know,
I can put them under that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have a four bulb one that fills
up kind of like a three by three space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they get a little bigger in
the solar cups, I can keep them all in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's all in that 24 hour light
cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that all works out great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I move them to a two by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got four, four foot T5 bulbs in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where I grow them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I try to fill that two by four
out, get a full canopy in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once that two by four is full,
that halfway fills my four.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I flip the flower,
the stretch, you know, they'll grow twice
[SPEAKER_02]: as big.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've got a full canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really kind of, you know,
I really try to stop the lighting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very slow incremental process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when they're little and they're
young, they don't need a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need a little bit of light.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that little bit of light is what
you're trying to grow roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're not trying to grow
vegetation, you know, in that early
[SPEAKER_02]: seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to get the roots to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just a little bit of light is all
they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cheap and it saves you a lot of
money too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're not blasting it with a,
you know, more light than it needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They respond a lot better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, you know, I strongly believe that,
you know, light is like kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: shifting gears in the car, you know,
it's got to be kind of working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you hit it at the end where,
you know, that last couple of weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're at 100% in your flower time,
you know, you know, you did it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're getting the mac, then your
plants are getting the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: lots, the maximum amount of light at the
end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really need it when they're,
when they're, you know, they're finishing
[SPEAKER_02]: off and can use that gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to repeat what you had
said towards the beginning there is the
[SPEAKER_00]: light that you could use.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people get caught up to like,
oh, you need 3000 K for flower and 4,000 K
[SPEAKER_00]: for vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just not entirely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can literally grow the plant from seed
to harvest with the same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of people there,
unfortunately they're beginners out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spending money on two different
grow lights in order to have them for the
[SPEAKER_00]: different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a little bit of an
overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just, they're just unknowingly going
on and spending money when they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you actually mentioned that
part because, yeah, that's a common
[SPEAKER_00]: misconception.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: About lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The spectrum is really little to do with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and if, and if it does it,
the difference is, is, is so small.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's really that noticeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people, you know, the light
companies will argue differently that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but it's kind of like,
they're kind of like the nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, you know, they're saying,
well, my light gives you 20% more if you
[SPEAKER_02]: use mine, you know, it's the, it's the
same sales technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tons of marketing getting shoved down your
throat.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's every light company has the
best light when you talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned too much light being an
issue for a lot of new growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get deeper into that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how do new growers know when they're
giving too much light and how do they
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I guess adjust their light to fix
the issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find that as we go through this
thing, that the too much thing will pop
[SPEAKER_02]: up, pop up a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a guy thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's probably why girls grow
better than we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just think more is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, more light, you know,
more nutrients, more water.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to give me more plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until you realize it's really not the
truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you, you, you step away
from some of that and you give it really
[SPEAKER_02]: what it needs and you know, nothing,
nothing more than, you know, with light
[SPEAKER_02]: they respond better.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, you know, you, you,
you can stunt them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really easy with too much light and it
causes, you know, you'll, you just burn
[SPEAKER_02]: them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I've seen people with,
you know, they end up with a beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy full of buds, but it's right up in
the light, you know, and it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: getting, they're just getting cooked by,
you know, just too much light because it
[SPEAKER_02]: got too close.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there needs to be like with my
led, my, my spider farm, I put it all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way to the top of the town.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's where I started,
even though my canopy is so low down
[SPEAKER_02]: there, I just use the knob to,
to, you know, dial it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I give them a little bit of
adjustment phase and I kind of,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, maybe that's a little much or back
it off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from then it's just like every
week when I water, I might turn it up a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit and kind of ease it up that
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, you know, it works out fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I first grow, you know, somebody had,
I was online and it's like, no,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to be hitting your plant with
that full 600 watts right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm like, Oh crap,
you know, I better get down there and turn
[SPEAKER_02]: that bail stuff, you know, and then,
you know, I'm blasting it with 600 watts,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, when they still should have been
way down, you know, and I had nowhere to
[SPEAKER_02]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no, you know, I was totally out
of gas, out of room to, to, to bring it up
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore or ease it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy who he has four solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got four seedlings going in a four by
four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got two spider farmer SF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two thousands, both of them going at the
same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm almost like, like I told them
before to his last girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them like, dude, you could like
just use one of those lights and like
[SPEAKER_00]: lower it and dim it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's not doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just all the way to the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 5% would be plenty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, especially the seedlings,
you know, I've, I've, I've, I've had a pop
[SPEAKER_02]: quite a few means, you know, I'm pretty
picky with seedlings, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty early on, you know, for plants,
you know, it's, it's, it's genetics or
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm looking for, you know,
branches cause that's where the buds grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, branches and nodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if they're going to stretchy,
I'm not seeing that node development or
[SPEAKER_02]: they're falling behind the other
seedlings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's literally off the cliff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one in my backyard with a kook and
they, they, they take the little ride down
[SPEAKER_02]: to the river.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you're in soil and you
mentioned you started with Fox farm
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, then you moved over to general
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's another area where folks get
caught up a lot, especially the new
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about, you know, how do you go
about feeding and what tips do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: for beginners in regards to feeding?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, currently, like I said,
I use a three part.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have RO water, so I have to use Cal Mag,
um, a little bit more than you normally
[SPEAKER_02]: see in the feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I use rapid start, um, in the
beginning and during veg, um, Floralicious
[SPEAKER_02]: plus and liquid cool bloom and,
uh, of course, great white.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that's kind of the stuff I use in
veg and flour, um, seedlings and baby
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use, you know, clonex solution,
you know, the first four weeks of their
[SPEAKER_02]: life, they're getting clonex solution and,
and great white every other week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the pretty new the mother plants,
but I, I, I ended up, I decided to stick
[SPEAKER_02]: with the same, um, clonex clonex brand and
I'm using the mother plant A and B for the
[SPEAKER_02]: mother plant going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up with a really, really nice,
uh, brand 80 purple that I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: using the clone with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I'm going to use, uh, orca clonex
solution in the, in the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, again, I, I, one thing I have to do,
you know, this might make people's jaws
[SPEAKER_02]: drop a little bit, but as far as NPK goes,
I only feed once in veg and at the most
[SPEAKER_02]: twice in flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's because I, I, I keep my,
you know, I don't let my plants get bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: than the container that they're in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I try to, you know, I'll, I mean,
you kind of get a feel for how long,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the soil's got a couple of weeks,
um, or how long it's, you need to feed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're, if they're growing along in
a good place and you're transplanting it,
[SPEAKER_02]: those right stages, you don't really need
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not saying that, you know,
I do give them like the supplements and
[SPEAKER_02]: the additives, you know, as I water them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, as far as really feeding
them, unless I'm seeing some kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency, you know, nitrogen,
you know, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, you know, I don't, you know,
they look a little yellow or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might need to feed them a little bit,
but I just don't, I, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I see people that they water every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get nutrients every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just, you know, I'm hitting it
hard with the newts and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm just like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what, you know, because that just
builds up all that salt and that soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just got nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's that you, especially,
you know, with the overwatering because,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you overwatering, you brought the
root hairs and that's, then they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: take up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, there's individual hairs
that pick up certain new parts and
[SPEAKER_02]: particulates, you know, and you burn them
up with nutrients or you overwater them
[SPEAKER_02]: and they can't take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All they can take up is water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, I have a buddy that,
um, every time he gets the flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: he goes, Oh, four weeks in the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: My plant, I come home, my plants just
fell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was, you know, he overwatered them
when he vaginal, they couldn't take up the
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen they needed in veg because they
don't take it up and flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they run out and they just go and
they just fall over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, you know, that's usually the
answer, you know, the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, the overwatering thing,
I really can't stress enough about,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think that's probably the number
one problem that new growers do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think that soil has to be wet all the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, this plant just, just not like
that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about watering in order to
ensure that there's overwatering doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: happen?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I always water, when I water,
I water to runoff and make sure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: pot is completely saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got water coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm careful that I'm not, you know,
trying to do it too fast where I'm getting
[SPEAKER_02]: the runoff off the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, you gotta get a feel of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get a feel of the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how much it is when it's heavy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I don't water it again until I
can just pick it up with my finger.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like super light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just wait until it's,
it's dried, dried out, or I see some kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of, if it looks like it's, you know,
wilting a little bit, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll, these are kind of bend down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try, I don't like it to, you know,
underwatering is bad too, but it's not as
[SPEAKER_02]: bad as overwatering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can, if you start seeing wilting,
you know, okay, if you write everything
[SPEAKER_02]: down, which I also recommend if you,
got a garden you should be, if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: watering, feeding, you should be at least
writing that down, water feed or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, you know, at the very bare
minimum so that you can go, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: I watered five days ago, wilted today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next time I water, I'm going to do it a
day earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, uh, my, like my,
uh, I have the flower plant I have is in a
[SPEAKER_02]: seven gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the first four weeks, I only
watered it once a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just now, you know, in week five,
I'm starting to water it almost twice a
[SPEAKER_02]: week.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just starting to take up a lot more
water and it's starting to bulk up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's drinking and taking up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a very similar method where I let it
dry out between waterings when I'm growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with synthetic nutrients in particular,
dry backs like that drought stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that that helps with
the secondary metabolites, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: those dry comb production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, it's a form of stress,
precision stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's bringing out what we want in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, yeah, I thought that was worth
mentioning there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you aiming for a specific EC or
PPM during the different stages of growth
[SPEAKER_00]: or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, well, I kind of, I kind of look at
PPM, like food calories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you've got a young plant, um,
you give it the kid's meal, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lower calorie diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you got a big plant that's,
you know, it might need to supersize fries
[SPEAKER_02]: and to go on with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of based on the size,
um, type of plant, you know, some grow
[SPEAKER_02]: slower than others, a slower growing plant
doesn't need as much as a, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: a faster growing one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, it's not like the, it's kind of
like the couch potato versus the athlete,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, ones that are like certain,
certain cultivars grow really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah, there's a relationship between
heat nutrients and the amount of water the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant drinks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so if it's, you've got hot
temperatures and the plants drinking twice
[SPEAKER_02]: as much water, you also got to remember
it's taking up twice as many nutrients as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, if you're, if you're,
if you're putting a lot of nutrients in
[SPEAKER_02]: there and you're tense running at a very
high temperature, you know, it's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you run the risk of, uh, you know,
burning your plants up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I, I want to say all the
thing you want to do as a new growers,
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to eliminate as many places that
you can go wrong as possible, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: take those variables out, you know,
don't, don't work hard to throw things in
[SPEAKER_02]: that can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just, just because, you know,
you, you've seen it on YouTube or you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you've read it on the internet
or, you know, some, you know, your buddy
[SPEAKER_02]: told you this is, this is what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to get into pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about how pH was super
important when it comes to DWC hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people argue that it's not as
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on pH specifically when
growing in soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about, do you monitor pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I aim between five and seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm mixing my nutrients and they're out
of that range, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some, sometimes I have, you know,
I'll get, I use a lot more pH up for some
[SPEAKER_02]: reason, probably because of the RO water
than I do down.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I bring it back and I'll
add a little bit to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it gets five point something or six
point something, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not adding more to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to dial in that number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, because that is that you don't realize
how big of a range that really is because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not really a linear scale pH,
like the difference between, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, six point nine pH and seven is,
is, it's actually 10 times difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you multiply that over the whole
range between five and seven, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's such a wide range that why would,
how could there be one specific number
[SPEAKER_02]: that is absolutely perfect, you know,
for every situation?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really it's about, um,
you know, I know people argue that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: a certain pH, it makes nutrients more
available to the plant, but that five to
[SPEAKER_02]: seven range covers it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's not going to be any,
any kind of thing going on there unless
[SPEAKER_02]: there's an issue with overwatering and you
brought through repairs and they can't
[SPEAKER_02]: absorb the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to environment a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aim for certain ranges for
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you usually aim for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, my lung room will basically vary
anywhere between 65 and 75 degrees,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, depending on what kind of season
it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and I try to keep temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I basically try to keep the lung room
comfortable for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I know if it's comfortable for me,
it's comfortable for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, obviously the lights, you know,
add heat or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I've had no, you know,
when I've had no issues, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had 10, 15 degree, um, temperature
swings at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely no, no real issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the only time temperature really might
be an issue for me is when I got seedlings
[SPEAKER_02]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I might use a little heat mat
just to, you know, kind of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: more radiant heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I don't really, I mean,
I monitor it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to know what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tells me if something's wrong,
if my, you know, if I, if I, I see that my
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity all of a sudden is 70%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I must've forgot to empty the dehumidifier
or, you know, it's, it's more of a,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking for the extremes more than a
precise area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of just like, I treat it just like
the pH is if I'm in that happy zone
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere, um, I'm not going to spend a
whole lot of effort to chase a number or
[SPEAKER_02]: get a like VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I don't really worry about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't, you know, there's,
there's no VPD and mother nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say, you know, the,
it's, it's just, it's just not for the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of effort that it would take to try
to maintain, um, that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see the need to chase
something like that, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: starting out, maybe if you're in a
facility and you're, you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: dial, you know, I mean, you're,
I don't know, even then I wouldn't,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I wouldn't see the value.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no value way I didn't for me and
my grow split that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying there's something wrong
with it or whatever, but it's just not
[SPEAKER_02]: something that, you know, that I focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are actually within the
VPD range without even trying,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they'll look at the chart and
they'll be like, Oh, I'm there already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not even like no effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: My AC infinity, my AC infinity control
result.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives me a VPD reading and that's a
little off because I don't, I don't enter
[SPEAKER_02]: the leaf temperature or anything,
but it's always one, two, one,
[SPEAKER_02]: three, you know, it's always right around
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not that far off,
you know, depending on what chart you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's all these different charts
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, which chart is the
real chart?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's a, why Jake,
why spend the time?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several charts out there and it
makes things confusing because you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: one chart and you think you're in the
right range and looking at another chart
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, there's that, that dark green
range, which is said to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the light green range and
then there's the yellow range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the tolerance range and then
you've got the red range, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's a really, really wide
range that the plant will grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a beginner, yeah,
chasing after VPD, probably don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that for you for several grows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that was, that was something I
picked up growing outdoors too,
[SPEAKER_02]: because I mean the Northeast is just the,
it could, you can get all four seasons in
[SPEAKER_02]: like one day here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I, the first year I'm like,
aren't you worried?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like, it hasn't rained in like
three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he's like, Oh, I gave him water
a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and I'm like, Oh my gosh,
did you see that wind last night?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it was through the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then towards the end,
you know, that towards the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's dropping down to like 45 at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, isn't it getting too cold at
night?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and the planting does great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never, you know, I've seen wild swing
swings and outdoor temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: hail, you know, you name it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it'll throw it at that plant and it
does great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it helps, you know, the plant,
like you said, the stress, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: the stress, I remember one plant we put
outside and the woodchuck split it right
[SPEAKER_02]: down and just took it and split it right
down the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we duct tape it all up, put a tomato,
correct a tomato cage around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant was the biggest yielding
plant that we, we ever had.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that whatever it was, it just kicked
it into like some kind of super mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe the stock splitting technique
isn't actually bro science.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, if you shake, if you shake
your plants up, you, you, you
[SPEAKER_02]: inadvertently are going to split stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, it's, you know, you remember
the first time that you ever topped your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and you're holding the clippers
there and your hands are shaking and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like, Oh my God, what am I about to do
here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you cut that off and you know,
the first time you're trying to bend a
[SPEAKER_02]: branch and you just, you just split it or
you break it and you're like, Oh crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but it's just, it's duct tape
fixes, fixes quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, you know, if it does,
you know, when it does heal, it's a big
[SPEAKER_02]: knuckle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, you know, it's the plant responds
pretty good to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't be afraid to main handle them a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they like it when you,
when you bend them and break them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are resilient plants and most of the
time they will recover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fully one more thing I want to touch upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched upon it first when we talked
about temperature and I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: circle back to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll move on, which is you
talked about the long room temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really, really glad you brought
that up because that's an important piece
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of people don't bring up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just talk about the temperature in
their grow environment, in their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their grow tent, for example, but the long
room for those that don't know is the room
[SPEAKER_00]: that your grow tent is in, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people will condition that
room with the proper temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said, this between 65 and 75
degrees Fahrenheit, which is usually
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly lower than what people typically
run in their grow tents, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 75 upwards of 80, sometimes up to 85
degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important because when you're
bringing air into the grow environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're aiming for 80 degrees Fahrenheit
temperature, for example, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in your grow tent and that's what's
in your long room.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my experience, I've always run into
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my long room is similar temperature to
what's in my grow tent, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just bringing in more heat, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And your growth, your grow light is
creating that heat and you're just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just running into heat issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a great tip is to run a
little bit lower of a temp in your long
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course having it to be the proper
humidity that you're aiming for,
[SPEAKER_00]: have that in your long room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the air you're bringing into your grow
tent is of the ideal range.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you start having to add heat or
cooling, you're adding money to your grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, once you do that,
is it cost efficient to grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you've got to spend a lot of
money, I'm fortunate that I have the
[SPEAKER_02]: ducting, you know, already there,
you know, and I could add just a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of supplemental heat, you know,
at the times that it needs it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and then I can put it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: The heater and the dehumidifier I have,
they're both about, I think the heater is
[SPEAKER_02]: a little more watts, but I'll use,
I'll use the heater in the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I use the dehumidifier in the
summer and at the, you know, I don't use
[SPEAKER_02]: the two at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just works out, it works out well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just fortunate with the grow space
that I have that maintains such a good
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can certainly be super expensive when
you have all those equipment, heater,
[SPEAKER_00]: air conditioner, dehumidifier,
all those things add up in your
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I've had shock before looking
at my electricity bill, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the heck happened here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically when I was running a portable
air conditioner and I got rid of it
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was just like, forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's financially, it's just, it's not
worth it to run it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, definitely one thing to evaluate
is how much equipment you're having and
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the dehumidifier, you know,
I have one of those things that test the
[SPEAKER_02]: lots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no clue that that thing was drawing
600 watts, you know, that's as much as,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's another light in your grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and that's, you know,
my first grow, I was running that thing
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm glad I figured that out and
I don't have to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, it's definitely good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less energy consumption, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that a lot of new growers do can
be very beneficial for numerous reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about how you do your plant
training.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I start right in the solo cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as I start seeing those,
those developing on the, on the brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: branches on the stems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've got a couple nodes there
and it looks like a good, good spot to nip
[SPEAKER_02]: it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll, I'll nip that top off right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you call it feminine, just taking
the one top node, you know, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: debate on what, what it means,
but anyways, I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I also clean up the bottoms,
anything that's not going to catch up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the top, any lower branches, I'll cut them
off early too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I start, start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a plant goes, I'm always trying to open
up the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal is to make the plant low and wide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want big tall legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call them facility legs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you see those videos of the
facilities and you know, the legs are like
[SPEAKER_02]: six feet long and then there's like this
three foot canopy, but your light only,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, LED will penetrate two feet,
HPS three feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where did all that time go to grow all
the, you know, all those legs,
[SPEAKER_02]: all that leg is kind of wasted time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially, you know, if you're in a
facility and you have 20 foot ceilings and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can have your lights all the way up
there, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to, if you're growing in 10,
you know, you can only get so high,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the taller, you know,
as I learned on my first grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very, you know, once you,
a lot of people don't, don't anticipate
[SPEAKER_02]: the stretch either.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They, you know, topping your plant,
I think is the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see a lot of new growers where they grow
like the spears where there's just one
[SPEAKER_02]: giant big bud in the center and then a
couple auxiliaries off the top,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because it, you know,
if you don't top that plant, that top
[SPEAKER_02]: apical bud is going to get all the energy,
all those other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just getting the scraps,
what's left over, you know, when the big
[SPEAKER_02]: bud eats, you know, they just get the
table scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you top your plant, you widen them
out, that is, the energy is distributed
[SPEAKER_02]: more evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you might not get this sphere of a
bud, but you're going to get the tops,
[SPEAKER_02]: which, you know, we all know that's the,
that's the best part of the bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I bend them, I break them,
you know, when I'm trying to widen them
[SPEAKER_02]: out, you know, if I get, I get,
I can either top them to, to shorten them
[SPEAKER_02]: up, to let the other branches catch up or
I can bend them down and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't tie them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's a effective way to do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, the plant's pretty
strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can tie it down and it will
turn a corner and still go straight up on
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you, if you, if you break the
herd, you bend the branch when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: down, you know, I, you know, I'll go down
there and check to see if the buckets are
[SPEAKER_02]: light or something, you know, well,
that, that one's a little too tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give it a little twist and bend it
down a little bit, trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: always building it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about the canopy, canopy,
canopy, canopy, right from the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm during the solar cups, right up to
when I put them in the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to clarify, you can totally just
grow the plant naturally and let that one
[SPEAKER_00]: cola come up, but you are prone to bud
rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I, I encountered that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's tough getting air through
the buds there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's stagnant air at all,
I actually had a fan that died and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, it died overnight and the mold started
to occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got the fan fixed, but I didn't notice it
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had the plants continue to grow for a
couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that mold just doesn't stop growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can, you know, continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you've got the air flow at that
point, you're screwed, but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you haven't fit your first grow,
grow the plant naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But training is definitely beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just like you mentioned,
it can't be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really can't be, I know, I know for
some people, you know, they, like they see
[SPEAKER_02]: the beautiful, I don't want to cut that
off my client.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's such a, it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growing so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to chop its head off.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you kidding me?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the benefits, you know,
of training far outweigh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the, you know, as long as you're doing it
correctly, you know, you're not,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not doing anything crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, shaping up your clients is,
you know, it's super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're coming up towards the end of the
episode and I know we can't talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: every single thing there is to do about
growing here, but I do want to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: one last opportunity to give advice for
beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something maybe that we missed in
this episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: Something you think that's super important
that new growers need to hear?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, start small, keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you, I think you want to make
sure growing is for you first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some people it's just not,
you might have a really weird environment,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and it just, or, you know,
just some people just, it's just not for
[SPEAKER_02]: them, you know, and then they end up
spending a lot of money in the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're just discouraged.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just start small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, a lot of, in a lot of
most first time growers, they fit,
[SPEAKER_02]: they do fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, don't be afraid to fail, you know,
and, you know, embrace it, learn from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I really took a hard look at
my first grow and I didn't give up and saw
[SPEAKER_02]: my equipment and I said, what did I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: What could I do better?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still do it after every grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what can I, you know,
what can I do better next time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and also take everything you see on
YouTube, read on the internet with a grain
[SPEAKER_02]: of salt, you know, kind of do,
you know, do your own back research too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see something on one site and I
don't know about that, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to look around and see, and soon you'll
find out that there's a contradiction for
[SPEAKER_02]: just for everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start to learn that,
you know, I need to, you need to form your
[SPEAKER_02]: own opinions about, about things and not
rely on somebody else.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no secret recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's got no, there's no YouTube
channel or we've got some secret recipe
[SPEAKER_02]: that, okay, here's the list of things that
you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're going to get a tent full
of buzz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think that we, we think,
you know, people think we're hiding some
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of secret, you know, secret sauce.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been, there's no secret nutrient,
you know, no, no, no secret light.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no secret technique or
secret method.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's a lot of different
ways work, but you just can't give up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, don't, don't quit if it's
something you really want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and leave your plants alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think I touched on that earlier at
all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you don't need to be down in your tent
like 17 times a day, opening it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, then looking, um, in there,
they, you know, you don't need,
[SPEAKER_02]: you just, you just leave them,
you know, you, you do your water and you
[SPEAKER_02]: do things you got to do and you just leave
them alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're opening and closing the
tank and changing the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you go into your grill,
you're, you run the risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might bring some kind of pest in there
or, you know, or, or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might forget to turn the light off
when you leave, you know, go down there
[SPEAKER_02]: when you got to go down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, I go down to check a quick,
you know, I might go down once a day just
[SPEAKER_02]: to make sure everything's still running.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, nothing's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: What helped me, cause it was hard for me
to let go of it too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you, you know, you're so interested
in invested in this that you would just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to be down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I bought some cameras that I can
look on my phone, you know, so I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking, I don't know what's going on
down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, thinking in my head,
maybe I want to go down there and see
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just go in the camera and look on
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn the camera off and, you know,
thought leaves my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's real important just to,
the plant's been grown on its own for
[SPEAKER_02]: millions of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really needs very little from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we just got to really stay out
of its way and let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, like grow time always
says, you know, relax, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: breathe.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, it's just, it's really
just a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really just the house plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's, there's, when you look at it
like that and it's, and you treat them
[SPEAKER_02]: like that, you, you get a lot more
success.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the way you go about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the right mindset for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to add in one more tip that just
coming to my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking back to when I was a
beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that helped me was setting up
the equipment and before even putting the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the tent and having the light
on, having your humidifier on your
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation, all hooked up and then
monitoring the temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and seeing if it's in the range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeing if you don't have your temperature
spiking like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can take action before you put
plants in there and then try to balance
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, this isn't going to be
foolproof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you have plants in there,
the plants transpire, they release water
[SPEAKER_00]: vapor into the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to adjust your humidity,
but it can certainly, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: be beneficial to have the equipment in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have your light on, let it run and then
monitor and try to adjust things from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just figure I'd throw that one out
there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong with monitoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's good to know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad I did in my first grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed quite right away, as soon as the
lights went out, because my ambient room
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature was low, once that HPS cuts
off, it cools off pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: That tent cools off pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once that tent cools off, the humidity
just went.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it told me something.
[SPEAKER_02]: It told me I needed more ventilation in my
tent to account for the fact when the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights go off and that humidity rises so
that I'm not getting it raining in my tent
[SPEAKER_02]: after the lights go out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's good to know these things,
but like I said, don't chase a VPD number,
[SPEAKER_02]: a pH number, the PAR thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just look at your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll tell you what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more is not better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes the more you do, the less you
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my YouTube channel is pretty small.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Chronics Grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you said you put a link down
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also on Instagram on the same name.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be trying to pump up the
membership on that pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I ended up having COVID twice in 15
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my YouTube channel suffered a little
bit and pretty much just making music
[SPEAKER_02]: videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: With plants in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned earlier, I'm about to start
clowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to do some videos on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a Tribal Cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to document the whole process,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that big plant I have, that single
plant I have in flower, that should be
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting in maybe three more weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last harvest I was mustering.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's around the time-lapse video.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a lot of fun with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's convincing the whole chopping process
and bucking the buds on to a three-minute
[SPEAKER_02]: video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really took all these hours just to
watch that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think next up I've got some black
widows.
[SPEAKER_02]: I end up with three black widows and one
white widow out of the last batch of beans
[SPEAKER_02]: that I popped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're looking really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping to get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider Farmer sent me one of their new
8x4.
[SPEAKER_02]: They started making the bigger tens now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got one of the 8x4s when they first
came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just waiting to get the right
opportunity to get that set up and then
[SPEAKER_02]: double my flower space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, hopefully document it the whole
way and widows can follow along and watch
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like a lot of exciting stuff
upcoming in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to his channel
down in the YouTube description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
