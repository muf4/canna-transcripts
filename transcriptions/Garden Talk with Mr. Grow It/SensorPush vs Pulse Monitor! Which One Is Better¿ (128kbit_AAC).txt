[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grote and I'm back with another video I
have the pulse monitor here with me some
[SPEAKER_00]: of you may have this and also I have the
sensor push monitor here a couple of them
[SPEAKER_00]: actually and Figured I would do a video
comparing the two so there have been quite
[SPEAKER_00]: a few people that have hit me up in the
past A lot of you know that I run the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor push monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about it a lot in many of my videos
But some people have been asking how does
[SPEAKER_00]: the pulse compare to that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're gonna go over today
First thing we'll talk about is the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimensions weight then we'll get into what
the units actually measure Bluetooth first
[SPEAKER_00]: Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some of the features
We'll get into the app and then lastly
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion But first big thanks to happy
hydro for sponsoring this video Happy
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro now has complete grow tank kits and
many of the kits actually come with my
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner girl book the kits consist of AC
infinity grow tents and AC infinity
[SPEAKER_00]: ventilation system Your choice of lighting
whether it be spider farmer HLG the green
[SPEAKER_00]: sunshine company or grow his choice So hum
living soil nutrients oscillating fans and
[SPEAKER_00]: more I will leave a link to happy hydro
grow tank kits down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below And you can use coupon code
mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it for a discount on their products
So right off the bat, you can see that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are definitely a big difference in
size here The sensor pushes 1.75 inches by
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.75 inches by 0.65 Inches and the weight
is 1.4 ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pulse is gonna be quite a bit bigger
actually This measures 4.5 inches by 2.5
[SPEAKER_00]: inches by 1.125 inches and the weight is
2.9 ounces You can't actually hang both of
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do is I hang them at canopy
level There's a little hole here You can
[SPEAKER_00]: slide I usually slide the light ratchet
rope through it tie it and then hang it
[SPEAKER_00]: down You can do the same thing with this
so it would be a little bit easier with
[SPEAKER_00]: this This hole is a little bit small for
battery life The sensor push really has
[SPEAKER_00]: this one beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna take one of those smaller CR
2477 batteries and that's gonna last one
[SPEAKER_00]: to two years according to their website
The pulse is actually gonna take three AA
[SPEAKER_00]: batteries, which is gonna last you four
months So a lot less battery life.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, you can actually plug in there is
a spot You can actually plug in and then
[SPEAKER_00]: run a line directly to your wall outlet So
you wouldn't have to worry about batteries
[SPEAKER_00]: at all with the pulse Now what I'm just
showing you here is just a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: different models, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the pulse one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have a pulse pro And then the
sensor push has three models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the ht1 the ht.w and the htp.xw
I think a fair comparison would be with
[SPEAKER_00]: the ht.w comparing with the pulse one
There are some features that are different
[SPEAKER_00]: which we'll go over here in a minute But
that's kind of the closest I would say so
[SPEAKER_00]: the sensor push ht1 is their cheapest
model It's gonna be at $49.99 current
[SPEAKER_00]: price I kind of hate mentioning prices
sometimes in videos because they do change
[SPEAKER_00]: the price So somebody in my comments say
hey the price has changed This information
[SPEAKER_00]: is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah expect the price to potentially
change right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ht1 is $49.99.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is ht1 right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the oldest model that they have
actually bought this one back in 2017 so
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it for many many years still
works only I've had to change the battery
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once on this one measures the
temperature humidity And I believe now
[SPEAKER_00]: they've changed it so it can calculate VPD
as well Maybe dew point as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but don't quote me on that the next model
up the ht.w that one does temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity VPD and dew point and it's gonna
be a little bit more accurate when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to the temperature and humidity plus
or minus 2% for relative humidity and then
[SPEAKER_00]: plus or minus 0.2 degrees Celsius or plus
or minus 0.36 Fahrenheit the ht.w is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: run you $64.99 It's a little bit more
expensive than the ht1 and then the htp.xw
[SPEAKER_00]: Measures temperature humidity as VPD dew
point and also barometer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Air pressure it's measuring current
price on that is $89.99.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course a little bit more expensive
than the other models And I believe the
[SPEAKER_00]: htp.xw is a little more accurate as well
pulse one is $199 so $199 for the pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna measure the same thing as the
sensor push temperature humidity VPD dew
[SPEAKER_00]: point as well as light intensity So one
additional thing that it measures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be as accurate as the
sensor push unfortunately, so they're
[SPEAKER_00]: reporting Plus or minus 3% for humidity
plus or minus 1% for temperature and then
[SPEAKER_00]: plus or minus 4% for VPD sensor push did
not mention what their plus or minus was
[SPEAKER_00]: for VPD So pretty big price difference
there in regards to the units,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's a good reason for that and
that's the connectivity So the sensor push
[SPEAKER_00]: is bluetooth only the bluetooth range on
this is 100 meters about 325 feet data is
[SPEAKER_00]: collected at 1 minute intervals also alert
ranges can be set for temperature humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD dew point so you can be Alerted when
there is a problem when things are out of
[SPEAKER_00]: range you get a push notification directly
to your phone Or you can ask Alexa which
[SPEAKER_00]: is new to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't hooked this up to Alexa yet
There is a Wi-Fi adapter for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the sensor push g1 Wi-Fi
gateway and that's gonna run $100 So good
[SPEAKER_00]: comparison would be the sensor push ht.w
That's gonna run you $64.99 plus the Wi-Fi
[SPEAKER_00]: gateway, which is $99.99.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're looking at about $165 for the
sensor push with the Wi-Fi capability And
[SPEAKER_00]: again comparing to the pulse is 199 total
this already has Wi-Fi built in you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually need Wi-Fi in order to use this
so From my understanding there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: Bluetooth on this device at all for the
sensor push one mobile device can monitor
[SPEAKER_00]: an unlimited number of sensors and one
sensor can be monitored by an unlimited
[SPEAKER_00]: number of mobile devices for the pulse
unlimited number of sensors including
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple locations and Wi-Fi networks
Viewable on one dashboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't find out how long the data Is
stored for the pulse but for the sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: push 45 days of storage on the sensor and
unlimited in-app storage for unlimited
[SPEAKER_00]: devices on their database One thing I
really like the sensor push is you can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually extract the data to a CSV file So
really you can put that into Excel Google
[SPEAKER_00]: Sheets other programs like that and then
you'll be able to manipulate the data as
[SPEAKER_00]: you wish I'm pretty sure you can't do that
with the pulse which is unfortunate I know
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people do like to extract the
data and manipulate it to see different
[SPEAKER_00]: Trends and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's take a look at the apps First up
is the sensor push app.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one two three four different
devices loaded up here Let's just click on
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the devices will do two by four
canopy See it takes a little bit to load
[SPEAKER_00]: the data not too long This is actually in
my two foot by four foot grow tent and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: actually not using this tent right now So
you can see significant changes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity as far as the
graph It's just it's pretty big swings
[SPEAKER_00]: there is what I'm trying to say But you
can see a section for temperature a
[SPEAKER_00]: section for relative humidity a section
for VPD as well gives you a little summary
[SPEAKER_00]: at the bottom there and then a chance to
Export the data as a CSV file like I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before you can see the data by
the hour You can see the data by the day
[SPEAKER_00]: by the week by the month and even by the
year as well Then in the settings you can
[SPEAKER_00]: set a high and low limit for temperature
relative humidity barometric pressure dew
[SPEAKER_00]: point and VPD So you can see for example,
I have my relative humidity high set for
[SPEAKER_00]: 70% and low set for 40% I don't have the
alerts on if I put the alerts on here I
[SPEAKER_00]: would get a alert when it is out of range
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not using a tent So I'm keeping the
alerts off down here in VPD You can see I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a high or low limit set.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I can easily add in when
I want There's also a spot for leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature offset, which you can see here
and read here the explanation for that
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much the sensor push app and
not Shell now let's go into the pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor app.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, there we go So I just have one
pulse monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that it looks like there's a
battery alert on there So I have a low
[SPEAKER_00]: battery need to change that soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick view of the dashboard see the
temperature humidity Light VPD dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure click in on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some more data see a spectral
analysis There's some settings here change
[SPEAKER_00]: Wi-Fi settings VPD leaf temperature
offset.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can calibrate the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also calibrate on The sensor push
I just didn't show that part usually as a
[SPEAKER_00]: graph here I'm not sure why the graph
isn't showing but usually you would see a
[SPEAKER_00]: graph here see a lot of different
information alert settings It's definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more extensive than the sensor push
app You can do daytime settings nighttime
[SPEAKER_00]: settings up here You have a calendar that
you can actually go in and edit can do
[SPEAKER_00]: different entries for things that you did
new events For example, there are also
[SPEAKER_00]: different templates here that you can use
to manage settings across multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: devices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh just noticing now You actually can
export the data into CSV just like sensor
[SPEAKER_00]: push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't aware of that That's awesome
that they have that because I know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people that Really like to
extract the data and manipulate it so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can see different trends and such and
that's pretty much the pulse app in a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutshell So there's a quick comparison of
the pulse monitor versus a sensor push
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor since the push monitor is gonna be
significantly smaller than the pulse
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor However, the sensor push only has
a Bluetooth enabled so you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually buy a Wi-Fi adapter if you want
the Wi-Fi capability pulse monitor already
[SPEAKER_00]: has Wi-Fi built into it both of these
measure temperature humidity VPD dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: however with the pulse one You're actually
gonna get light intensity as well Accuracy
[SPEAKER_00]: sensor push is gonna be a little bit more
accurate than the pulse monitor and then
[SPEAKER_00]: for the actual app on your phone You're
gonna get more with the pulse app I
[SPEAKER_00]: personally would like to see the sensor
push add-in co2 monitoring pulse has
[SPEAKER_00]: another monitor called the pulse Pro it
has co2 It also has par measurements in
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD So I think the next step for sensor
push would be to add the co2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially add in PPFD measurements as
well I certainly didn't go over all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: details for each of these monitors in this
video That would make this video way too
[SPEAKER_00]: long just the features that I thought were
pretty important for Monitoring your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What features did I miss that you think I
should have mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below which monitor do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use the pulse?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use the sensor push or do you use a
different monitor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below links to all these sensor push
[SPEAKER_00]: models with the Wi-Fi gateway and also the
pulse one and pulse Pro will be down in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description section below if I have
coupon codes for you I will link those
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the description section below and
yeah, I'll leave it at that Thank you so
[SPEAKER_00]: much for watching and until next time pace
You You You You
