[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using some synthetic line of
nutrients and what's the EC or PPM that
[SPEAKER_00]: you aim for for the different stages of
growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I'm running all salt based
nutrients right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, I've been running Athena.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been liking it a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first run with Athena and I've
also recently been running auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I'm not used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually I might be and a lot of times
I'm just testing this in like a PPM
[SPEAKER_01]: reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of times in veg, I might be
getting up to 700 or 800 PPMs in the peak
[SPEAKER_01]: of veg and then maybe even over a thousand
PPMs in the peak of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found that these auto flowers I've
been running, it's just a few,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they seem to like a lot or need a lot
less nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been running about half of that
strength with the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've pretty much been taking the feeding
chart that Athena recommends and just
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting it straight in half and it's been
working really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a common question that people
ask is about auto flowers and their
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often here that it requires less
nutrition and there's some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: say, no, it requires the same amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one of like the debated
topics amongst the community is whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not auto should be treating differently
when it comes to feedings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to hear your
experience that, yeah, you've had to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: the dose in half there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I tried, I went with the full
strength and I could just, you could see
[SPEAKER_01]: the normal signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see the leaf tip burn starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just backed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I let it go for maybe a whole
week before I was like, I gotta change
[SPEAKER_01]: this reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it felt like too much because I
think what it was recommending even early
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg was 1,100 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it said that this formulation is made
to run at a higher EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, all right, let's,
let's try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never tried these nutrients before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go with what they recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it was just this particular
cultivar because the whole plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, finished is only this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it makes sense that it doesn't need
that much salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: True.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some auto flowers can grow massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some stay squat really comes down
to genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it comes down to other things,
the lighting, environment, nutrition,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, some could be real small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense for those smaller plants
to need lesser nutrition, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now mixing up those nutrients in water,
what is your water source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just using tap water or are you
filtering the water in some way like
[SPEAKER_00]: reverse osmosis or what's your water
source?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 75 gallon per day RO filter in
the house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hooked up underneath my kitchen
sink and it's off 90% of the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I know like every time I'm about to
have to say, I have to fill my reservoir
[SPEAKER_01]: tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go ahead and turn on the filter
tonight, fill me up a few five gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets and get ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always have the RO water at the
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about going and
trying to get distilled water,
[SPEAKER_01]: worrying about what's in my water supply,
because I know just a few years ago here
[SPEAKER_01]: in Denver.
