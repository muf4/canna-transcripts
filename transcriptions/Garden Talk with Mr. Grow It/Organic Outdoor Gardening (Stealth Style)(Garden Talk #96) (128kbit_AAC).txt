[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really important to visit that site
many times of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, go there in the morning,
go there in the evening, go there sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: In amongst the other plants, it sort of
looks like stinging nettles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a sort of green mass,
isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best advice I could have is get yourself a
dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you don't have a dog, buy yourself a
dog lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least if you're found out in the world
and you've got a dog lead, you can at
[SPEAKER_01]: least protect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretend you're looking for your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to get down the rabbit
hole and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much fun and it's so many good,
positive things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing for your mental health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all those good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't recommend it highly enough,
but have an understanding of consequence
[SPEAKER_01]: and just have an exit plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Mr. Poodle420.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very good, thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for joining.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a fantastic thumbnail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super psyched.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited that you decided to disguise your
identity and fit your character.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: All about the fun now, and here we are
back in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still hard to see who I am, but slightly
better audio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to talk about gorilla
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are a gorilla grower and have to
implement stealth practices in order to be
[SPEAKER_00]: successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, I'd like to get into
what you do, but first, how about
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been gardening, I think,
probably sort of illegally for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, the sort of turn point was
that sort of sense of quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it comes down to that idea of the
difference between a cake you bake
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and one you buy from the shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the day you learn to bake a
cake that is amazing, that you do it at
[SPEAKER_01]: home, you suddenly go, oh, hang on a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what it came down to
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That for me was a bit of a sea change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was buying medicinal plants in a sea
city where they were being adulterated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spice was a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are spraying stuff on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your option is one, which sort of makes
you feel like you're sort of having a
[SPEAKER_01]: mental breakdown because it's so strong
when the philosophy of the people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing that medicinal plant is,
I want something that makes you do
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like being in a bar where they only
sell spirits and all you want is a beer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think ultimately, it's that the cake
you bake yourself is the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what really brought me to the
table and sort of access and sort of that
[SPEAKER_01]: quality and the lack of wanting to be
anything to do with the criminality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of things wrong with an
illegal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, you take control of your
destiny and it's not difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's often for people that
barrier is that sort of you get into a
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of habit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tapped into that illegal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, there's ways to do that that
isn't illegal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have that independence and the
internet provides you with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is a world outside there that
you can just get involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the guerrilla grade comes
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what I want to sort of
convey and inspire people to think,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there's another way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to be involved in that
criminality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can get involved in doing things
totally differently that takes you out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that and gives you just like, you know,
that home-baked cake experience when
[SPEAKER_01]: you've only ever had shop or stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, that's basically what I hope
to inspire people to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's where I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly is guerrilla growing and why
do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think for a lot of people that
maybe have no space, no, don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They live in a city in a flat area and a
space, we don't have a garden or maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: live with a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just couldn't grow stuff that maybe
people would frown on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you live in a part of the world
where maybe that's illegal, then,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, having stuff rooted in the
ground, you know, or in a pot or it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: liability makes you vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the problem with all this sort
of illegality, it makes you really
[SPEAKER_01]: vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be a partner, that can be a
friend, that can be all sorts of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes you really vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got it in the ground in your
garden, in your thing, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you don't get it with your
neighbor, you're vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas no one's ever been prosecuted for
growing a tree in a forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe you don't have a garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you live in a flat in a city and
you're thinking, you know, I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's expensive and maybe
the cost of living prices, it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe you could go on a bus ride or a
train ride and you're sort of suddenly in
[SPEAKER_01]: the countryside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you just go somewhere frequently
and you find a place that you can put
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the ground and maybe you
visit it once a week and hey, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the liability of that versus having it in
your garden that's there every day and all
[SPEAKER_01]: the vulnerability that comes with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's a better alternative for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's something we can explore
with this podcast this evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you determine a good piece of land
or a spot to grow in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it comes down to,
I mean, I think the best advice I could
[SPEAKER_01]: have is get yourself a dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you don't have a dog, buy yourself a
dog lead.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least if you're found out in the world
and you've got a dog that you can at least
[SPEAKER_01]: pretend you're looking for your dog.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the thing about a dog is
people see the dog and not the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're out in the world,
in the countryside and you've got a dog,
[SPEAKER_01]: people see the dog, not the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a pretty good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dogs are amazing for your mental
health, amazing for just like your soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why wouldn't you have a dog if you
could?
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately it's about, there's a lot
of countryside that is available and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of footpaths.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly in a lot of countries that you
can go along and you can find a space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose it's about going out there,
finding something that's a way off the
[SPEAKER_01]: footpath, a little bit hidden,
a little bit discreet, no straight lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a zigzag path.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to find a spot that gets sun all
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to find somewhere that's sort of,
now's a good time to go and look.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you can sort of see what the
growth was when it was sort of the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are all out and stuff, but you can sort of
start to sneak in through that and find a
[SPEAKER_01]: space that maybe could be perfect for your
gorilla growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once you identify a site to grow in
or a piece of property, an area,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you prepare that site?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's really important to
visit that site many times of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go there in the morning, go there in the
evening, go there sort of midday.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have optimum that peak time of
the day where it's sort of optimum sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want it to be sunny, but you sort of
ideally want it to be sunny all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be there from sort of dawn to
dusk getting the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of when you're scoping your site,
that's really what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always a risk of people kind of
finding you walking to that area or people
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying that site.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you manage security and
camouflaging the area, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keeping the area camouflaged so people
aren't able to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think there's a few things that
are sort of crucial for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, sort of have a site where your
entrance and exit are different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if someone follows you, they're not
going to see you come out of the same way
[SPEAKER_01]: you went in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always have an in and an out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two, the sort of security,
just a sort of digital security rule and a
[SPEAKER_01]: phone, that phone tracks you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're into this project, turn your
phone off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turn that location for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your biggest sort of enemy in all
of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get arrested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a wider point on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phone is dead to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get involved with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be there taking pictures,
WhatsApping your friends, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the wider point to be
made there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell no one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a private project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone you tell that's a vulnerability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your best friend, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that doesn't need to know,
doesn't need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You only expose yourself to danger.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can misjudge things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all used to misjudging things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is no different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, if you tell no one,
then there's no risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell everyone, then it's a good story.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no one else is doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes back to the whole thing because
it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's what they'd say on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one risk is the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants, once they're in the
flowering stage, they're giving off an
[SPEAKER_00]: aroma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you worry about the smell at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the smell more comes from
the cure and the dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit of growing outdoors is if
you've got a good site and it's away from
[SPEAKER_01]: the people, the smell, yes, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you've got a good site,
that's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it comes into being a problem,
maybe, is when it comes to drying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you've got a kilo of flour or a
couple of kilos of flour and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: drying, that smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose that's more of your concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all very good to get all excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then suddenly you've got it in the
bags and it's like, oh, my goodness,
[SPEAKER_01]: this smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, really, really smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think having a plan of where you're
going to dry that is far more important
[SPEAKER_01]: than worrying about the smell in the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, back in the day in the United States,
they used to have helicopters flying all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the place looking for gorilla groves
and landing, chopping down plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you deal with any of that stuff where
you live?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I suppose what I do is not that
common.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's thousands of people
out there doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the key is subtlety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy the plants that are guaranteed
like three meters tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go small and plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't clear all the undergrowth of the
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do it in a way that blends in.
[SPEAKER_01]: A medicinal plant and stinging nettles
look very similar from a distance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't clear it out,
if you've got a clearing where it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: obvious, then yeah, sure, a drone or
helicopter will see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's in amongst the other plants,
it looks like stinging nettles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of a green mass, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it seems nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get deeper into actually growing
the plants in the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, do you grow auto flowers
or photo period?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you start the plants indoors
and then bring them outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's your process there?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, I've got a little LED grow
light that I put over a truck and I'll do
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe six plants at a time and I'll do
them in batches and we'll go from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a mix of auto and photo seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's sort of having that ying and
the yang.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think autos are great, but you just
don't get the same yield as you get off a
[SPEAKER_01]: photo period seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's nice to make sure both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with hardening off and you
want to put them out, you want to give
[SPEAKER_01]: them that chance to sort of get a bit
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think generally with all of this,
because you've got that period of time,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gives you that opportunity to do a bit
more of that training, a bit more of that
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulating the plant, particularly with
the photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas autos, you're sort of in and boom,
it's three months or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long do I have that long?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of nice to have a ying and
the yang on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you vegging them indoors
before you actually bring them to your
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor location?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say at least until you've got
three tiers of plant high, but that would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be about a month to six weeks
before we take them out into the grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think what's interesting is that as
long as you get them in really before
[SPEAKER_01]: August, they all become pretty similar
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that idea of May the 4th being
the day where if you want the big ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I planted stuff end of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been as big as the ones I put in
in the beginning of May.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those sort of key months of sort
of June, July, August, really what makes
[SPEAKER_01]: the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you bring out soil and use
containers so they're grown in containers
[SPEAKER_00]: or are you taking the plants and then
planting them directly in the ground at
[SPEAKER_00]: the spot that you chose?
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out when I started doing this,
I was sort of like, yeah, containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Above ground, let's sort of own the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, as I've gone on, I've gone in
the ground and there's several reasons for
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fine, you've got to contain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to find out amount of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're putting all the micro risers
in there and you're sort of doing that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole organic, let's have a living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you need a quite a big container
for that to be a sustainable amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for that set, for you not to
have to keep having the sort of microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, embrace that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing it outdoors, embrace the
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get involved, you know, get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, there's so much to be had
from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're at the mercy of the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started out doing sort of raised
things, but I found there was two factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, they dry out much quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And number two, actually, you don't gain
any of the benefit of having the wild,
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in your growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of this sort of thing plonked
in the middle of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas actually, when you put it in the
ground, suddenly you're tapped into the
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're tapped into the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of the, you know, you're part
of nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that gives you loads of
benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's very rare to see plants in
nature that is overwhelmed by spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: and other sort of pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you get in there and get
involved in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a healthy plant, actually,
you're not worrying about the pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't all these things coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I frequently look at my
plants and there's lovely spiders and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're eating all sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they sort of entreat it as much as
they do every other plant within that
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sort of tapped into that,
both in the root system and both in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of the sort of bugs that are eating the
other bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many trips do you actually take to
that location then?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're going to think equipment,
nutrients, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you go on like back and forth
to that location?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for me, just sort of looking at
how frequently you go, it partly depends
[SPEAKER_01]: on how many plants you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of want to speak to a little
bit to that is, you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, look at your, I suppose
there's a big question you've got to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that is, if I get caught, how much do I
prefer to get caught with?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's sort of a funny
question, but you know, you've got to
[SPEAKER_01]: assess the risks before you get involved
in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to do gorilla
growing, this isn't just like banging a
[SPEAKER_01]: few seeds, turn up sort of three months
later and woo-hoo, happy days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a sort of frequent visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to really work hard to get the
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no less intensive than if you're
growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that sort of sun is free doesn't
take away from the fact that, actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing the training, you're doing
all the other bits and bobs, it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of the numbers, what are you
prepared to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you want at least once a week
visit, and then you want to bring your,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, the only thing I bring is
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't bring water.
[SPEAKER_01]: God will do that with the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just purely nutrients you bring.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's how many plants and how
prepared to do that frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more plants you have, the more trips
you've got to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose that's, and also how much of a
risk you're prepared to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're prepared to run 20 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're prepared to run six plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look at your local guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be guidelines of what is
acceptable, is personal, if it's illegal,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's considered commercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose it comes down to what do you
prefer?
[SPEAKER_01]: What risks you prefer to take?
[SPEAKER_01]: What yield are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in my country, it's probably six
plants is considered personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't do more than six in any one
site, but I may run several sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose that's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the effort you've had to put in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this season, I'm probably getting
at least half a gram for every liter of
[SPEAKER_01]: water I put in, a liter of feed I put in,
which is a pretty good return on
[SPEAKER_01]: investment in some respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to ask you how often you
go to water the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you bring up a good point,
you're growing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were in containers,
they wouldn't have access to as much water
[SPEAKER_00]: as in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're tapping into that sort of micro
riser sort of scenario, you want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe tap into the woodland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows what that lovely sort of thing
that brings to your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's stuff you can't conceive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of, you're putting it out there
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's amazing sort of how much of a
difference that makes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started out growing in pots and actually
put it in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, wow, there's a sort of
depth to this that is just a bit special.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the microbes alone, I mean,
the diversity of microbes in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: that's there in the ground is way more
than anything you're going to get out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, it's no surprise that you're
seeing a better result planting in ground.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sort of feel, you know, it's sort of
where it should be and just sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: embrace the environment you're in and just
sort of love it for what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fertilizer, that's one thing where I
want to get a little bit deeper into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about what you, I know you said
before we started recording this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you talked about how you're fully organic,
100% organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to say before we get deep
into it, thank you for being organic
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors, because there are so many issues
with people using synthetic fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: over fertilizing and runoffs happening
into our lakes and streams, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: causing toxic algae brooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge issue around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you going the organic route,
you're helping with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, thank you for not
contributing to the pollution of our lakes
[SPEAKER_00]: and streams.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's like you're out there,
you work with it on against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, also organic is just,
there's no reason not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many amazing products out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, Biobuzz is the one I go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a Dutch company, they do amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use the fish mix, which, geez,
those plants love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you're growing indoors,
that's probably a bit smelly, but it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do the bloom and I do the Tomax that
they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those sort of three things,
the thing I like about them is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: just pH-balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't bother having to worry about
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty much everything you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go with a few other supplements because,
do I need them really or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but I mean, probably the
Biobuzz does it all, but we're busy
[SPEAKER_01]: gardeners and we like to fiddle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's another product that I use that
is like an EcoThrive and it's an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll break it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it comes to the whole,
I'll dig compost in and then I'll add some
[SPEAKER_01]: bone meal and I'll add some baguano and
I'll add some fish and blood mix into
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a sort of base layer for the plant to
sort of tuck into when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be a bit careful about baguano because
you can burn the plants if you put too
[SPEAKER_01]: much in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get the yellow tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll top dress later with some of
those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EcoThrive stuff is amazing and that's
got all your gypsum, that's got your
[SPEAKER_01]: insect frass, that's got all those sort of
lovely things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And baguano just, I find, really makes the
flowers taste amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a combination of both of those
that sort of I go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's feeding the microbes
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you're trying to do that on
several levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of that gives your plant sort of
the best sort of mix of those two things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of the stuff in the soil is when
it needs it and the stuff you're watering
[SPEAKER_01]: regularly is sort of, hopefully is sort of
topping up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do an initial amending of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are slow release.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them it sounds like are slow
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to break down over time
and last you throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're also doing a feeding with
BioBuzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break down your BioBuzz feeding a
little bit deeper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, I think you said once a week
you're doing a feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you following the ratios on the actual
feeding chart?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm totally feeding into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they say is what I'm sort of mixing
in terms of those ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people say, do half what they
say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I'm going full on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just following what they say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm following their feed mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I find that that's working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing very little yellow tipping on
my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not seeing any sort of curling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel they've nailed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a very good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a fantastic company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that fish stuff, man, the plants
absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a gorilla, you're not seeing them every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you go once, twice a week and you're
like, you come back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that's grown alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a kid in a candy shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god, that's getting bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that organic matter coming in and
having the balance of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, that's a really happy
compromise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to ask, how big are these
plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you mentioned when you're
actually planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What month are you planting them and how
big are the plants actually growing to?
[SPEAKER_01]: May the 4th is the time to get the big
plants in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think you get away with June,
you've got really big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get it in in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you've probably done six weeks
before you plant it in June.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of work back from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for me, I don't choose strains
that are like the sort of nine foot plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because actually I don't want something
that's nine foot high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, I think there was a moment
where I learned about training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a time when they were like,
well, they send the hormone to the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: point in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, wow, that's canopy
management for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I know what that canopy needs to
be now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do a combination of sort of
trellis, stretching it out on the trellis
[SPEAKER_01]: and just canes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm pretty, the lovely thing about
sort of growing outdoors is you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can really get it wrong and it doesn't
really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get it wrong in June or by the time
August comes around, it's recovered.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pretty residual.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't call it, you know,
their name, they call it for nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a robust plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can really take some sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will do supercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do high stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will pinch the plant and then bend it
over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I will tie it to a cane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the principle of having everything on
a level playing field, making everything
[SPEAKER_01]: the same height, that's just until it goes
into flower, that's the one strategy you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make everything level.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it goes into flower, boom,
your top colors are abounding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was for me a real penny drop moment
when someone just said, yeah, it just
[SPEAKER_01]: sends the hormone to the highest point in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just thought, wow, everything's got to
be the highest point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you're doing supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you also do any topping?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, how often do you do the topping?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I suppose sort of topping is,
I mean, you know, doing the topping is
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly crucial to sort of getting the
maximum number of sort of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a combination of topping and
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you sort of, the more you do it,
you sort of learn that maybe is the one to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be sort of organic with how it sort of is
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of if there's particular ones
that are growing up, maybe that's the one
[SPEAKER_01]: to top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just sort of have a bit of a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose you, it's such a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each of those plants you're sort of
quite intimate with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really learn them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You learn what those plants are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sort of have that relationship with
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds ridiculous, but it is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing, oh, that bit's going well
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That bit, oh, if I crop that, it will go
ding, ding, ding to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I suppose that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that regular interaction with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking at it and just sort of
reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you do it, the more you'll
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you'll see, you'll make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's proof you're learning in some
respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being patient with it, taking your time
and doing the training, making sure all
[SPEAKER_00]: the training is done prior to it starting
to flower can certainly be super key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned you're doing
lollipopping, which let people know the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big benefits of that is to
eliminate all those larpy buds that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the bottom part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned you do lollipopping,
defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: When?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, mold outside is your
biggest worry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have that sort of canopy
that has some air blowing through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's a real danger if
you let it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, when they go into flower,
it's like this pop, pop, pop, pop,
[SPEAKER_01]: pop, pop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having just rolling back from some of
that, it doesn't need all those plant of
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take some of them out and managing
that canopy, you know, making sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just the top ones that are there,
that the energy is going to and just
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will stand above it and look down
and see, right, what it's the lights on
[SPEAKER_01]: the, on the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it blocking light on the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gone, gone, gone, gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I think you just got to be on it
frequently because it's amazing how much
[SPEAKER_01]: it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had to like lose a plant
because of like powdery mildew or have you
[SPEAKER_00]: come across bud rot or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be very lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what's interesting is if you've
got healthy plants, pests and bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't tend to go for healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got things that are a bit dodgy,
bit weak, yeah, they tend to go for that a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's, it's, you know,
and you just can be a lucky, you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: get plagued by something and it will just
take the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, you know, take off the
dead leaves, anything with any color of
[SPEAKER_01]: discoloration on remove it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important because you
can then see when you next come back,
[SPEAKER_01]: is there more of that plant with that,
you know, that's spotting on the leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is it, is it a calm egg
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it a magnesium deficiency?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what, what's coming through
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you don't remove those,
it's harder to tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd always recommend remove the dodgy
looking leaves because that will give me
[SPEAKER_01]: an indication of it's more of a problem or
it's the one-off problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the humidity is going to be
a big impact on whether or not that stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the natural temperature and
humidity at the location you grow at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, we're sort of Northern
hemisphere Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you're at the mercy of the
outdoor world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're wet, we're damp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this year has been amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was, I had girls out there until
end of November.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it was the beginning of
November.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, end of October rather,
and it's, it's a bit, it's been amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, we can't really talk about
climate change in a positive terms often,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have to say where I live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is going to change, happy profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned that you haven't really
come across many pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a lot of people do sprays that
they do as like a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing anything like that at all to
your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just letting them go and hope for
the best?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have historically done neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the sort of, you know,
them into the sprays, sprays, spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I sort of, I sort of, but in embracing
nature, let's just see what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure, if you've got pests,
the best thing you do if you've got pests
[SPEAKER_01]: is just take time to squidge them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, get on the plant, get the
between your fingers and just go the
[SPEAKER_01]: spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's spend the next two hours
squidging the spider mites on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm finding that actually within
nature that, and when he grow organic and
[SPEAKER_01]: when you grow wild, there's, there's an
abundance of pests and things to eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll look at my plants and they'll be
covered in spiders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, well, the spiders are
taking care of the things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, every pest is also an
opportunity for a predator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that sort of natural balance,
which maybe if you're in, if you're a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: space, the spider mites go in,
you're indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all over the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's nothing to really eat them
unless you buy something off the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: To eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas in the wild, you know,
it's very rare to see plants overwhelmed
[SPEAKER_01]: by pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a normal natural balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually what's been really
interesting is growing outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's spiders on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eating things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this sort of balance playing out
in front of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to deal with what mother
nature brings you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and if it comes big with
the spider mite, then I'm not,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a verse to treating that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my experience, I found that healthy
plants tend not to have that much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe that's sort of, yeah,
could be a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe next year I'll be like,
absolutely out there with aneme oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other things trying to kill it
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm unlucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you plant in May or June, typically,
what months are you harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I tend to plant a sort of
variation of sort of auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: semi autos and sort of photo period
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you sort of want to have, you know,
as much coming through the seasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: different crops and different harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, this year has been amazing and
I've been able to push stuff to sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do an initial crop and then I'll
leave it two weeks for the second flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to sort of let the plant recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but really we're talking sort of mid
September, if it's not an auto,
[SPEAKER_01]: but auto, you know, you're just sort of
counting the calendars in some extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how big are the plants when you
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm wondering how you're getting
these plants out of the location.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to imagine that that could be
difficult if you have a huge plant on your
[SPEAKER_00]: back and you're trying to get it out of
the location.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best recommendation would be buy
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the the bags that you can buy in
the grocery store that you put your
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're reusable and they're just the
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: These little bags and they're great for
plants because if it's a bit wet,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that air coming through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these little sort of cloth sacks with
the sort of, yeah, I'd recommend those for
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of managing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually when it comes down to it and
you're managing that sort of numbers of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, it gets quite big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're into rucksacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think taking them out,
camera bags are great because they have
[SPEAKER_01]: that sort of rigid structure and you can
put the little plants in and I take camera
[SPEAKER_01]: bags are great for taking those sort of
plants out to the site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bringing them back, the webs
bags, I'd really recommend those.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fantastic for taking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, yeah, it's rucksack after
rucksack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will do a initial crop and then I'll
do two weeks later, I'll do the second
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then maybe a third, depending on how
many little bags there are that need a few
[SPEAKER_01]: more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really tailored to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to be in touch with your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're sort of, at that stage,
they're friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're old friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been in the ground for so many
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sort of quite intimate with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're watching every bit of them growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're training them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're manipulating them to get the
absolutely best out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, by the time you come to
crop, you know which flowers you're taking
[SPEAKER_01]: first, which ones you're leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, it's having that just
attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so you're doing like a, I want to
say scattered harvest, but that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really the right way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're harvesting like one plant at a
time, kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you can be able to carry it
out or you harvest them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, I won't do them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll do them basically when
they're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be playing close attention with the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be looking at when those plants are
sort of starting to get a bit amber on the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes and just try and tailor it to
the perfect time for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's ultimately what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, there's limitations to sort of
how much I can dry in my dry space in only
[SPEAKER_01]: one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this sort of, that is a factor
within the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think people are going to remember
that basically when the best of us ever
[SPEAKER_01]: get given is like, when you think it's
time to crop, wait three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you think it's the moment and
you're sort of willing it on because
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like, obviously always game for the
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're sort of, you're there and
you'll look at it and you'll think,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it's the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, it's a three week window.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can crop a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no now's got to be the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There isn't the perfect time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a window within which you'll
guarantee that it will be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can get, yeah,
it's that whole snake oil, the bro signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these things about sort of
growing where they, it has to be this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta be that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't do that, you'll miss,
it's, you know, there's a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also just the reality,
it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll still get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So happy days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you chop down your plant and
you're bringing it back home or wherever
[SPEAKER_00]: you're bringing it, drying and curing,
let's get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do for drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are your conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is your drying area set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I bought a product this year
thinking, oh yeah, you know, the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: dryer, you know, online, it's got a carbon
filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, it doesn't solve the smell,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it's got a carbon filter,
it's still absolutely honks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, having a,
I think, and I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can be a gorilla grown, you can live
in a flat and you don't have the space to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and gorilla growing seems like the
best solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my warning to you is yes,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow a kilo of weed in the wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one will find you, but you know,
bring that back to your flat in some city
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhere, you know, have a plan for
drying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when medicinal plants are drying,
it's very smelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The smell is quite prominent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a plan for those two weeks where it
goes from, you know, woohoo, I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: loads of it to, oh my goodness,
what the hell am I going to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope no one notices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it comes back to that
vulnerability because all this stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: all this illegal, you're vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be from your partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be from your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be from any number of sources
that makes you vulnerable, whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: want to manipulate you, call the police,
get one over on you, any of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't underestimate how
vulnerable you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be the big dude, the whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells strongly.
[SPEAKER_01]: People recognize that smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there may be problems and things
escalate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think they will, but you know,
it can be a landowner deciding to detain
[SPEAKER_01]: you and calling the cops.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be your landlord, you know,
coming for a flat and expense inspection
[SPEAKER_01]: and just blocking what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, all these things, it can unravel
really quickly, which is why I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're thinking about doing this and
it's really easy to get down the rabbit
[SPEAKER_01]: hole and it's amazing and so much fun and
it's so many good, positive things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing for your mental health.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all those good things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't recommend it highly enough,
but have an understanding of consequence
[SPEAKER_01]: and just have an exit plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if it goes wrong and your
neighbor complains about the smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: have a friend that says, yeah,
I've got a garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put it in, you know, have an exit
strategy because there's nothing more
[SPEAKER_01]: stressful than spending nine months
producing the most amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just like you're trapped between
a partner saying, make it disappear and
[SPEAKER_01]: your neighbor going, I can smell medicinal
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, what are your options?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have an exit plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a plan B.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't over-incise that enough because
there's nothing worse than having to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that disappear in a way that you don't get
to benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, doing this stuff,
it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, really does.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a commitment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're sort of in with the thing and
it's an amazing thing to do, but just at
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of your mind, have those things
mapped out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just go into it all sort of sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go, oh, it'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it won't be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to work it out because when
they're saying there's a problem,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got to have a plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way to conserve the terpenes,
obviously the smell coming off the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is the terpenes volatizing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's evaporating into the air and that's
what you're smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: To conserve those terpenes, lowering the
temp in your drive room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think you mentioned what
temperature you usually aim for in a drive
[SPEAKER_00]: room or humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, my control over that is sort of
limited just because of where it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's probably between 16 to 18 degrees
is normally what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably takes me sort of 10 days,
two weeks for it to dry to a point where
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the first year I've really
gone for the growth, but I have to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, wow, amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like it's been transformative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in the mason jars and the burping
and the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness, what a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you get to sort of an outdoor grow
where you've caught a sort of considerable
[SPEAKER_01]: quantity or it's not like a sort of few
ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, you know, you're into sort of
40 ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're a kilo.
[SPEAKER_01]: You quite quickly get to the point where
you're like, you need to manage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot to manage and it can go
wrong very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mold goes really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think I would say with outdoor
growing, you know, mold is your big enemy,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just accept it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've just got to plant more twice what
you think you want and assume that hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll lose half the mold and you'll be
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it comes and nothing goes in a jar
without being looked at through a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very tight, through a loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm there like literally every bud and
it's easy to spot the mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, but just accept it's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has been amazing, but,
you know, to once the end of the harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you go for that second crop and it's
sort of late October, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you may lose half bits of mold,
but, you know, just be on it and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: just don't ignore it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no going away from it and just
manage it as best you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went through your whole process
there, what you do when you're gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from preparing the site for
planting, identifying a place to plant all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way through planting, fertilizer,
watering, all the way to harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely an interesting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly an indoor grower, but I do have
outdoor gardening experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, there are some things that
relate to indoors, but there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: differences growing outdoors and I
appreciate you coming on and sharing what
[SPEAKER_00]: you do here on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want to be discreet here,
so there's not going to be a any social
[SPEAKER_00]: media links down below or anything like
usual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm showing you around my garden and all
that stuff, but unfortunately the way the
[SPEAKER_01]: law is now, I mean, you know, I think
amazing America has done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Germans are about to do it,
but you know, we saw how road versus way
[SPEAKER_01]: went the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be too confident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's not a fleeting flash in the
pan and I hope it's the start of the thin
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the edge that changes everything
because I think the world will be better
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, but it's nice to be involved in
your forecast and hopefully I inspire some
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know, because I think there's
a lot of people out there that can't do a
[SPEAKER_01]: four by four tent, even if it is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a lot of people out
there who just have partners, family that
[SPEAKER_01]: just would never accept them doing that,
even if it is legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think gorilla growing offers an
opportunity to get out there, to do
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of, it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that rock and roll element of sort
of, yeah, it enables you to have a project
[SPEAKER_01]: go out there and it can be thrilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be really just exhilarating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's really good for your
mental health to have that secret garden
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to be out there and go just
with my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's good for your soul.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, consider it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, I think the industry is full
of sort of snake oil and all of that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, but when it comes down to it,
you know, you can do some really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't, it's not about money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go and buy the pound store
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy the pound store or the dollar
store sort of bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to spend lots of money on
sort of high-end stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, ultimately spend the money on
the genetics, get those seeds right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the bit to spend the money on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately you will go and do,
it will do, if you spend a bit more money,
[SPEAKER_01]: but ultimately if you do enough of that,
it will, it will give you something and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will reward you and it will make your soul
feel richer and your life will be better
[SPEAKER_01]: for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, don't be too paranoid in
late September, October time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are some great final words.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks Mr. Poodle420 for
coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely appreciate your time today
and I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
