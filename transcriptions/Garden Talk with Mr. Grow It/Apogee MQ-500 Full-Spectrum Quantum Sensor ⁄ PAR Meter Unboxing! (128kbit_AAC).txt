[SPEAKER_00]: What is up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Mr. Growip.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'm going to unbox the
Apogee MQ-500 quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growing cannabis, this quantum
sensor, or often referred to as PAR meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: is used to measure photon density.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the amount of PAR, or
photosynthetic active radiation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the energy that plants use to
photosynthesis, that's being emitted from
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This sensor picks up all light in the 400
to 700 nanometer range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's get into the unboxing.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shipping box, and as you can
see when opening, it's packed nicely with
[SPEAKER_00]: some bubble wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a small piece of paper in there
which thanks me for ordering and tells me
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to the website for additional
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quantum sensor comes in this carrying
case, and then when I open the case it's
[SPEAKER_00]: completely padded for protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a two meter cable,
and I'm just pulling off the plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: material right now, and the cord comes
zip-tied as well, so I had to cut that
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a cap on top of the actual sensor
for protection, and I bought the wand as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was an additional cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not come with the MQ-500.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wand extends to 84 centimeters,
and you can just pull it out, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how it extends, so no release button or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a few Velcro pieces,
and then lastly it comes with a battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: This battery will of course need to be put
into the sensor before operating,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll do that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: First I'm going to attach the wand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to unscrew the screw that's in the
bottom of the sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and now I'll attach the top of the wand to
the sensor, and then screw the screw back
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next I'll remove the backplate and add in
the battery, and the battery just slides
[SPEAKER_00]: right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after I reattach the backplate,
the quantum sensor is ready to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since this sensor doesn't come with an
instruction manual, I highly recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that you watch the instructional video
that Apogee created.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link to that video in the
description section below, along with a
[SPEAKER_00]: link to the MQ-500 quantum sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
