[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast where
we interview growers from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for those of you that
don't know me, my name is Chris,
[SPEAKER_00]: aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned in to
the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
[SPEAKER_00]: number 149.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Paul from Wake
and Bake with Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a Syngannic gardener who grows in
his garage, which brings its own unique
[SPEAKER_00]: set of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets into detail on the way he does it
successfully, everything from equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: setup, balancing the environment's
conditions, preventing pests, and so much
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode, who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back, and I'm joined with Paul
from Wake and Bake with Paul.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pleasure being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk all about
growing plants in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like this is something that a
decent amount of people do, grow in a
[SPEAKER_00]: garage, because they can't within their
house for whatever reason, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they don't have space in their house
or whatever, but it's really a topic that
[SPEAKER_00]: we haven't gotten into much in any of
these podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing in a garage really comes with its
own unique set of challenges, which we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like even if you don't grow in a
garage, there will still be some takeaways
[SPEAKER_00]: in this episode, so don't go anywhere if
you see the topic and want to run here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, my name's Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a mid-40s guy out here in Southern
California, Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been married for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my anniversary was two weeks
ago, so congrats to my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: She stuck around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four kids, and I've been a garage grower
for the past four plus years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up a farmer's kid, so I spent a lot
of time in the fields when I was young up
[SPEAKER_01]: towards early adult, but my father had a
vineyard and an almond farm, so I spent a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of time out in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was introduced to farming, gardening at
a young age, and a lot of that translated
[SPEAKER_01]: into what you see behind me as the garage
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then another question I like to ask in the
beginning is, what's your grow style?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're indoors in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in soil, cocoa, hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using organic or synthetic inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three grow tents in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a farmer's kid, so I reverted to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I'm comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's the common phrase these days
is synganic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give the plants synthetic
nutrients, but I also like to add worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, and I also like to feed in
molasses from time to time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've helped the root zone, so I guess
that's what you would call synganic.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get deeper into nutrients,
how you use them, what you use throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole grow cycle later on in the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I do want to dive into you
explaining your garden setup that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you already mentioned you have three
grow tents in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have for lighting and how do
you do ventilation and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Explain your grow setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one to my side this way, this is a AC
Infinity 3x3.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the complete setup with the
controller, which hands down, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to use the word boring,
but it really helps regulate so much of
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment that it becomes almost
hands off.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one behind me is a competitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to name any names,
but at some point I want to upgrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light is pretty good, but I've really
never been a fan of their tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Truthfully, in their customer service,
one time they told me to sew something on
[SPEAKER_01]: a defect, and I was just shocked,
but thankfully, AC Infinity is not like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've got one over here on the side
that's a bit of a reject tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I picked up as something I needed,
but the light in there I have,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the Green Sunshine Company,
the Electric Sky 180 D3, which I still
[SPEAKER_01]: love that light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it works great, so it's hard to
part ways with that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might upgrade the tent and the
ventilation, but I still want to use that
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ventilation, I've got fans inside there,
lots of air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got an intake fan for all of them,
as well as an exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of air circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some things I do to just make sure
that I keep things clean as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the setup I have right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a variety of companies when it
comes to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last one, the one behind me,
it's all competitor stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got three different tents there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing perpetual grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that why you have three different
tents, or is it just so you can grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain number of plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the reason for the three different
tents?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a perpetual grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of have different plants in
different life cycles, so there's always a
[SPEAKER_01]: surplus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to kind of keep things going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, I like to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the right amount of plants in one
tent or something like that is just...
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening's fun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to play games, you want to try
different things, and you want to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just all-in-one, it kind of makes
it a little bit boring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like to one, the perpetual grow,
but also kind of diversify and just kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of do different things at different times
with different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you on a strict schedule for your
perpetual grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Perpetual to where you're like,
okay, I'm going to do this number of weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'm going to flip that to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got everything kind of rotating
evenly, or you just kind of wing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: My jars are full.
[SPEAKER_01]: To simply put it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got plenty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the three by three,
it has one plant in it, and it's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: solo cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the global grow cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I devoted that entire plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That entire setup to that bonsai tree of a
plant that's sitting in there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's got a good amount of clones,
and then the one over there in the corner,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a Gary Payton that's kind of later
stages of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in a Scrock, so it takes up the
entire tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your grow tents where your plants are
growing, what environment conditions do
[SPEAKER_00]: you typically aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess with that, you've got your
optimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: My basis typically, I go off of VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not strictly, but once you kind of get an
understanding of the variations that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for, you know where your
relative humidity needs to be in contrast
[SPEAKER_01]: to the heat in the... Well, I'm in SoCal,
so the heat typically in the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's optimum conditions, and I think
there's realistic conditions, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: there's getting by conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, actually, when we met,
when you were here in Southern California,
[SPEAKER_01]: that couple of weeks was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply put, the weather was just horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm in my garage, and it's 10 PM,
and it's like 95 degrees outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're just thinking like,
oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, at the end of the day,
the plants are really resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you go for the tent,
and it's hot in there, and the humidity is
[SPEAKER_01]: low, and the plants are praying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just loving life, and you're like,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You tough little critters.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are doing pretty good,
but I like to be... Again, I base off of
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the important things is
just to make sure that you've got a good
[SPEAKER_01]: function humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just so you're kind of always
keeping that up, because in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences, when it's really hot,
if you can increase the humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: it decreases the general temperature in
the environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, one of the ideas that I had
sent AC Infinity, because I do the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in the tent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do it from seedling all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I use a dome for the seedling,
but when there are little dinks to where
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm harvesting and cutting down,
it's all in the grow tent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the wishlist items that I had
sent AC Infinity was, hey, it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: great if on the automation, there was a
notifier that when your humidity is low,
[SPEAKER_01]: the water in the humidifier is low,
so it tells you, hey, go fill it up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you never want to run out,
if you're drying or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a dry environment, you don't want to
run out of water in the humidifier,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another one that will tell me when
it's empty, but that's typically too late.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a warning sign would be magnificent,
but that's the environment I'm typically
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the colder months, it's usually 50s
to 70s in the garage, hotter months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be 70s to 90s in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically in the tent, it's a little
bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've got some things that I use,
such as what's really important to me is
[SPEAKER_01]: an external AC unit that actually also has
a dehumidifier in it as a means of being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to push in colder air when I need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a method of doing that as well,
but it's important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll talk about it later,
but I mean, if you're going to invest and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in a warm climate, it's something
you need, especially if you're going in
[SPEAKER_01]: the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to be able to come back to heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you mentioned you track after VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you happen to know like for KPA,
do you measure by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you kind of have it in mind like,
okay, for this stage of growth,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to aim for this KPA,
veg, flour, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have those numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're just looking at a chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, you know, there's some convenient
things that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's an app on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it's called a VPD calculator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you punch in, you know,
the temperature and then you also punch in
[SPEAKER_01]: the relative humidity and it kind of tells
you where you are as far as, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's either humid, it'll tell you if
it's dry stress or it'll tell you if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: an, you know, in optimum flowering
conditions or if it's an optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetative condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of get used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, typically it's like a 15
point difference between the temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and the humidity for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for veg is typically about like
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's 80 degrees in the tent,
you're probably looking at like 72%
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity and that'll kind of put
you in a good spot for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm no pro and I'm no scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of go off of, you know,
experience, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of know what temperature,
if it's at this temperature, I should
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be at this humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then at the same time,
you have built-in trust with the automatic
[SPEAKER_01]: automation and controls, you know,
so they're doing their job too,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I'm in seedling and veg,
I'm usually aiming for like a 0.8 to 1.1
[SPEAKER_00]: KPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for flour, just like typically
about 1.2 to 1.5, sometimes upwards of 1.6
[SPEAKER_00]: KPA.
[SPEAKER_00]: But according to the pulse VPD charts,
that's kind of the optimal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, a lot of people think
that they need to just be in that range
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're outside of it, they're screwed,
which really isn't the case, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the plants will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just might not be that optimal growth
according to VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I totally get what you mean by like
having the experience and knowing,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I'm at 82 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I need to be between this and this
percent relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of get that feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people that are just using
temperature and humidity, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: really are falling within that optimal VPD
range without even knowing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I just figured I'd throw that one
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at the same time, you see plants
outside, you know, you have plants outside
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's 110 degrees outside and the
relative humidity is 27 degrees or
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, I should say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants are all doing just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, again, there's optimum
conditions and there's realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really try to fall into the
realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you just can't get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just too hot out or if it's,
you know, if it's just too cool,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's too dry, you can combat that with
the humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like you said, most people
just, it falls within the range of
[SPEAKER_01]: acceptable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant's going to be, it's dealing with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you kind of think maybe the
stress is up in the plant with its
[SPEAKER_01]: trichrome production and some of that
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of it being a perfect lifestyle
for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's inside your grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about your lung room or really
the room that your grow tents are in,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you aiming for a certain temperature
and humidity in your garage so that way
[SPEAKER_00]: any air coming into your grow tents are of
the proper temp and RH or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my, my lung room is my man cave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So behind me is my kind of my grow area
over here to my side is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a kind of a bench with a laptop,
you know, my whole, you know, when I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working from home, that's where I'm
working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in front of me is my TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm watching you guys on your
podcast, you know, you want your podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: or some of these other guys, it's all
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically my garage is open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hanging out in here and I'm,
and I'm, you know, again, I'm in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically the weather's pretty nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your hot time and you've got
your cool time, but we don't get the four
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons like some of these other places
where people are growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's oftentimes tolerable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's too hot out, the garage is closed
and I'm hanging out inside a closed
[SPEAKER_01]: garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just right, you know, the garage
is open and you know, again, there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of things that I do, you know,
whether it's, you know, using the external
[SPEAKER_01]: AC unit, if I need to, to help push in
cold air, if it's really hot out,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if the garage is closed and it's
still hot out, I, you know, I'll hook up
[SPEAKER_01]: ducting from the AC unit, straight from
the AC unit to where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of opens up like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll shove the ducting and I'll shove it
in there and I'll tape it on there so it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't fall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll run that duct hose straight
into the intake fan of my, of the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just pushing cold air right into
there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to make sure to filter on
your external AC and it's always clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pushing, you know, cleaner air.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, if, if you're looking for a
way to decrease the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the internal temperature of your grow tent
versus outside by up to 15, 20 degrees,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just pushing in cold air,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fortunate my garage actually has a
spot that's got a external, like a kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: a, where air can exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've actually taped the exhaust from
the AC unit straight there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pushing all that hot air right out
of my garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can run the AC unit with my garage
closed and it's ventilating the hot air
[SPEAKER_01]: out and it's pushing the cool air right
into my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, depending on the climate
you're at, you know, you're in Vegas in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of the people out in Vegas growing
in their garage, you need an AC unit in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, you know, or else it's,
it gets, it gets hot in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becomes a scorcher, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to have something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants will be happy, but come on,
you know, make their lives a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my lung room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a couple of buddies who grow in
the garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm based in Las Vegas, the desert and
summertime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from June, July, August, just about
every day is over a hundred degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit, which I did a conversion here
because I didn't want to leave out the
[SPEAKER_00]: folks that's using Celsius, but over 37
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's pretty hot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes it reaches up to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddies that are growing in the
garage out here, they have, like you said,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have an air conditioner literally
right in their garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're cooling that air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the flip side, when you're in the
winter time, it gets very cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they actually have to heat the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to use a heater at all in the
winter time to kind of heat up your
[SPEAKER_00]: garage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth space inside your grow
tents, for example, doesn't get too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I get inventive, you know,
with the AC unit, you know, I I'll shove,
[SPEAKER_01]: cause I've got the three tents,
I'll shove three duct hoses and kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: the line like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just running to all three tents
simultaneously, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a three in one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for, you know, I've got like a floor,
like a space heater, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those, you know, just $50 space heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've actually, I grabbed a tote and I
kind of enclosed it in the tote standing
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran the three duct hoses in there,
kind of trapping the heat in that area as
[SPEAKER_01]: best as I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the intake fan was just sucking in warm
air from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that proved to be
successful as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're, you know, again,
if you, you know, if you've got multiple
[SPEAKER_01]: tents in this, you want to buy three space
heaters and throw them each one in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent, which sometimes is too strong and it
gets too warm in there because it's right
[SPEAKER_01]: on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're running the intake fan,
oftentimes it's got the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the adjuster on it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's pulling too much or too little,
you can adjust that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've, you know, I've used a big tote
that I got from Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the, you know, kind of kneaded against
the space heater against the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had the three duct hoses going
in there and just sucking the hot air
[SPEAKER_01]: right from that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helped warm the entire,
you know, I might be cold where I'm at
[SPEAKER_01]: because I want the heater on me,
but my tents are thriving with the right
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that external help, in my opinion,
is really important if you're in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garage, whether it's that outside AC unit
that's going to help cool the tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also the dehumidifier, which is
fantastic when it comes to drying,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, and also just a quality space heater
that you could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got one tent, you could either kind
of hose it in or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not big on putting the heater right in
the tent, depending on how much room
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got, especially if it's going to be
right next to one of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of like it to come from the
general, the intake fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a fan of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting way to go about it,
having it docked directly into the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tents, the way that you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different ways to go about it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you could just do it passively and
just grab what's coming in from your
[SPEAKER_00]: garage, for example, but that might not be
as good as the way that you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a follow up question I have for you
is, do you also have the rectangle intake
[SPEAKER_00]: vents open as well, or you only have the
hoses hooked up to the ventilation socks?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have them open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, if, if I, you know, if, if I don't,
if the weather's perfect, the intake fan
[SPEAKER_01]: is just kind of sitting on top of the
tent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that I do to kind
of, you know, I like to cover it with
[SPEAKER_01]: panty hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the intake fan, if it's sitting there
by itself, I'll cover it with panty hose
[SPEAKER_01]: as a, as a really good method to kind of
filter out stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it'd kind of blow your mind
because if you kind of, if you clean it
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly, you, you know, spack it against
like, you know, something, you'll just,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of filth that just bounces out
of there is disturbing, but at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time kind of refreshing because you're
like, wow, this would have all gotten
[SPEAKER_01]: sucked right into the grow tent and just
been part of that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's why I was saying clean the
filter on the AC unit if you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: duct it that way, because you just,
you're trying to make sure that anything
[SPEAKER_01]: going in your tent is, yes, as filtered as
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not using, you know,
the, like a carbon filter or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that as an intake, to like kind of
bring in cleaner that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people these days kind of use the
carbon filter to, to kind of kill the
[SPEAKER_01]: smell, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's usually the exhaust that it's
connected to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good tips.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we spent a long time here on just
the environment conditions and I balance
[SPEAKER_00]: them and stuff like that, but I feel like
it's kind of an important thing to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about when you're growing in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just, it's so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be so different or it can be
similar to growing inside of a house,
[SPEAKER_00]: but for most people, I feel like it's a,
it's got its own unique challenges when it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes to environment, but let's move on to
other parts of the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some basics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically use for like
container size and type?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you mentioned you're in soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's in your mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: So containers, um, well, when I'm,
when they're seedlings, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I kind of like to use clear solo
cups that I put inside of a colored solo
[SPEAKER_01]: cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because it, you know, it helps you
kind of look at the roots, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of know what's going on down
there and it's a, it's a really kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: cool cheat code, um, when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I start off in a, in a solo cup,
clear in a colored one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if I'm, if I'm going straight
into the, the final resting place,
[SPEAKER_01]: the home that it's going to be in,
I'll go into a, a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if I'm going to transfer up to it,
I'll, I'll go from plastic into,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the final one is, uh,
as a fabric one, just because
[SPEAKER_01]: transplanting is a heck of a lot easier
pulling it out of a plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pot versus a, a fabric one, because those
roots like to kind of dig into the fabric
[SPEAKER_01]: ones, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it could be kind of chaotic to get
them out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, as far as a mix, um, soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to use, typically my mix is like
one third happy frog from Fox farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, two thirds,
uh, ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then within that, I like to,
to add, uh, worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I used to add perlite,
but I feel like Fox farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, has enough in there to, you know,
air rates just fine, I think in my
[SPEAKER_01]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I used to add perlite, but I don't do
that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just really, it's one third happy
frog, two thirds, ocean forest,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, some, uh, worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And did you mention, uh, I think I'm going
to miss what container size those fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: pots are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I'm kind of doing a simple,
like a phenol hunt or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw them into two, you know,
two gallon pots, just so, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of maximize the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but typically I kind of stick to the
three to five range, uh, depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, you know, uh, how big I'm really
trying to get them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're an attempt, they're going to
get so big, you know, you don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, in my opinion, you don't really
need to get bigger than a five gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, unless you're trying to grow a
monster in a five by five or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think three to three
gallons is, is convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five gallons is convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was actually asking myself the other
day, I'm like, I wonder why they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: make four gallon because they make one,
two, three and five, but they don't make
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four, which could be even convenient too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, I'm usually between three and
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd probably buy a four.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just me though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's organic growing up, it's the
same as you either a three gallon or five
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I like to just be in the five
because well, for mostly just for like
[SPEAKER_00]: watering purposes, if I'm hand watering,
you know, the five gallon is going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: to be watered a little bit less than the
three gallon, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only reason why I would really
choose a five over three when I'm organic
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned your mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Third, happy frog, two thirds,
ocean forest, and then some worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, eventually those nutrients are going
to deplete and you're going to need to add
[SPEAKER_00]: in some more nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you typically start your first
feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, if you could walk us
through kind of the remaining life cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you do your feedings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, it depends on how the plant
digger, when I kind of, when I start,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if they're thriving and they're
growing, probably, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, after I've transplanted,
them from like the solo cup into a bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, home, I guess you can say,
I'd say probably three weeks, something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think the nutrients in the
soil, they, they last a pretty good amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically about three weeks,
two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not heavy on, on the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't try to kind of push too much on
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it, you know, in my past, what I give
has shown me success.
[SPEAKER_01]: So probably about, you know, two to three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as what I, did you ask what I give?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do I use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for nutrient lineup?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a, I'm a kind of a creature of
habit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started, you know,
a lot of the information I got was from a,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a friend of mine that was going at
home out in central California,
[SPEAKER_01]: more on a grander scale for businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he introduced me to a company called
Veg Plus Bloom, Bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they have a part A and a
part B.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a foliar spray as well as
something they call life, which is their,
[SPEAKER_01]: their version of the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've been, you know, I've been using
them for, for, since I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I, I do add some,
you know, some bloom additives and such
[SPEAKER_01]: during flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, when they're seedlings,
I typically give them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: RO water with some seaweed extract kind of
helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it helps to kind of just helps get
them started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as far as like root development,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I, once they're in veg,
you know, typically if I'm looking at PPM,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's right around like the 500 range
with the, with the part A that I give.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I give molasses, that usually
helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to PPM, I think skyrocket if I'm
not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: But during veg, I just, I just give the
part A, you know, I add, I add some CalMac
[SPEAKER_01]: here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to add silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it helps with,
with just making the, the plant just more
[SPEAKER_01]: sturdy as far as branches and just being
able to, you know, carry some weight later
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to add silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then once I've kind of gotten into
flower, you know, you, you add these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you keep everything that I had before,
you know, I, I include, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to include, you know,
microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some microbial inoculant, inoculant as
well to kind of just make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: root zone is active and, you know,
breaking down certain things and giving
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant the opportunity to uptake the
nutrients that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's when I add the, the flowering
part of veg plus bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also like to add some bloom
boosters just to kind of help stack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always convinced that those things are
working or the brands that I'm using are
[SPEAKER_01]: the best when it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm kind of looking at, again,
it's tough for me to make changes when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to the nutrient lines, because,
you know, what I've used is showing me
[SPEAKER_01]: success, but I don't know if I can get
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of have that in the back of
your mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've got, I've got this,
which was sent to me and I've got to work
[SPEAKER_01]: that into my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I've got this mental block when
it comes to switching up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, come on, Paul, you got from the
stash, man, they sent it to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of, I got to work it into my
regimen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just funny how people become,
you know, I like to experiment on one end
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to like plant training and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on one, when it comes to like the
nutrients that I give, I'm just,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, to the point where,
you know, I don't measure PPM anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know this is what I give my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I measured it in the past,
like, like a rocket scientist,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you're writing down exactly what
you're giving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I, I used to even measure
the PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, I'd add Cal Mag and then I'd add,
you know, that nutrient and then I'd mix
[SPEAKER_01]: it up and then I check the PPM and then
I'd add the other things and I start
[SPEAKER_01]: writing everything down and it got to the
point where I was like, okay, I kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: know where all this lies at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had two scoops of the nutrient of the,
of the part a, and then I had one scoop of
[SPEAKER_01]: the part B and I had five milliliters of
this and that, and then it just,
[SPEAKER_01]: at some point, you know where the PPM
lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that, that's kind of where I'm at,
you know, great white, when I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: transplants, always helpful, you know,
as far as just dumping it on there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots, helps the development of the
transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't get any transplant shock.
[SPEAKER_02]: So call it simple, but I have my routine,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that bag of stash blend behind you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was wondering when you were going to
talk about that and incorporate that into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you'd be able to cut out some of
those bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned using seaweed and the
microbial inoculant and silica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's all located in stash
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be interesting to see if you
incorporate that in and be able to cut out
[SPEAKER_00]: some bottles and save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the whole reasons why we put
together that blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we met at a grower's garment,
you actually gave me a pack of a Chill-Out
[SPEAKER_01]: OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to grow those, I'm going to
grow those and I'm going to use the stash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to, I'm going to break myself
in and force, force it upon me to do what
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do to change that habit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll post updates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll, it'll be a, and I'll use the good
old AC infinity set up here to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's all perfect conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to, I got to, I got to break
myself here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely keep my eye out for that
one for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned using the veg plus
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually heard about that company
quite a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you follow their feeding chart at
a full dose or some folks will start with
[SPEAKER_00]: like a half dose for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if I remember correctly,
they're, they're, they're looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more than what I'm putting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think I don't need to, again,
I think that, you know, when it comes to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, harvesting medicinal plants,
you know, I get, I get what I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for in them, whether it's the flavor,
you know, the aroma, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects, I guess you can say,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't give the full dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I stick to my, what I do and,
you know, and, you know, my PPMs again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I think it's molasses,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That when you add that to your,
to your water, it's the PPM spikes pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was molasses, but my PPM
typically does not exceed like 700 on any
[SPEAKER_01]: given feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's in my opinion, pretty medium to
low.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think you mentioned that RO
water is that we're using for a water
[SPEAKER_00]: source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if it is, how do you go about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The watering throughout the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm fortunate to have an RO machine
built thing built into my, my,
[SPEAKER_01]: my kitchen tap here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, sometimes when
you're trying to pour like five gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: from that thing, it's not, it doesn't give
you what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get what I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then then my family yells at me
because they can't get new water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then I, I go in hiding,
but my tap is not so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of runs at like, I think 220 to
240 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is reasonable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I'll, I'll use that water
too, but you know, what I'll typically do
[SPEAKER_01]: is I'll pull, I'll pour it into like a big
container type thing and I'll let it sit
[SPEAKER_01]: for, you know, a good day or so to let the
chlorine and whatever else is in there
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of dissipate and leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I, I, you know, I use something
called drops of balance, which,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe we could talk about later,
but it helps clean the water as well of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps in a variety of ways,
but I, I, I like to water with by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whether it's using a bottle,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a hand pump if it's, if it's hard to
reach, but I kind of like getting in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, it forces you to kind of get,
get up in the plants and really get a good
[SPEAKER_01]: look at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so I don't mind, you know,
and typically if I'm going to travel or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, I plant my,
you know, you can kind of play games with
[SPEAKER_01]: your watering cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could push it one more day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could then water one more day
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in a, you know, down the road or
whatever, and then, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, I'm going to be gone for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I water them now, by the time I get
back, they'll be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they'll want water again or
feeding again, but they're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I coordinate myself on that,
but I like to have water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a good excuse to really kind of
get up in there and see what's going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the RO system under the sink
and I have the same thing and same problem
[SPEAKER_00]: where my fiance is like, you used up all
the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've done is I have individual
water jugs that I use now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one gallon jugs, and I just fill those
up and I have a whole line of them right
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm stockpiling water a little bit,
so I try to avoid running out of water at
[SPEAKER_00]: the, at the tap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the RO system for those that are kind
of interested, there's a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh, they're too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're thousands of dollars for a system,
which isn't true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are systems that I think I paid 250
for mine, $250 for mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, technology getting a little more
efficient here before it was up one to
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every one gallon of RO water,
you'd be wasting three gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now with the, uh, the one I have is
a one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the APEC ROES-100.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an essence series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was called, I just pulled it up right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every one gallon of RO water,
you only waste a one gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take that waste line,
they call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take that and put it into your own
five gallon bucket, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and use it on something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it on your house plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figure I'd mention that stuff that,
uh, yeah, RO water isn't as expensive as
[SPEAKER_00]: some may say it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't waste as much as it used
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The efficiency of those things is,
uh, it's, it's gotten much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So exactly when you're looking,
that's probably one of the key things
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for is what is the
efficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they're all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That 200 plus like right in that range,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Two to $300 these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's which one is the most effective
one and, and, you know, least wasteful,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And directly relating to water,
let's get into pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you monitor the pH at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one thing that I do,
um, religiously, you know, I, I like to,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to kind of keep it in a,
in the range of typically I'd say 6.0 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my sweet spot is typically around 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of do like them this fluctuate
between like, you know, 6.1 to 6.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's anywhere in that range,
I'm fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, one thing I want to do more
frequently is, is, uh, check the pH of the
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff just to kind of see where that
sits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because it, you know, that's a,
it's a pretty good indicator of kind of,
[SPEAKER_01]: am I, am I, you know, you know,
kind of what is it looking like there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know what's going in,
but how's it looking coming out kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tells you what the, uh, kind of what's,
what's being held up in the medium,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a, something that I should be
looking at more, more frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That and probably check in the PPM of my
runoff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just to kind of see where that's at,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned that you monitor
PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people do PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do EC instead for PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I caught that you do 500 PPM for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically go up to and
flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it doesn't typically exceed
seven 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of the bloom additives that
you know, when you, when you, when you
[SPEAKER_01]: include them, whether it's a big bud or,
uh, you know, there's a grow tech monster
[SPEAKER_01]: bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I realized the PPM doesn't increase
significantly when I add those to the,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to my nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't, it doesn't, I don't really
don't see it get past seven 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it's, it's not,
it's not too, you know, back in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when I first learned from my
friend, you know, saying pushing 1400 PPM
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on, you know, with certain,
you know, certain things and, and all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized, you know, I'm,
I'm giving half of that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the quality of, you know,
my finished product is significantly
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, at the end of the day,
you know, while, while most companies
[SPEAKER_01]: probably are being as truthful as they can
be, but they're not going to tell you to
[SPEAKER_01]: use this much, you know, because then the
product's going to sit there on your shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they probably want you to kind of get
through it fairly quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're probably telling you what you
should use at a maximum is their minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh yeah, this is what you need to
use because they want you to kind of come
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I could be way off,
but what I do know is I give a fraction of
[SPEAKER_02]: what they, you know, I've been told to,
and it comes out just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, plus, you know, when you're,
if you're transplanting and you're putting
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh soil, you know, you're taking this
and you're putting into something here,
[SPEAKER_01]: all this additional soil that you've added
into your pod is new and it's filled with
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kind of re-upping what was
depleted earlier to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right back in the, in the mix again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't, in my opinion, you don't
always need to be pushing them so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that PPM numbers that you're giving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the PPM of the nutrient solution
going into the soil or is that a runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad I clarified that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I think some people might be
thinking that was the runoff number.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the measurement going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to switch over now to another thing
that could be more of a problem in a
[SPEAKER_00]: garage than it is just fully indoor,
which is pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do in order to
prevent pests when growing in your garage?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, since my garage is typically
open, I know that I get a fresh dose of
[SPEAKER_01]: dust and stuff frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to keep not only the inside
of the environment clean at all times,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you've also got to work on keeping the
outside clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outside of the environment as clean as
you can too.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think first and foremost is be,
you know, be tidy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're spending a lot of time and
energy into these plants and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be lazy on that end of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, keep clean, inspect your
plants frequently as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't be two hands off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really got to look close because,
you know, for those of you that have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you know, Chris, I'm sure you've
had pests in the past, but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at your, your, your flowers,
if you're in flower or even if you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg, you're appreciating the flower and
you're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you know you've had pests in the
past, you don't, you realize your eyes are
[SPEAKER_01]: playing games on you now because you're
kind of looking away from everything and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking deeper into things because
you're trying to see movement or something
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, a bug or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to be as preventative as
possible, but some of the things I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I'll add sticky traps,
you know, sometimes I'll hang them outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of my tent and I'll put them inside the
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when I don't have a problem because
it might be an indicator of a problem on
[SPEAKER_01]: the horizon.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need to have an issue to have
a sticky trap kind of in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to take pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could take them out and make the
pictures look pretty again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think when you're not taking any
pictures or videotaping or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, leave one in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the, what's, what's the harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mentioned earlier,
I like, if my intake fans aren't being
[SPEAKER_01]: ducted with like AC or heater,
I like to put pantyhose over them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on the cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is a fantastic way of
letting air flow in still, but really
[SPEAKER_01]: acting as a pretty darn good screen to
kind of keep that dust and different types
[SPEAKER_01]: of sediment or whatever it might be
outside of your plan.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, you know, there's lots of
proactive measures you can do to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're not getting any infestation
because when it happens, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got to play the reactive
game, you know, and that's, it's no fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing any like sprays or anything
in like the veg stage to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've, what do people use like
dish soap and water?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, you know, I might want
to, I might want to look into using that
[SPEAKER_01]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do use, again, you know, drops of
balance, you know, you can use that as a
[SPEAKER_01]: foliar spray, which, which helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps really kind of, it's preventative
in lots of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps prevent plants from like,
you know, intaking insecticides and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I don't, aside from
spraying that, I haven't really sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: anything unless I've needed to,
you know, if I've had an infestation,
[SPEAKER_01]: then neem oil might come into play if I'm
in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm in flour, that's a different story,
you know, then you got different problems
[SPEAKER_01]: then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now have you had any major infestations of
any pestle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully major, I wouldn't say no,
you know, like I've seen pictures of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of spider mites and webs and it's like,
oh my gosh, like it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be so disheartening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I've had problems with,
you know, whiteflies, fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_01]: thrips, aphids, and, you know,
whiteflies are annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks like little dust flying around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really annoying, but they're not
so hard to handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really are a sucker for the yellow
sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are really helpful for those and
fungus gnats, you know, aphids and thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: are much more annoying, you know,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one right here, I had noticed some,
some damage from thrips recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to, and they're in, it's
thankfully they're in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was able to kind of, you know,
I haven't seen any lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thankfully I think I've, I've beat
them, but I, you know, it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of steps to take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when you're in veg, it's much
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in flour, I think, you know,
what I've done in the past and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, actually what I did with this
one here, for starters, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: use neem oil, spray them, spray them with
neem oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a preferred thing, but it does help,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of the top layer of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did a lot of visual killing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just kind of, your eyes are all
over your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a little bit of movement,
you kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I was doing that, I had ordered some
ladybugs off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ladybugs are, you know, there are,
you know, plant warriors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They help, they help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not, they're not evil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're what we want in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ordered some from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, you know, they showed up
during that extreme heat wave that we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think half of them were unfortunately
deceased when I opened up the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the package they came in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I let them fly in here and they did
their thing for, you know, I'd say a good
[SPEAKER_01]: week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of let them take care of
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it got to the point
where I pulled each pot out and I made
[SPEAKER_01]: sure there was none on there and they like
to go underneath the fabric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knocked them off and put them
outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I gave it one more spray of neem
oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I used diatomaceous earth as a
top layer, which is really great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also really annoying because it's
such a, it's so, it could be so messy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just white powder everywhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, you know, I top layered it and just
to make sure that if there was any larvae
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, whatever the middle stage of
those things are called people can't
[SPEAKER_01]: remember, but that, you know, this would
help kill them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I was using the neem oil for
the plant itself, see if I can take care
[SPEAKER_01]: of whatever was on the plant still,
if anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the diatomaceous earth,
I think helped kill whatever was still in
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then afterwards I just watered over
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, but now it's still little
dust particles here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of staring at the plants,
you see little white specks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you realize it's just
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just kind of rub it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But thankfully I've, I think I've rid
myself of that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a couple of steps, you know,
hopefully your users get some information
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I know neem oil is a bit
questionable, but, you know, you try to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy the one that's just, you know,
I think they sell organic versions or the
[SPEAKER_01]: diluted type or something, but it
ultimately helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to use that during flower
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: During flower probably just want to go the
diatomaceous earth on the soil and then
[SPEAKER_01]: let the ladybugs have at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whatever you see with your eyes
just kill what you can, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's something that's not, if it's a
mild infestation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's heavy, you probably might have to
just scrap it depending on how bad it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for explaining that in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have quite a few people that
battle pests and they definitely named off
[SPEAKER_00]: some, some good solutions there for people
to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, I want to get into misconceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say are some misconceptions
about growing in a garage?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you kind of hear different
things from different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that when it comes down
to it, if you can control your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, your garage is as good as a
laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it makes no difference, I think that if
you have things dialed in right and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got the right genetics, you know,
you can grow some high quality flower,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal flower or flowers, you know,
tomatoes, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything out, you know, any vegetables in
this environment, you know, and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: fortunate enough to be part of a kind of
an experiment where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to test things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even those home testing kits are
really pricey.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to medicinal plants,
but I was fortunate enough to be part of
[SPEAKER_01]: an experiment where, you know,
what I, what I grew here right behind me
[SPEAKER_01]: was sent to a lab and professionally
tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm not trying to toot my
horn here, but you know, what I grew right
[SPEAKER_01]: behind me in a garage in Los Angeles,
San Fernando Valley tested 30 plus and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and you know, 28,
28.1% THCA.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was, you know, I was happy,
you know, you kind of become proud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, all right, you did pretty
good, Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the primary misconception is
that this is not like an outhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like an outside, oh, you're kind of,
you know, shunned and you got to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: your garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it work here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's some things that you
might need to use that a traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: drawer that's growing inside a air
conditioned climate controlled environment
[SPEAKER_01]: might not have to, or even in a bedroom or
a bathroom, you know, but you can make it
[SPEAKER_01]: work in the garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do have a lot of beginners that
tune into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you for those folks that are
beginners that are just getting started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in a garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for them?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think the community is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's no right way to grow
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants kind of grow themselves and you're
just kind of helping them along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, tuning into,
you know, podcasts, like this one right
[SPEAKER_01]: here, and then some of the other people
out there like, you know, CLTV,
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Scrogger, you know, the,
you know, the AC infinity after dark
[SPEAKER_01]: folks, you know, you learn a lot from
different people, you know, I,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a number of people, you know,
when I first started growing, you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like you're on your own little
island, you know, that you don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your friends might not grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't really don't have anyone much
to talk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I kind of saw the Instagram
community and I was like, Ooh,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, started linking with
people from that, from that community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I realized, wow, YouTube has so
many cool things as far as like medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: growing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found Mr. Grow and then I found
people like, welcome to the grow tent and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosa Green and you know, just a variety of
these people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as time grew, some of these other
people came in, then you just kind of see
[SPEAKER_01]: what works for you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to kind of come up with your own
formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always have to scrub.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always have to top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't always have to do these
different types of things that someone
[SPEAKER_01]: tells you you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to do to grow, you know,
grade a medicinal flower, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you know, there's different methods
that are going to work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just have to kind of dial in
what's going to work best for you and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then go from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then another thing is, you know,
I know income and money is different for
[SPEAKER_02]: different people, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if just don't voluntarily go cheap,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, I'm not going to blame anyone
for going economical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of go with what works for you,
but chances are, if you're going to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: some dinky thing off like Alibaba or
something like that, I can guarantee
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to upgrade it because it's
not going to get you what you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buy what's going to work best for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what you know is going to provide
you the best environment because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to spend a little bit of money and
then be able to grow something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you maybe saved a little bit more
or whatever and put another hundred,
[SPEAKER_01]: $150 or whatever it might be into a
something that's got environmental
[SPEAKER_01]: controls and something that's really going
to help you just grow better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just say, just hold off, save another
paycheck, do whatever you have to do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but don't go cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these cheap lights, cheap tents,
cheap nutrients, cheap genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It, it, you're starting off at a,
on a, on a kind of behind, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of starting off at a negative
and in, you know, you could be as good as
[SPEAKER_01]: you can be, you can only get so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if you've got that,
that the foundation of a good environment
[SPEAKER_01]: and good lights and good exhaust and the
fans and all that stuff, it's just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to help you that much more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So call it a team game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're getting towards the end of the
episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they could
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can find me on primarily on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my, my handles wake and bake
with Paul.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I just opened up a face,
but it's, you know, it's really nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a dinky YouTube channel with
like, you know, that many followers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so it's not really anything right
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really my, my Instagram, um,
is where you can find me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for future sake, you know,
I'm going to be working on a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: things, um, some more breeding,
you know, I, you know, I'm going to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: up, I'm going to go to chill out OG and,
you know, and I've got something going
[SPEAKER_01]: called cat piss right now that,
you know, I'm kind of looking,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm trying to go back to those,
that 90s funk, that, that stink that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was out there from back in the damn,
you know, I'm going to make an attempt to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm going to keep working with,
you know, uh, drops of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I, I did an experiment
with them a little while back where I had
[SPEAKER_01]: a control on an uncontrolled grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to kind of focus on
control all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to add it in because what
it, you know, it really kind of helped,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, at the end, it helped the chirping
profile of what I, what I had grown,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shameless plug.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys are looking for any drops of
balance or new from perfect gardens,
[SPEAKER_01]: DOB 10, that's my discount code.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it, you know, I stand behind that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was really cool, but I'm going
to keep playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to do different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, uh, something that my friend
was showing me the other day is called,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, electro culture where he had
sent a picture of somebody that had grown
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant with this huge copper wire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just kind of Googled it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for like 10 bucks, I bought something
from Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a copper thing that kind of
grows with your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently the, uh, the energy in the,
in the air, it kind of goes through the
[SPEAKER_01]: copper wiring and it helps plants thrive
apparently.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to keep doing some funny
experiments that I like to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I, I like to, you know,
I like to play with plants.
