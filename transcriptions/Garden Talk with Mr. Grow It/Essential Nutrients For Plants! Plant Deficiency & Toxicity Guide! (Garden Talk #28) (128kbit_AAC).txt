[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, they talk about,
and I'm one of those people, is the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest tastes green, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't taste natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're pumping your plant with the
wrong nitrogen and it's producing excess
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf or growing too fast and your harvest
comes out bad, well, it's because what the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is doing, right, is producing more
amino acids for growth and not the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids or peptides or proteins for
flowering or flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how much manganese do we use
and why is it responsible for over 300
[SPEAKER_01]: coenzyme reactions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we not making it more significant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If people are on well water, well water
for some reason always has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: sodium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw in sulfur in your soil, it's going
to help regulate your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just blown away by that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one molecule, it turns the ether into
reality where you can touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm fascinated with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the Garden Talk podcast,
this episode number 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Mark
Boutwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark is the owner of Perfect Gardens,
which is an online hydroponic store that
[SPEAKER_00]: has been in operation since 2009.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also has a YouTube channel where he
uploads science-based horticultural videos
[SPEAKER_00]: to his audience of over 25,000
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about some of
the essential nutrients for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also touches upon what deficiency and
toxicities look like for those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he created a full presentation with
pictures for you to follow along.
[SPEAKER_00]: A link to the presentation is in the
YouTube description section, so if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: tuning in on one of the podcast platforms,
I recommend heading over to YouTube so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can access the presentation link.

[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm joined with Mark Boutwell from
Perfect Gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey brother, how are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to say thank you so much for
letting me on the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all your content, and I appreciate
this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for coming on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been requested by multiple
people, and you know, when I went to your
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, like I knew about your channel
probably about six months ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, or something like that,
is when I first found out about your
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been on YouTube for a long time,
longer than that, and you have some really
[SPEAKER_00]: detailed videos with, you get into like a
lot of science, so I thought you'd be a
[SPEAKER_00]: great person to have on the podcast,
and we're gonna go over the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: elements for plants today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all of them, you know, there's a lot
of them, so we'll touch on a good amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of them today, and then maybe,
maybe if the audience requests it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can do a part two with the remaining
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark did a full presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically, there's 41 slides,
41 slides, and that's what we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: over right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on YouTube, just go to the
description section.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be the second link down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put Mark's channel link first,
then I'll put the link to the
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
any of the podcast platforms, I highly
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that you go to YouTube and click
on this presentation, and kind of follow
[SPEAKER_00]: along with us, because one of the things
in here, as we get deeper into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and start talking about some of the
elements, there are pictures, pictures of
[SPEAKER_00]: what deficiencies look like, toxicities,
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself,
kind of let us know a little bit about you
[SPEAKER_00]: and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just before I start, I just want to
encourage people to go down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: description and grab the link.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like how Chris said, I created a
presentation with tons of pictures,
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of things that you could follow along
with, and in the future, I will expand
[SPEAKER_01]: this presentation to other plants,
so you'll be able to do cross-references
[SPEAKER_01]: with lots of other plants, and not just be
specific to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so just want to get into family
history, because in some level,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so Georgia's Botwell created the
IRS.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our family hired the first 4,000 employees
and worked with Abraham Lincoln himself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We created the tracking system to track
the debt to pay back the centralized
[SPEAKER_01]: baking system with the greenbacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving on with that, my mother and
father, Mark Winnie, about all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: migrant farm workers, they developed the
systems and processes for harvesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, and distribution of lettuce in
Monterey County from 1977 to 1989.
[SPEAKER_01]: Production went from 1,400 pounds an hour
to over 65,000 pounds an hour in only 12
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: The significant thing about that is the
farmers, prior to this point, couldn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: past 1,400 pounds, and we're talking like
a 70 to 100 year span, and they were maxed
[SPEAKER_01]: out, and their thought process was,
why try to grow more if they can't harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: it and sell it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to that, a lot of the
reason why we use chlorine on food to
[SPEAKER_01]: extend shelf life is because my father,
it's also the reason why our family,
[SPEAKER_01]: through many conversations, we've
acknowledged mineral deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_01]: people overall, because of what chlorine
does through the microbiology on plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think a lot of this presentation is
going to go into the depth around science,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it talks a lot about how all these
things connect.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the 40-year family span,
we also, at one point, were worth $35
[SPEAKER_01]: million through construction, fixing and
flipping long-term rentals from 89 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: We opened up a family loan office,
and wrote over $3 billion in loans to
[SPEAKER_01]: homeowners from 2003 to 2007.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I joined the military to
12th Parade Rescue in 2005 after dropping
[SPEAKER_01]: out of college.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where it ended up really
taking a twist in us going heavy deep into
[SPEAKER_01]: the other types of industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually lost $34.75 million in the
real estate crash in 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used the last bit of wealth to open up
Perfect Gardens in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, we started, operated,
and got busted the largest indoor grow
[SPEAKER_01]: facility in the state of California from
2009 to 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: Total operations spanned 1,000-plus
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mushroom farm is what we called it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, we rotated through between 35 and 70
minor operations, averaging 6 to 20 lights
[SPEAKER_01]: per operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grow coached each and every one of
these people until stands were met
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I started a half-acre grow
from December 2013 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: Harvested approximately 5,000 pounds
before being shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then went on to develop a new industrial
water extraction method for large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, 1,000-plus acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only went into the research and prototype
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got shut from 2014 to 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we completed the largest hemp
biomass transaction in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 800,000 pounds from Oregon to
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a $39 million deal followed up by a
two-year lawsuit for unpaid commissions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you can see, as you could tell,
we've had successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I can say is our failures have led to
other successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into Perfect Gardens real
quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our vision is I think Canada farmers are
going to solve our world's ag problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mission here at Perfect Gardens is we
help you grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our values is integrity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Putting the shopping cart back every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sustainability, doing our due diligence,
and being present.
[SPEAKER_01]: One problem, one solution at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just food for thought for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about who's growing and who's
farming right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have grandmas, grandpas, community
gardens, Canada farmers, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: large-scale corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow 98% of the food, and they
encompass only 2% of the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those average farmers that own all that
land, their age is between 60 and 70,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're one heart attack away from
dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most unique thing about the
Canada industry is that we have created a
[SPEAKER_01]: very inexpensive way of testing the
quality of these plants through testing
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think by cross-referencing these
terpene profiles, we'll be able to examine
[SPEAKER_01]: our ag growing practices and hopefully
scale up healthier growing practices as
[SPEAKER_01]: the Canada farmers take over the land in
the next 10 to 15 years, as obviously the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry collapses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a real long family history
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real extensive, and it goes way,
way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you started in 1862, and there's a
lot of successes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some major numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even included some loss, you know,
that tragic loss you had with the real
[SPEAKER_00]: estate crash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you had mentioned that you had
successes and failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just gotta keep on going, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And after that big failure that you had in
2007, 2008, I mean, it looks like you had
[SPEAKER_00]: even greater success, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking one step back, two steps forward
type scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And congrats on all your success so far
with that and Perfect Gardens,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to that website there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice website.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a lot going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thanks for that introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's continue on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the next thing up that you wanted
to kind of talk about here that's on your
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation is the law of minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get into that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two laws that I think are being
overlooked dramatically, and a big idea
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way down is the law of minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one, law minimum states that the
growth is dictated not by the total
[SPEAKER_01]: resources available, but by the scarcest
resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you have all the minerals,
the best lights, best sun, but you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: watering your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at that point, that's the scarcest
resource and your plants die.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes along the same with trace
minerals, macro minerals, light,
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, humidity, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, Mark Twain said
whiskey is for drinking, water is for
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give another example, if I may.
Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, CO2 is one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have your environment dialed in,
your proper temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything could be properly watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could have the proper nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighting could be dialed in,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your CO2 level is low, your plant's
just going to operate at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the law of minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, another example would be you
could have everything dialed in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, but say you don't have VPD dialed in,
for example, the temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf surface temperature, it'll
operate at that lower level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's something that we don't
talk about a lot, much at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you covered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the law of tolerance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the law of tolerance, and just to talk
exactly what you're saying too,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's because everyone's trying to
sell something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're trying to market their
thing as being the best thing versus
[SPEAKER_01]: encompassing everything as a whole and as
an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into the law of tolerance,
exactly what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the law of tolerance states that a law
stating that the abundance or distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: of an organism can be controlled by
certain factors where levels of these
[SPEAKER_01]: exceed the maximum or minimum limits of
tolerance of that organism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the extremes, absolute minimum or
too much, you have zones of intolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then because these plants are so,
all plants are amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll do everything in their power to
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just don't water a plant for a
week and then come back and water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably come back, believe it or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have your tolerance range,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you might just be kind of paying
attention, watering every so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have your optimum range where
you're carrying about everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're carrying drip irrigation,
your microbiology, you're carrying about
[SPEAKER_01]: your lights, everything you're saying,
and that's your optimum range.
[SPEAKER_00]: The visual that you have here is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a great visual.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH, I think, is one that I kind of want to
highlight and talk about for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it shows like an optimum range for
pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally speaking, I think a lot of
people, what they go by for soil pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, for the plant that we all
know and love is for soil pH, you're often
[SPEAKER_00]: said in between 6.0 and 7.0 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that might be the optimum range,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes I'll get growers that say,
oh, my pH is, I'm in soil and my pH is 5.8
[SPEAKER_00]: or my pH is 5.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, how does your plant look?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant looks fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that just goes into your tolerance
range, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that lower pH, maybe 5.5, for example,
down as low as 5.5 is in your tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you probably won't get optimum
nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be some issues with slow
growth potentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having an optimum range and then that
tolerance range, yeah, I think this paints
[SPEAKER_00]: a great picture for a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see temperatures in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm glad you put this in here as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you gave great examples,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so thank you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so the next slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next slide, I think, is absolutely
incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to describe it, it's a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has tons of minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a few of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what I'm doing is I'm showing how
all these different minerals correlate,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is the first time where I want
to use some terminology where I think many
[SPEAKER_01]: industries are throwing things out,
trying to confuse people from marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: and to just capitalize on the ROI.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to bring you behind the veil,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single time different minerals
work together, that becomes a coenzyme
[SPEAKER_01]: production situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to show you that in science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every single time when I say,
bacteria's make coenzymes, so when I say
[SPEAKER_01]: that, or I say aids in activating
coenzymes, think of this chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to explain,
oh, wow, OK, so all these minerals work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you flip your bottle back in the
back and you look at it, and you only have
[SPEAKER_01]: NPK, or you only have a couple
macrominerals, think about this chart,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what are you missing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Going into what you were just saying,
mobile and immobile nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at this point, this next chart,
if you didn't want to listen to the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of this podcast, which I highly recommend
you do so to geek out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't want to, this chart,
this next one's going to really just break
[SPEAKER_01]: it down for you and make it super simple
to identify your problems or narrow it
[SPEAKER_01]: down to what it most likely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's three things I want you to
absolutely remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Immobile, mobile, and semi-mobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immobile nutrients will, if there's a
deficiency or excess, it's going to appear
[SPEAKER_01]: in the newer leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why is that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So immobile nutrients is when the plant
needs nutrients at one specific time and
[SPEAKER_01]: won't need it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it doesn't have it while it's
growing or producing, it's going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: up as an immobile nutrient because it
doesn't have what it needs at that one
[SPEAKER_01]: point to grow properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mobile nutrients shows up in the older
leaves first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant can rob that nutrients
from the older leaves and take it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: newer leaves to do its newer function,
growing, flowering, producing,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Semi-mobile is nutrients can actually show
up in the older or newer, and sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's finicky, sometimes it's going to
matter on the pH, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just know that semi-mobile nutrients
can show up in the older or newer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go further down through the
pictures, I'm going to show you very
[SPEAKER_01]: clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I show you the picture, you're going
to be like, oh, okay, I've seen this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because we've all seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so many deficiencies that look
similar because there's secondary
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies underlying it that it's
difficult to really identify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see over a million plants and
a number of different plants from just
[SPEAKER_01]: one, and you see a whole bunch of them,
you see this deficiency, it becomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, it's really clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go ahead and get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one thing I wanted to mention before
we move on is this chart right here,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it breaks it down between primary
nutrients, secondary nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: macronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the symbol there, and then I assume
that third column, correct me if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong, mobile or immobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for nitrogen, yes as mobile,
or is mobile, yes or no, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nitrogen, for example, and I'm sure
we're going to go on this once we talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about nitrogen, but nitrogen is a good
example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of beginners would come
across a nitrogen deficiency and realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that the bottom part of the plant,
the leaves are going to start to turn
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow from the tips moving up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's happening is it's a mobile
nutrient that's being relocated to the new
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I won't jump too ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you keep on going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly how you describe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to, like you said,
if we stop at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll come back to it in part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing is just
coming into that awareness part of
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself where you're exactly what you're
feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, okay, it's starting in the
old growth and it's turning yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look at where it's starting at the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're starting to really realize,
oh, wow, it's robbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're starting to identify how it's
showing up, whether it's showing up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: tip or it's showing up right where the
stem meets the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all these things will show small
characteristics of what's happening within
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like they say, it's like animal
whisper, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But you become a plant whisperer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just because you're seeing these
commonalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for actually pointing that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very helpful, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next slide, two ways to fix most of the
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to keep it simple again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, most of the slide is about geeking
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How to solve my problem is that's what
most people are concerned about,
[SPEAKER_01]: two ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flush the plant, pH it, and restart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, which most people don't talk about,
is balance the minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes into play at the law of
minimum and the law of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so let's dive into the first one,
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to talk about the nitrogen
cycle because, and this one, it breaks
[SPEAKER_01]: down the chemistry really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want you to use this as a mental
template as we talk about calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, phosphorus, and all these other
ones because there are many different
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical manufacturers out there that make
other types of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they mark it as nitrogen or
phosphorus or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to show you right here by
science how science uses nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: how it changes the molecular structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to show you how there
are other nitrogens that come up in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry or other big ag industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why are they putting that nitrogen in
there when there's the natural nitrogens
[SPEAKER_01]: that are fertilizer that they can
synthesize and sell that are just as
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable and relatively close to the same
price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why they do it,
but it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so the nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are five parts of the nitrogen
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a nitrogen fixation, a simulation,
a modification, nitrification,
[SPEAKER_01]: and denitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen fixation is basically when the
nitrogen gas and let's say electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: bulb or electricity fires off ends up
turning, it ends up electrifying nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: and it turns it into a nitrogen dioxide.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes from N2 to NO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so then when that's electrified,
it combines to water and then becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So NHO3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that entire process is nitrogen
fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then when it comes down to the ground,
the plants can actually take up the nitric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why things turn green right after
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they watch the mountains or the fields
after a rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that nitrogen acid though, when the
bacteria get a hold of it, the bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: will begin to convert it over into
ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ammonia is NH3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then as it gets assimilated into
the plant and the bacteria continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep converting it, it turns into
ammonium, which is NH4 plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the plants take it up and die
or animals die, the fungi actually hold
[SPEAKER_01]: onto the ammonia and convert into nitrites
and nitrates and slowly release it back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the plants take it up, it's
assimilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the plants die, it's a modification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the fungi hold onto it and slowly
release it back into the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's nitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the forest is burned down or
evaporation happens, then that is
[SPEAKER_01]: denitrification.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these things go back up into the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the complete cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so correct me if I'm wrong,
but you pretty much explained it here is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant can uptake multiple forms
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing that's kind of unique
about nitrogen, from my understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NH4 plus, I think you explained
that they're able to uptake and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: NO3 minus the nitrate is what they're able
to uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: To my understanding, they're actually able
to take up three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what the fertilizer industry
tries to replace for this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tries to replace the fungi and
bacteria because the fungi and bacteria do
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversion, the coenzyme reaction
process or cation or anions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna get into that later,
the terminology of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically the fungi and bacteria do
these conversions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what science does is it removes the
fungi and bacteria conversion and it does
[SPEAKER_01]: it for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you will actually see right over here
and I'll go into the next slide before I
[SPEAKER_01]: go into the other nitrogens that the
industry uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just go real quick into nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think it's described,
isn't described properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen is the building blocks of
amino acids, peptides and proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So amino acids, peptides and proteins are
made of organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are organic compounds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic compounds are carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those things are, I think become really
interesting for me at this point because
[SPEAKER_01]: in science, for human beings and plants,
there's actually a disconnection of what
[SPEAKER_01]: are, when amino acids become peptides and
when peptides become proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I've had to create my own
terminology or my own definition
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so amino acids are basically within
one to 10% individual acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they come together, more,
they will become peptides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are creations of,
again, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when they become bind to a
mineral, that's when they become a
[SPEAKER_01]: protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's my definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that reading all these
different things and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like when it binds to the minerals,
that's when it actually becomes a protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the nitrogen cycle, there are seven
chemical structures nitrogen goes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talked about that, N2, NO2,
NHO3, NH3, NH4+, NO3- and NH2-.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, why does the ag industry
use four plus nitrogens outside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural nitrogen cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're putting stuff like ammonium
nitrate ammonia nitrogen and urea in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a number of other different nitrogens
in the other videos, I show you a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of different nitrogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are NH4, NO3, NH3-, N and CO,
NH2 to the second power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to do that every time,
but what I'm really just trying to show
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys is that there are all these
different types of chemical structures and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's natural chemical structures that
nature goes through that these chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies can actually use these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just go to the store,
look in the back of the bottle and see
[SPEAKER_01]: what the chemical structure is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not using the natural
chemical structures, put the bottle back
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's only going to destroy the
microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen, nitrogen is a mobile
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already talked about that, so we won't
get too heavily into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do kind of want to explain a little
bit around excess, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're giving too much nitrogen,
why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're using urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what does nitrogen do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amino acids, peptides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does amino acids and peptides are
meant for?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're meant for the growing part of
these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the stem will elongate,
and that's why the stems will become weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually the reason, in many
cases, why this industry sells so much
[SPEAKER_01]: bamboo and support equipment is because of
the chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like solving the problem because
not being thoughtful where the problem got
[SPEAKER_01]: started, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we start to create other solutions
to minimize that problem, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about too much nitrogen,
the plants get really dark green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to the point where it's fake and
you can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it just doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of people, they talk about,
and I'm one of those people, is the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest tastes green, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't taste natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because those, in the beginning,
they're using a whole bunch of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you in the chemical
structure, the whole bunch of nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_01]: the initial amino acid coenzyme process
with the bacterias to grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when those nitrogens and those
organic compounds combine to the trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals, the smaller minerals later,
they're used later in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're using totally different ratios
so that's why when you're pumping your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant with the wrong nitrogen and it's
producing excess leaf or growing too fast
[SPEAKER_01]: and your harvest comes out bad,
well, it's because what the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: doing, right, is producing more amino
acids for growth and not for the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids or peptides or proteins for
flowering or flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why a lot of people are,
they say they flush at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if I'm jumping ahead
here, but it kind of opens up a can of
[SPEAKER_00]: worms because there's going to be so many
people that say, oh, flushing is
[SPEAKER_00]: pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's going to be people that
say, flushing is a must, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you hit the nail on the head
here, the excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did, I know there's been studies
that came out and actually did a video on
[SPEAKER_00]: a study that came out on flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I had said as
kind of my thoughts is that I like to see
[SPEAKER_00]: that fade in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to see that senescence,
you know, because I also felt like I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had plants where it had excess nitrogen
and I did have that taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally do look for that fade to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, whether or not I have to flush the
plant, you know, it depends on if I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing that fade or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm glad you brought that up as
far as the harvesting tasting green to the
[SPEAKER_00]: excess nitrogen, because I personally felt
like I've accounted that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually love you brought the whole
flushing topic up for just a second
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's really funny, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a polar complex going in the
industry from flour to extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter whether you're in the
sugar industry or whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about harvesting and then packaging
up as tight as possible to sell it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: end consumer to be re-infused into other
products and sold again.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point of this is that the flushing
process, and I really loved what you do
[SPEAKER_01]: with that because it actually helps me
even think a little bit more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if you thought about this
prior, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you take the end product and take
into the extraction team, what was their
[SPEAKER_01]: issue with it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Too much chlorophyll in the extraction
process, which made the extraction process
[SPEAKER_01]: much more intensive to get to that end
product as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are using, when you're
flushing, you're actually starting the
[SPEAKER_01]: degradation process of the plant earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to that, the plant needs
nitrogen up to the point to the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: flour to keep doing the amino acid
reactions to produce terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is, and the damage that was
created through using the wrong nitrogens
[SPEAKER_01]: in the beginning, it's already been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like relatively the
product's going to, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: the product's going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the product, the plants didn't
have the right nitrogens to produce the
[SPEAKER_01]: right CoAms and reactions with the other
trace minerals and not enough time was
[SPEAKER_01]: there to produce those other terpene
profiles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're kind of hitting it on both
sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're hitting it on the nitrogen,
forcing it to grow, which you're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: more starches and more of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're also hitting it where the
plant doesn't have the other trace mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: CoAms reaction time to get to the point
where it's capable of producing the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super interesting for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people go right into the MPK,
MPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm going into the building blocks of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one is the benefits of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is another organic compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are just going to say this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see this stuff on the internet and
right here we're going to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amino acid, it helps with amino
acid formation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about those five organic
compounds needed for amino acids and for
[SPEAKER_01]: peptides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when do they become a protein is
when it attaches itself to the other
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll show you this a little bit later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So enzyme and vitamin development.
[SPEAKER_01]: We already talked about that, law of
minimum, law of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is also a big marketing
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's saying fulvic acid,
fulvic acid, humic acid, humic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, fulvic and humic acid are normally
composed of amino acids bonded to sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is getting behind the veil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get caught up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where this plays a part is where they
got their raw materials and where they did
[SPEAKER_01]: their extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it makes a good humic or
fulvic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the amino acid product is
where their initial raw material is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting and their extraction process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sulfur helps complete incomplete
chemical reactions, whether by nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: so using meals like bone meal,
blood meal, or a synthetic chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are, this is where, again,
if you are growing outdoors and you amend
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil with a little bit of sulfur and
you're using a manmade nitrate,
[SPEAKER_01]: that sulfur is actually going to help with
the chemical reaction to revert it back to
[SPEAKER_01]: a natural nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just takes time and time with short
crops is not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur lowers the pH in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tip here, if people are on well water,
and well water for some reason always has
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of sodium or anyone that is tapping
into water with high amounts of sodium,
[SPEAKER_01]: throw in sulfur in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna help regulate your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is needed in seed production and
photosynthesis for the nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is now where it's getting a little
more complicated or complex in the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical reaction part.
[SPEAKER_01]: This comes into play when you balance the
sulfur and nitric acid equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up needing a lot of nitric acid to
balance one molecule of sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: During this balancing, the bacteria have
time to convert it from ammonia in H3 to
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonia nitrogen in H2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of time it takes for the
nitric acid to become stable is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of time it takes for your bacteria
to convert it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tip here, this is where mycorrhizae
fungi are beneficial in soil to increase
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur content because fungi holds onto
sulfur waiting for rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is why you will see mushrooms right
after rain and it's why your fungi colony
[SPEAKER_01]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a semi-mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look to the newer, later, older growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, go to the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna see pictures that it's almost
impossible for me to describe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although the lime green is just so clear
when you see it that it's just gonna pop
[SPEAKER_01]: out at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to the slide and check out the
pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best ways I can recommend
to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and you guys can thank Susan for not
allowing us to post the pictures on
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Susan's the CEO of YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would get flagged and blah,
blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, these pictures you have on the
slide, I mean, pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see it on the newer growth there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yellowing, it looks like it's coming
from kind of like the stem there upwards
[SPEAKER_00]: to the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can clearly see yellow and then the
green on the tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more additional tall tale is there are
three deficiencies that have purple
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur is one of those deficiencies which
creates a purple characteristic in the
[SPEAKER_01]: stems, veining in the stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't notice it,
but it's one of those things where a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people are like, hey, do I got a purple
strain going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, when they're actually running into a
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Purple stems, I mean, that's a whole can
of worms there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's so many different reasons
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard nutrient balances was another
reason for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I haven't heard that sulfur in
particular, which that's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you just said it right there,
a nutrient imbalance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And sulfur does organic compounds,
amino acids and peptides to create
[SPEAKER_01]: proteins which are later used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, cold temps is another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cold temps, or if you like water the plant
with cold water, like under roughly 65
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or lower than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like overnight, like the next day,
you can see like it's not just like a
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up purple stem, the entire stem,
but it's kind of like streaks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see streaks of purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you see the streaking at all,
you can probably contribute to these low
[SPEAKER_00]: temps or low water temp giving it to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's worth mentioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually causing a plant
deficiency in that moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll explain that in one of the other
deficiency slides.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was caught up in the same thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, throw on the ice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm thinking like, whoa,
we're growing way too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot recommend all my growers to get
all this ice and put it on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This does not make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start digging into the
thought process behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, actually I'm creating
a plant deficiency right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes into, we'll go into it in a
few minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benefits of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus, root growth, flowering and
seeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So photosynthesis collects the sun and
carbon dioxide to produce ATP,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So adenosine triphosphate plus oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP will attach itself to three phosphate
groups to become a sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we're talking about amino
acids, peptides, proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is when it becomes, in my
viewpoint, a protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that science is a C10H16N5O13P3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a coenzyme reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: People might argue with me on when I'm
using this terminology properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I didn't go, I didn't read the
books at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I get curious and I start reading
lots of different people's perspectives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you read thousands of
words, you kind of formulate your own
[SPEAKER_01]: thought process to it in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants release the O2 and store the
energy in the form of sugars, glucose in
[SPEAKER_01]: the root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which later become binds with amino acids
to become aka exodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another terminology in the
industry that I think a lot of people use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's not really understood the
connection, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Between photosynthesis and when it becomes
exodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it becomes exodite is when that
sugar attaches to other amino acids,
[SPEAKER_01]: which again become an exodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which stimulates root growth and bacteria
and fungi development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it stores the energy in the root
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots for nighttime growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously nighttime growth is the optimal
for plants to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And roots are the storage, the battery for
them in how I look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Photosynthesis gets shut down dramatically
without phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we explained why.
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP and the triphosphate groups and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus is actually another one that
has purple characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different from magnesium and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the other three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus, magnesium and sulfur have
purple characteristics and deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple pigments in the leaves mixed with
the green any time prior to the two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: of harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like, everything is obviously I'm
saying is not like keystone.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are these things where in my years
of growing and grow coaching I had to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go into a room very quickly and
identify the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get out because I had to go to the
next operation to identify their problems
[SPEAKER_01]: and go on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to be able to see certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whenever I see purple pigmentation two
weeks from harvest, I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is too early for autumn situation to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start to be like, okay,
this is kind of a tell that lets me depict
[SPEAKER_01]: what type of deficiency I'm having.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is caused by accumulation of sugars
that produce anthocyanin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Followed by necrosis of the leaves similar
to calcium deficiency, although five times
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five times worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you want to look for a mobile
nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom of the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Older leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Older of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Older of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, you know, and if,
as I go through this, I encourage you to
[SPEAKER_01]: pause the video and then before I answer
it, put your answer in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be like, I think it's this, you know,
and just go along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, who cares if you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phosphorus, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say, I know with phosphorus
deficiency, I've come across this multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the Fox farm nutrient lineup,
for example, and in their lineup,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some nutrient lineups that
they come with excess phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's soil scientists that say,
Hey, some of these bottle lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have excess phosphorus in it and it's
going to lock it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In reality, that nutrient formula probably
should just be changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has less phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't lock out, for example,
or maybe, maybe I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it wasn't an excess of phosphorus
that locked it out, but maybe it was not
[SPEAKER_00]: enough phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I know that there's some
nutrients, I don't have them memorized,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's some nutrients that lock out
other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's an excess of them, I'm not sure
if you covered that in this presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have them memorized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple of them memorized,
but not a lot of them, but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus can get locked out due to
excess of other nutrients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're going back to the first two
laws, law of minimum and law of tolerance
[SPEAKER_01]: right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I straight up guys, I don't know
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go back to my references.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why I make notes like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I nowadays don't have the best memory
probably because of the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, but that's why I take really
diligent notes so I can go back,
[SPEAKER_01]: share it with someone else and they can,
we have the confidence together that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: solving the problem together and we can
reference it in other ways because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the situation with growing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is you have a certain amount of time to do
your best to bring in that crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter about being the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It matters about solving the problem and
bringing in the harvest because some
[SPEAKER_01]: farms, they have a lot of micro,
micro economics around them with,
[SPEAKER_01]: with employees and taxes and all that
other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important that that crop comes in
on time and in line with your values.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, so this is the purple pigmentation,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that everyone's seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's so clear and it looks like
autumn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like autumn, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you, and you, you'll notice it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benefits of potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aids in photosynthesis and food
formation helps convert sugar into
[SPEAKER_01]: starches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is also another big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we talked about nitric acid plant
takes it up a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we talked about the amino acids and
we talked about converting into ATP and
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar, but the plant actually only can use
a little bit of that sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually has to convert it into
starches for later use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about the batteries in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the starches are stored in the root
system for longterm use increases root
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and improves drought tolerance by
building cellulose and reducing weak
[SPEAKER_01]: stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put your hands on the,
on the plant, that's cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, so just like anything,
think about going over to the beach with a
[SPEAKER_01]: really thin cooler, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a very thin cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all the ice is going to melt fairly
quickly, but you have a really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's as a great insulation layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, your ice is going to be in there
just about all day long and you'll be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to feel, you know, refreshed throughout
the whole day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same thing with this plant
by building that, by the building,
[SPEAKER_01]: that building up the cellulose,
the plant's able to not evaporate as much
[SPEAKER_01]: water away on hot days.
[SPEAKER_01]: It maintains turgor pressure, reduces
water loss and wilting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So turgor pressure is the pressure of the
water within the cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so more water pressure and you
know, it's going to fill up and it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay in there versus once again,
being evaporated away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases protein content of plants,
which are organic compounds, amino acids
[SPEAKER_01]: bonded with minerals in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with more turgor pressure and less
water being evaporated away, the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to have more time for other
coenzyme reactions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But if the plant's constantly having to
refill up its tank, well, it doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough time to do more coenzyme reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is that process where that's what
potassium helps do.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why the water system is the blood
transportation system for more coenzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's how potassium aids in activating
at least 60 other coenzymes being
[SPEAKER_01]: produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go back to the law of minimum,
law of tolerance, that chart where you see
[SPEAKER_01]: all the minerals working together,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you have water and time,
you have time for that coenzyme reaction
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: With more coenzyme reactions happening,
the plant's able to achieve its true
[SPEAKER_01]: potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps stop the spread of crop disease
and nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, nematodes come because of stagnated
water, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have more water retention and
you have more minerals in the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the water is going to stay healthy and
you're just going to be able to fight off
[SPEAKER_01]: disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you going to look for the
mobile nutrient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Older leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't keep doing that to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paused for a minute so the audience
could think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep doing it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll keep doing it then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next one, potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is just so clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we've seen this so often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chorosis starts on the upper half of the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all I want to do is just take that one
leaf off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even want to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that one leaf dying, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's showing me signs of what the rest
of the crop is going to grow through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I pay attention to that one leaf,
I'm going to be saving myself through
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies later through crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's going to go to the presentation
to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see it, you're going to be like,
oh, wow, I have probably have a potassium
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency in my grow room right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do want to mention that
relates to potassium is it's potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I do know is we talked about the
relationship of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potassium and calcium are antagonistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what that means in
simplified terms is they kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: against each other in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that's the easiest way I can
explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a scenario happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody posted on my forum, Mr. Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to post pictures of Grow,
you have questions or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can head over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I had mentioned is,
hey, he was in late flowering and he
[SPEAKER_00]: started getting calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked him what his nutrient regimen
was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was pumping in a PK booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a phosphorus potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he actually had an excess of potassium
that caused calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was super because he was feeding
CalMag normally like he would.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, why do I have a calcium
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm feeding it in, it was because he
had excess of potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was worth mentioning at
this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right what you just said there too,
I won't dive too much into it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that is a question and something that
is brought up in the topics is like a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people are like, oh, should I not use
calcium magnesium toward the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to each is their own, an MPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're discussing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The K and the K is known for flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so right there, you were just saying
the potassium and the calcium are
[SPEAKER_01]: contraindicated in a sense at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when is calcium used?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is used.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is calcium out?
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't get into it, but calcium is an
immobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's used in the initial construction
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you get into the flowering process,
why do you need to construct more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, you need to allow the other
coenzymes to take place because at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point, the immobile nutrients,
you need other immobile nutrients to start
[SPEAKER_01]: doing their job in the plant, not the
calcium in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say I wasn't going to get
into it, but then we got into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium, I think magnesium is,
I love this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is one is where it was when
I, when I finally got my head around,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just like, okay, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chlorophyll reduction in the green
blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chlorophyll production is the green
blood of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to use certain terminology
that hopefully creates a connection to
[SPEAKER_01]: your soul in a sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have red, red blood, and then you
have green blood and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully you, you, you have a deeper
connection in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium gives the green color.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, the center of the chlorophyll
molecule is magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's jump over to the, uh,
to the magnesium molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have 55 carbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an organic compound,
72 hydrogens, another kind of compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: four nitrogens, another organic compound,
five oxygens, and then one magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just blown away by that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one, one molecule, it turns the ether
into reality where you can touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I'm fascinated with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, uh, so anyways, so, uh,
so phosphorus mobility, so it talks about
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus mobility and we already talked
about ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is also where an iron utilization,
we're going to get into that seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but phosphorus mobility and iron
utilization goes into the law of minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: and law of tolerance again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where when magnesium is able to do its job
with the chlorophyll, the ATP is able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is its function.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, we'll get into iron in a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fruiting and maturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to use a rock-based
magnesium supplement, uh, look for,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, Lingtonite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, potassium, sulfur, and
magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, right, this is how, this is how
these minerals are combined together in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally, that's where, again,
I'm fascinated with that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have these things in the nature is
like, okay, this is what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is everything you need for this
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can use Epsom salt, which is
magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of these will actually still help,
uh, help and they will not interfere with
[SPEAKER_01]: your microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get out and we're talking about the
different chemical structures,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's other chemical structures than
magnesium that the, that the chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: suppliers try to sell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, look to the back of the bottle
and look, uh, look at what type of Epsom
[SPEAKER_01]: salt or magnesium is in there and look at
magnesium EDTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's a new, that's another
chemical structure for an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium is a mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you going to look for the
deficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Older leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty, magnesium actually shows
up in, uh, as a secondary deficiency quite
[SPEAKER_01]: often.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I, in times, it was actually difficult
to find a really great magnesium only
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency, but I was able to find one
picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it normally will show up
with a calcium deficiency or something and
[SPEAKER_01]: then that's, or a sulfur deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you'll have different
products where it's a mag sulfur or
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium calcium product fused together.
[SPEAKER_00]: The magnesium sulfate can be used as a
foliar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll kind of hit your plant faster and
a sense of needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are coming across a mag
deficiency, consider magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sulfate as a, as a foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any, you know, that's where you get the,
we were talking about, we were talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the most unique thing about the
canning industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the, is we have developed an
inexpensive testing process to test the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are, are take time to actually go
back to the growers that are getting 4%
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes on the plan and ask them what
they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be able to identify you
know, their growing practices and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: should probably start to implement those
growing practices into large scale
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the terpene profiles, you only get
to, and I hate to use the word only,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to, and you can unsubscribe
to my channel because I used it,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the only way you're going to get to
the highest 4% terpenes and above that on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant went through the testing is with
all your micro microbiology going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plain and simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, all the, all the growers I have known
that I've gotten into the top 10 on the,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the, on the testing, on the,
on the different types of competitions out
[SPEAKER_01]: there when I've got an opportunity to talk
to them, they were all in the microbiology
[SPEAKER_01]: direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't just in the chemiside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, so let's go ahead and get into
iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron is for chlorophyll formation because
of ferritoxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ferritoxins are iron sulfate protein
found or peptide, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is iron, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, now we're talking about it
connected to mineral and organic
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to call it a protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: So iron sulfate protein found in the
chloroplasts, the site of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look at the picture where I'm
showing, where is it in the presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ferritoxins also play a role when
balancing the nitrogen and the,
[SPEAKER_01]: and reducing the sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then in the nitrogen fixation and
assimilation process is when iron and
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur, sulfur come together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're a minimum law of tolerance again.
[SPEAKER_01]: When balancing the equation in,
when balancing the equation, it increases
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen because when you balance the
equation with sulfur and nitric acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: the final math it, and I won't get into
the math, but basically what it means is
[SPEAKER_01]: you have one sulfur, six hydrogen,
six nitrogen and 18 oxygen molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why your oxygen content will
increase when adding in iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about a trace mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're making, if you're making
your, your, if you're using like the
[SPEAKER_01]: vortex thought process and you're
agitating your, or just putting a bubbler
[SPEAKER_01]: there and agitating your process,
we're talking about the oxygen carrying
[SPEAKER_01]: capability of your water even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by having the proper trace minerals
in your water, which I'm always talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about a product called Drops of Balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an, it has 34 plus trace minerals and
it's the foundation of sulfur of how all
[SPEAKER_01]: the minerals are placed and makes the
water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But going back to the slide, cell
division, and growth is because of
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is why I consider iron the father
and sulfur the mother is because you have
[SPEAKER_01]: cell division, which is, you know,
production, and then you have growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is the nurturing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how I'm able, I try to remember
the minerals and how I create a healthier
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with my plants and the,
you know, and the minerals that I'm using
[SPEAKER_01]: to feed my plants and then one day feed my
body.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tip, bone meal is a great source of
nitrogen and iron for soil growing because
[SPEAKER_01]: the bone, because the blood cells are the
exact same chemical makeup of chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: except the center molecule is iron.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's 55 carbons, 72 hydrogens,
four nitrogens, five oxygens, and one iron
[SPEAKER_01]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why bone meal has, has iron
supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron comes up and shows up as a,
at times as a sulfur deficiency and it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks at it, how I would encourage you to
look, look is at the tips of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll, at times you'll see green in
between the yellowing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once again, go to the PowerPoint
presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a really great example
and you're going to see within the leaf,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's spottiness, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see some really nice green
and then you're going to see the yellowing
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's not going to be like a nice flow
of lime green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, go to the, go to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see what I mean when you see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be able to identify it from that
point on.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing to mention that I want to add
particularly for new growers that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know this is new growth is going to start
as yellow and it's going to turn to green.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes, and I get this a lot with
beginners, they will, their lights will
[SPEAKER_00]: just come on for the day and then they'll
open up their tent and they'll look and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll see, Oh, I got a iron deficiency
or I have a sulfur deficiency because it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks kind of similar to where there's
yellowing starting at the base and then
[SPEAKER_00]: going up towards the tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they think that they have some sort of
deficiency when really like an hour or two
[SPEAKER_00]: hours later, all with a sudden the leaf is
green there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So new growth like overnight, for example,
when your lights are off, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: producing that chlorophyll to make the
leaves green and it just takes a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: hours for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just turn on your lights and
you see what looks to be an iron
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency, just remember that new growth
starts out as yellow and it should turn to
[SPEAKER_00]: green within a couple of hours or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we go, I love that you said
that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because the plant's growing faster
than what it can produce on other
[SPEAKER_01]: co-enzyme production, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, and because iron is a
semi-mobile nutrient, it's able to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: moving and keep to the newer growth as it
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what you're describing
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so benefits of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Formation of cell wall and cell membrane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Builds soil structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds soil structure when you use
seashells or bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give more marketing,
it's either seashell, if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: seashells, limestone, diatomaceous earth,
those are all the same exact thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, chalk, there's just different
marketing names to sell them under
[SPEAKER_01]: different industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, there's some binders and
different, look to how they're processing
[SPEAKER_01]: their material.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the key to getting a great source
of material of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: This feeds the microbes, which holds the
soil together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium nitrate is a synthesized chemical
that I actually would be fine using.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's NH03.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go back to the nitrogen,
if you go back to it and you see where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's dry from, it is limestone,
dry from nitric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so limestone, I'm good with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitric acid is the acid in the natural
nitrogen cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would use calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's actually brands I'm gonna
recommend into this video that have been
[SPEAKER_01]: very thoughtful around this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they're using synthetic
fertilizer, they're actually using
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer only in the natural pathway
that microbiology converts their stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, give you another example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium glucohatinate is a synthesized
chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will not feed microbes and in fact will
shut them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that calcium, that type of calcium is
actually in a number of bottles that you
[SPEAKER_01]: buy on your shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not gonna slander some of the
brands right now, but I want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, critical for activating certain
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law of minimum, law of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: TIP, use dolomite lime for soil to help
prevent calcium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is an immobile nutrient,
so look to the newer leaves to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies and excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium, we've all seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's yellowish brown irregular spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're gonna see it as the plant is
growing, is because it's immobile
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs that as the plant is growing and
it needs it dramatically less later into
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering is what we talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with the calcium is it,
again, it goes back to strong cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come across calcium deficiency in
flowering, you're gonna get some floppage.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's gonna be flopping over,
especially if it's got those big flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's happened to me before and it's not
fun to try to get them up for support,
[SPEAKER_00]: so calcium's super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just going along with what you're saying,
I grow coach clients literally all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world that this is all they got.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all they, it's for some reason
this is what they buy and I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: them to go buy more stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I look to the back of the bottles
and I look at the nitrogen they're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's urea or whatever,
this is when I would highly encourage them
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure to be adding in the calcium
because that plant's gonna be growing
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly and they need the other
fertilizers to do those other functions
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like we said, they're gonna get weak
stems or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as in grow coaching people,
it doesn't matter really how they're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always encourage them to go the
microbiology direction, but if they don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also tailoring them on their base
nutrients, how they're growing and other
[SPEAKER_01]: additives to use at certain times for very
specific reasons because of the chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So benefits of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I get incredibly
fascinated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I go through these slides,
you're gonna see that the enzyme,
[SPEAKER_01]: coenzyme reactions start increasing more
and more and more, but it's manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like how much manganese do we use and
why is it responsible for over 300
[SPEAKER_01]: coenzyme reactions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we not making it more significant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is again how we get to the high
higher health or potential of these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: is because as we get more into the trace
minerals, like all the foundation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, if you notice it is created for,
is to transport the trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why are we not putting more energy into
what the plant is actually asking for
[SPEAKER_01]: almost the entire time?
[SPEAKER_01]: So manganese aids in more than 300 enzymes
that regulate the human body and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law of minimum, law of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without manganese, chlorophyll cannot
capture sun energy for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capturing light.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Light is harmonic frequencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So magnesium is the receiver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants are listening to music all day
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Proof plants like music.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a correction, manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always switch these two.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do that again, we are on manganese,
not magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants interpret the music they are
listening to by the trace minerals
[SPEAKER_01]: activated with coenzymes designed with the
DNA, RNA code that are stored in the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to repeat this one more time
because I think this is so incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when light hits the leaves,
it creates a prism, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it reflects off, what is that
harmonic frequency?
[SPEAKER_01]: And minerals are gemstones.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are the prism that the light reflects
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your plant doesn't have all of the
trace minerals that you're capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: providing to the plant, that prism isn't
going to be a full spectrum in my
[SPEAKER_01]: viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the light intensity and all the
different types of light that come off the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun is crazy intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we only see this tiny, tiny little
speck of spectrum that we can see when
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the sun is actually like,
I don't know, let me go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that big, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we only see this little mount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm always thinking, you know,
with all these trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the plant capable of capturing all
these other, a number of other light
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrums that the sun emits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the sun wouldn't emit those
spectrums onto our earth if it wasn't for
[SPEAKER_01]: a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm not trying to get into
religion or any of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do in some level think that we're in
this divine system that is created for us
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything has a purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single time someone tries to
dismiss us or dismiss our reason for being
[SPEAKER_01]: as just being random, I don't even want to
talk to that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever, not whatever, but you know my
point, moving on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder what phosphorus, and this is my
point to this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is I wonder what phosphorus and calcium
sound like to microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trace minerals actually play a larger role
than what we are led to believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever talked about
emotive work on water and holding energy?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emotive work on water is all about
capturing the energy that we emit off of
[SPEAKER_01]: our bodies when we're saying love or we're
saying hate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the water actually has the ability to
capture that energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he does is he says these words or
he plays certain music right when the
[SPEAKER_01]: water is going to the freezing point and
then he looks at the water underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope and he's shown over the last
two decades all the different crystalline
[SPEAKER_01]: structures that the water forms through
different energy we emit off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not to go too far into our ancient
history, but the waterways in India all
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the world actually in the stone
structures where they're having water
[SPEAKER_01]: going through all these pathways allow a
lot of these ancient structures actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have words like love or appreciation going
through their waterways which is very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So minerals are electrons, protons,
and neutrons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we admit that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we agree to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so Buddha said we can experience 108
human characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Characteristics being emotions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Emotions are energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hypothesis is that there is one mineral
associated with every human emotion we're
[SPEAKER_01]: capable of interpreting on this human
plane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my theory is that there is 108 total
organic compounds slash minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as our technology gets more sensitive
we'll be able to discover them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we're roughly around the 90
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to manganese.
[SPEAKER_01]: So manganese is an immobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So look to the newer leaves for
deficiencies and excess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Manganese, one of the best ways I think it
is very often I think people will be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I'm dealing with the calcium
deficiency, but it's different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the spots appear different on the
leaf than a calcium deficiency in my
[SPEAKER_01]: viewpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just slightly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at the picture you're
going to see exactly what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh yeah, I noticed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely mistaken a lot for calcium
deficiency, that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come across manganese deficiency just
a small handful of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, one time in particular that
I can remember is being cocoa and my pH
[SPEAKER_00]: was a little bit too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have those pH ranges where
nutrients are uptake and at different pH
[SPEAKER_00]: ranges and it was just out of that range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I saw manganese deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this picture I think is pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely looking at this,
you can kind of see that there is a clear
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between this and calcium
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because yeah, there's like a little bit of
yellowing in there as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And just what you're saying also,
I've actually noticed this deficiency come
[SPEAKER_01]: up more when using the Foxfarm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to slander it, but again,
this line is around the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made at least 30 videos on Foxfarm
and you can read all the threads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a couple of growers that wanted to
use up their nutrients ran to this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that being said, let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, moving on to the next one,
which is copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Benefit is copper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So copper is a metabolic catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it actually helps speed things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all a catalyst is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps the catalyst of photosynthesis
and the respiratory and that is why it
[SPEAKER_01]: increases sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is where a lot of the
industry thinks that sugars is part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they think that they want to provide
sugars to increase the taste and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually not how you increase the taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add in more cane sugar and other
stuff, you're jacking up your bacteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're shutting down your fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also goes back into the law of
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually how I actually know if
the nutrient line knows what they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is when I see them saying higher turps or
something like that and I turn to the back
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bottle and they have copper in
there, I'm like, okay, this nutrient line
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of knows what they're talking about
because copper aids in enzyme production.
[SPEAKER_01]: All bacteria are capable of producing
different coenzymes for every mineral that
[SPEAKER_01]: exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have billions of bacteria,
millions of fungi and all those bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: can produce different coenzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do copper enzymes do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They intensify color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with more minerals that become
bioavailable, more of the music can be
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreted by the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It improves flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flavor equals terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because with these specific coenzymes,
your plant can now produce a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copper is a semi mobile nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to appear in the newer
before the older and it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: distinguishable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you'll know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this picture, they're even going
through a nitrogen deficiency with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, because of how fake the
green is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when you look at the flower
development, it is underdeveloped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm probably looking at a seven-weeker
right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mean nitrogen toxicity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not deficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned before, the dark green
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can see the outer edges
yellowing to the chlorosis there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't cover all of the essential
nutrients here in this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely want to save it for our part
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the audience demands it, if you demand
a part two audience, we'd love to have you
[SPEAKER_00]: comment in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know you want a part two because
we've, I think a little bit less than half
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of sunshower nutrients we
covered today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, we could really do a part two
and cover potentially the remaining amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of essential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want a part two, let us know
down in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to what do you got next?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the solution to the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the one product I would
actually say it will be, is a game
[SPEAKER_01]: changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can almost guarantee you will not find
another product like this in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've heard that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm to guarantee you, you will
probably not find this product out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: $25,000 have went into verifying the
science of what this product does and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: called drops the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll go back to the law of minimum
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It states that the growth is dictated not
by the total resource available,
[SPEAKER_01]: but by the scarcest resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we already gave the example,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have all the minerals,
but if you don't have water, your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing goes with the trace of
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we have the basics, water,
light, all those other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is going to create more coenzyme
reactions, even if you're not using
[SPEAKER_01]: microbiology and it goes into the trace
minerals, the things that people are not
[SPEAKER_01]: discussing because the science isn't there
really to, and the technology isn't there
[SPEAKER_01]: to create sense of enough technology to
actually identify the minerals and their
[SPEAKER_01]: compositions.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The science actually is we, Japan is 15
years, 20 years ahead of us on water
[SPEAKER_01]: science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So drops the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Drops the balance is 34 plus negative
ionic trace minerals, sulfated trace
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cleans over 2,500 plus man-made
chemicals, so it reverts them back to
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfated minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's at a four ml rate for drinking
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to talk to you guys clearly if
you're going to use this for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at a rate of one ml per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me say it again, for growing is at
a rate of one ml per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the eight ounce bottle will be good for
240 gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 16 is 480 and the 32 ounce is good for
1,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, let's go into the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Law of tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: The law stating that the abundance or
distribution of an orgasm can be
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled by certain factors where if
levels of these exceed the maximum or
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum limits of tolerance of that
orgasm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, going back over into the
chart, I circled just a couple of the ones
[SPEAKER_01]: we covered today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at all the other ones we didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just a very small list of the
minerals that we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can actually create a part two,
three, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where I want to put a lot of
my energy next year into.
[SPEAKER_01]: The approved brands by Perfect Gardens is
Guy Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love their processing, how they extract,
they're thoughtful around what they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like their brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth Dust, nectar of the gods,
down to earth, drops the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: NPK nutrients raw if you're into
hydroponics, recharge, extreme gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a great product on extreme
gardening, the Azos and the Mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're simple to use, throw it in,
and I've always got great products off of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, there's a few other lines that I
do like, but for now, I think that's about
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Mark, you were really the first
person in this podcast to put together a
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of details.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is going to be a viewer
favorite for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for your efforts there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us, where can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can find me definitely at
YouTube at perfectgardens.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: My goal is to get to one grower at a time
and seed their mind with healthy thoughts
[SPEAKER_01]: on growing practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really not putting my attention to
large scale anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the wrong direction of this
industry and where it's going.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think because of the collapse and
all the land that's going to become
[SPEAKER_01]: available, I think the best place where I
could put my time is with a one-on-one
[SPEAKER_01]: basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also find me on perfectgardens.com
where you can buy some of the materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to, not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also hit me up at admin.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do want consulting on a larger
scale, I do offer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just am very selective with the
corporations and where I put my energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: time to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, please like, share, and subscribe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super helpful, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have made 400 videos up and a fourth of
them, no, even more than that,
[SPEAKER_01]: are demonetized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I genuinely enjoy giving away the free
information because I don't have to get
[SPEAKER_01]: caught up on trying to sell stuff to
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Took the words out of my mouth as far as
liking it, subscribing, if you haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Mark's YouTube
channel down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if you're on Apple Podcasts,
Spotify, leave a rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming up to 100 ratings and review,
or actually I think we just passed 100
[SPEAKER_00]: ratings and reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everyone who has left a
rating and review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget to share this podcast.

can share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you to everyone who shares this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark, once again, thank you for coming

[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I'm gonna be
watching over and over again because the
[SPEAKER_00]: information here, there's just,
there's so much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, hope you enjoy the rest of your
day.
