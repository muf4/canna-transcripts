[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk...
[SPEAKER_00]: My goal with organics is to keep the
medium moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the microbes are continuing to be
active if the soil dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get that breakdown of those
amendments turning them into usable
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little sponge at the bottom and a little
container there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically wet the sponge and then
keep it on the bottom rack there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps hold the proper humidity in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix it up within the top inch or so of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much like glass shards to
these pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards the end of flowering, I'll lower
the temps in order to try to conserve the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have less terpenes volatizing off the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get caught up in the noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a million ways to go about
growing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some content creators out there
that say it's their way or the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the best way to do it and
everybody else is doing things wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just so far from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the Garden Talk podcast this episode
100.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I'm joined with Dakota
from HomeGrow TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not interviewing him this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually interviewing me for this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that's actually been
requested by a large handful of you over
[SPEAKER_00]: the past two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured episode 100, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we get into a variety of
different gardening topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about my grow style, plant
nutrition, environment, plant training,
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, and more.

[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different series LED grow
lights, the Ion Board and the Ion Grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ion Board fixtures are board style and
use Samsung LM301B diodes, while the Ion
[SPEAKER_00]: Grid series has an open center design and
uses Samsung LM301H diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: these grow lights and the discount code
MRGROWIT15 works on both Amazon and their
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I invited my friend Dakota here from
HomeGrow TV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'm the one getting interviewed.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up, brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, what an honor to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the 100th episode of Garden Talk
with Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, 100th episode, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just say I appreciate your
willingness to do this, to come on and
[SPEAKER_00]: interview me for a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't familiar with Dakota's work,
I definitely recommend you check him out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just amazing cinematography.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the best, if not the best on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love your work,
including myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to his channel
down in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll hand this off to you,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You fire off some questions at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, this is sick, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, it's about time because it's
been 100 episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we got you behind, you know,
in the interview seat and we got some
[SPEAKER_02]: questions lined up for you, brother,
to go through and kind of figure out who
[SPEAKER_02]: is Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's Chris, your history, what got you to
the point where you are here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get into those questions,
bro, I kind of wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the purpose or what brought this
episode up for the 100th episode,
[SPEAKER_02]: me interviewing you on your channel?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was actually viewer requested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over, you know, the past couple of
years since I've been doing this podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's been a large handful of people
that are like, Hey, how about you get
[SPEAKER_00]: interviewed for an episode?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I thought about it,
you know, I agreed to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, I wasn't sure when I wanted to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I figured, Hey, 100th episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a perfect timing to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as bringing you on,
there was a few people who I had in mind
[SPEAKER_00]: for actually being the one to interview
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about like interviewing myself,
but I'm like, ah, it's going to be bland.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me, let me bring somebody else on to
ask me questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we did an episode together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget what episode that was,
but look back, you'll see the episode with
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also did a live stream on your
channel and both of those, I feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: just flowed so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we have real good chemistry and
yeah, I think it, I think you would be one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the best, if not the best person to ask
the questions, follow up questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that stuff to kind of get the most out
of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, much love and thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I could throw it back, if there's
anyone I could sit down to interview,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially on their channel, it's most
certainly Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, like you've made such an impact on
all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to the podcast that we're
now listening to right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I say we jump right into it,
brother, because we got a lot to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, again, this is the moment
where we actually get to know Chris,
[SPEAKER_02]: the man behind the Mr. Grow It channel and
obviously the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first question, brother,
tell us a little bit about how you got
[SPEAKER_02]: into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit about me and how I got into
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born and raised outside of Boston,
Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little town about 15 minutes north of
Boston called Bilrica, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my first memory of gardening was
actually with my grandparents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember being out in the garden and
picking carrots, baby carrots with them
[SPEAKER_00]: and washing them off and eating them and
them tasting so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rest in peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither one of my grandparents on that
side of the family are with us anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a memory that I'm going to have
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only carrots, but they had
lettuce, some peppers, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a full blown garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was my first memory ever of me
gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I was about 14 or 15,
that's when I was consuming at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started consuming when I was 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 14 or 15 years old, we never
really started researching on how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't attempt it yet, but I was on the
forums researching, trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to do it because I was tired of
spending money on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, oh, grow my own, you know what
I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started researching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it wasn't until I was like 15 or
16 when I started my first grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And me and my buddies, we went out deep
into the woods and there was a stream and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was like moist soil next to the
stream and sun was on that spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, it's got to be a good spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this sun, it's moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's plant the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full gorilla grow style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jorge Cervantes would be proud,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we planted that, came back months later
and there's like tall spindly plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: like no buds on them, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no idea what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so laughable looking back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, and then we just abandoned it
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really in 2007 to 2009, that's when my
friends started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had indoor grows, outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember seeing the Fox farm
nutrients bottles for the first time and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, these are cool logos.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you, these are nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, how often do you feed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just picking my friend's brain
on how to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started my first grow in 2010.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I grew, it was like skunk
number one, NY city diesel, strawberry
[SPEAKER_00]: cough, and I think Northern lights,
if I remember correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's, that's how I first got
started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unreal bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just touching on like what you just
said out of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those like line up classic strains,
which are so classic now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was one of those first ones that
stood out to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like from the Northern lights,
the strawberry cough and those,
[SPEAKER_02]: was there one like of that first gardener,
you know, young Chris, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: is the first garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was there one that stood out to you right
up, right off the bat?
[SPEAKER_00]: It had to be the skunk number one,
just because of the smell was just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so skunky, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that that it's in its name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just super powerful smell and
flavor as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everything that he used to cross with
it in the future, that strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: I get where you're coming from on that
one, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where you started.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously like gorilla grow style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many of us got our start with like
really growing and eventually like getting
[SPEAKER_02]: our own set up into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like from then till now, like what's,
what kind of like Sal, are you working
[SPEAKER_02]: with now with your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, back then when I kind of first
started growing, I was using the Fox farm
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean forest soil, a Fox farm tree of
nutrients and HID lighting, which is what
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends were using, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So might as well, you know, get mentored
by them, do what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they were doing it successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember with the HID lighting back
then, man, it was like, I had the cool
[SPEAKER_00]: tubes and wing reflectors came after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that air cooled hood,
which I'm probably speaking another
[SPEAKER_00]: language for a lot of the newer girls out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what the heck is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the cool tube was like a tube
when you had like a, it was like six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: reflectors, I think on each side or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the wing reflectors, this big
wing, and then the air cold were game
[SPEAKER_00]: changers because you had the ducting
connected and it was just pulling the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I started with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I switched over to LEDs in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first LED, I don't think I'll ever
forget it, is the platinum LED P9XML2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good light for back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still selling that light today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked online recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like not the best company, you know,
selling older technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're also selling like therapy
lights now, which I thought was so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like platinum LED therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, like what are people using these
therapy lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't look too deep into it,
but they switched from indoor grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: to therapy lights, which I thought was
pretty funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Fox Farm Nutrients,
they got some really good results with
[SPEAKER_00]: that lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it for, you know, five,
six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also was using the Beastie Blooms,
which is their PK booster, because
[SPEAKER_00]: oftentimes I would get phosphorous
deficiency in the middle of flowering and
[SPEAKER_00]: that PK booster did help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I switched over to the LED
grow lights, I had added CalMag into my
[SPEAKER_00]: regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I started there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of where I'm going now,
I mean, I'm fully over with LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been using, I've used so many LED
grow lights over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, I can't even remember them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I'm using the AC Infinity T24s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two of those and I have two T22s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've used Viprospector in the past,
Mars Hydro, Spider Farmer, the list goes
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually doing PAR testing for a
while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had companies send me lights and I would
test them out and show with a PAR meter
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were doing for PAR numbers and
posting videos on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got bored of that and stopped doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did have an interest in lighting for
quite some time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as medium, you know,
I've tried Coco in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some really great results with it,
but I really still prefer growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have transitioned over to organic,
but I still do synthetic grows or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to be politically correct for a
lot of people, there's mineral based grows
[SPEAKER_00]: from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, my main focus in recent years
has been growing organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we continue, because like,
again, we're talking to someone right now
[SPEAKER_02]: guys that has spoken to so many experts,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a hundred episodes on the
channel with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only imagine how many more experts
you've spoken to, again, going to MJBizCon
[SPEAKER_02]: and different place in different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how much of what you've learned from
the very beginning as a grower,
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, at the very beginning to,
again, your grow style that you've kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: explained to us now, how much of your
interviews and the experts that you've
[SPEAKER_02]: known have molded that compared to you
just making your own decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it's hard to explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done so much stuff differently since
talking to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I remember when you would hear
about when the leaves, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pluck off leaves or leaves fall off and
it's at the top of the soil, people saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to immediately remove those
leaves from the top of the medium because
[SPEAKER_00]: it attracts pests and, you know,
come to find out fast forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, organic growers, they do that
purposely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the chop and drop method.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're chopping things down, dropping it
onto the soil is a mulch to help retain
[SPEAKER_00]: the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, that breaks down and microbes break
it down, cycle the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant can uptake those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, I mean, an endless amount of
things that I used to do that I've changed
[SPEAKER_00]: because of what I learned through talking
with people, you know, watching YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: videos or talking with people on my
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's always changing,
always trying to improve when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: what I do in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that must be the battle with you and
me as an active listener to the podcast
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, oh my God, one week we might be
talking more organics and the next week
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about maybe synthetics and
you're talking about everything on the
[SPEAKER_02]: scale, which you as like a grower yourself
as well, you must have internal battles
[SPEAKER_02]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so my, my question is like,
when you hear someone again, like Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce Bugbee, someone with so much
certification coming on your show and
[SPEAKER_02]: telling you this are the studies that's
what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you take these professionals and their
advice as like, that's law.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you taking this as like, I'm going to
test this and then apply it and continue
[SPEAKER_02]: to use it with your own personal stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely take into consideration and I
say them as a source when I'm talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: other people about what they have
discussed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but science is repeatable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there might be one study on it,
but there needs to be more studies on it
[SPEAKER_00]: in order for it to be proven as a fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just keep that in mind because I know
for example, there's a study on flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and people are, you know,
there's this one study and people are
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, okay, this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fact, yet there's only been one
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be multiple studies on it
doing with the same result, repeatable,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in order for it to really say that
this works or this doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Dr. Bruce Bugbee, I mean,
he's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a lot of things that he says he's
done studies on, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: Utah State University, a big shout out to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually attending Utah State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my second year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a part of his, uh, cultivation
certificate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he has going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it last year and then I'm taking it
again this year, but so much good
[SPEAKER_00]: information on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only own so much on YouTube,
but actual formal schooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can learn so much more, especially
when it comes down to the nitty-gritty
[SPEAKER_00]: science of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I really enjoy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for everybody, but certainly I
enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, good for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially like looking up and
watching different channels on YouTube or
[SPEAKER_02]: podcasts on, on whatever platform you
listen to podcasts on for listening to the
[SPEAKER_02]: people that like, in this case,
you, Mr. Growett, Chris, for him to be
[SPEAKER_02]: putting in the work and going and like
getting these certificates to better your
[SPEAKER_02]: knowledge, to better handle the interviews
that you're doing, pulling different
[SPEAKER_02]: experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that's why, that's why I've been a
subscriber for a long time, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really cool to hear this from
this side of the desk, like actually
[SPEAKER_02]: getting to ask you, um, flipping it a
little bit because you've spoken to so
[SPEAKER_02]: many experts.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've, you know, obviously it been
implementing so many different things and
[SPEAKER_02]: testing, but you probably still have your
own preferences when it comes to auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers or photo period.
[SPEAKER_02]: So which one do you prefer and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've grown, uh, I started growing autos
in like 2015 and I've grown about probably
[SPEAKER_00]: two dozen or so, maybe a little bit more
auto flowers since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do prefer photo period for a
few different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, more control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can veg the plants for as long as I
want, flip the flower when it's the size I
[SPEAKER_00]: want or the shape I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and I can delay flowering if I come
across any problems, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a deficiency or maybe I have a pest
infestation that I want to deal with first
[SPEAKER_00]: before flipping over the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the control off of photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, um, my lights being on
less.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being on a 12, 12 light cycle and the
plants are in flowering, I prefer more
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly because it works well with my
climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live in a very dry climate,
very hot climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the desert actually, and I run my
lights at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it usually comes on about 6 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the 12 hour light cycle at 6 AM.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in some areas you actually get a
benefit of lower energy cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think in my state that's the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different state by state,
but as far as it being cooler at night and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, when you have your grow rooms on
it heats up that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I running my lights during the
day, unfortunately it makes it more
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult to control that heat and you
know, temperatures rise up into the high
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's touched 90 degrees before.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grow tent, which is really not ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can keep my lights off during the
day, I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see that as a benefit for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely prefer photo period for
those few reasons, mostly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not blame you as a gardener.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to control as many things as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they're starting to flower is
definitely one of an important one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there we have a guy's photo period on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to photo period,
are you more of a feminized guy or a
[SPEAKER_02]: regular seed guy and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to say feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for the peace of mind purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly grow from seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clones I've done in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I don't do a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: In between grows, there's a period of
downtime where I'm drying, caring and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any active plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mostly grow from seeds and I grow all
different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The max plant count I have here is 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quite recently actually within the past
year or two, I planted 12 regular seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and I veged them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did get them DNA sex tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out the result probably like week
three or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it wasn't too much time wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But out of those 12 regular seeds I
planted, only four of them ended up being
[SPEAKER_00]: female.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to kill off the remainder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like luck of the draw wasn't a really
good ratio for male female, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: throws everything off for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just having like a peace of mind with
feminized seeds, that's just my personal
[SPEAKER_00]: preference really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially I guess like if you're planning
for to fill up a four by four,
[SPEAKER_02]: four by eight, or whatever it is for your
plant limits, and especially talking plant
[SPEAKER_02]: limits, some of these are gonna be males.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're not looking to get into
breeding, I totally get where you're
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And have similar experience, dude,
on the last one with my regular run.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't talk about it here or now,
but at some point I gotta fill you in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm definitely sticking to the FEMS too
and I agree with you on that one,
[SPEAKER_02]: brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Chris, talk to us about
proper plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you actually do with your plants
to keep them nice and healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it really depends on what I'm using
for an input.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can break it down between synthetic
or mineral based grows, and then I'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about organics after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the synthetic bottled nutrients
that I use, typically I'll go in at a half
[SPEAKER_00]: dose to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times I grow in a soil that
has nutrients already in it to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's already pre-charged with
nutrients, a lot of people say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically for the first roughly 30 or
40 days of the plant's life, it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: enough nutrition in the medium already to
begin, particularly in soil is what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't do any feedings for the first
30, 40 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there I'll start doing a
half dose of bottled nutrients according
[SPEAKER_00]: to what it says on the feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to stick to the ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know if there's an imbalance of
nutrients in the medium, it could lock out
[SPEAKER_00]: other nutrients, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do stick with a half dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do the, there's so many
different ways to go about it and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done it so many different ways,
but I typically stick to the water feed,
[SPEAKER_00]: water feed technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where when I feed, the next time
the medium dries out, I will water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next time the medium dries out,
I'll feed and then I repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I determine when to water,
it's just old school technique that I
[SPEAKER_00]: still do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started from the beginning and still do
to this day, which is just stick your
[SPEAKER_00]: finger in the top of the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If an inch down, knuckle deep,
if there's bone dry, that's when I go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there with the watering or feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also lifting the side of the grow pot
and checking the weight and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I don't use moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that probably, probably should.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that makes things a little bit
easier, but as of right now, I don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically it with synthetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as organic, I mostly use
the organic blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will do an initial amending of the
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my recent favorites have been the
build a soil craft blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before I even plant into the medium,
I will amend in the build a soil craft
[SPEAKER_00]: blend, one cup per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then roughly about 30 days into the
grow, I'll do another top dressing,
[SPEAKER_00]: another 30 days, do another top dressing,
repeat that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically it, just kind of
water in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with watering, I do treat it
differently than with synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't let it dry out between waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it moist throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time I will do the 5% rule,
which is you take the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: container and mostly use a seven gallon
grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be transitioning up to a 10
gallon grow pot for organic, but seven
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons, so 5% of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would water that in every two,
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many factors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Size of the plant, size of the container,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my goal with organic is to keep the
medium moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the microbes are continuing to be
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil dries out, microbes go
dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get that breakdown of those
amendments, turning them into usable
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that the medium is moist,
is one of my main goals with organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's definitely for those of us
listening right now, that's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: worthy of note taking right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially for some of us getting into
our first few grows, that note alone is
[SPEAKER_02]: something for me that took a little bit to
understand the benefits and the
[SPEAKER_02]: disadvantages to not keeping it moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, well said on that one,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talking about the environment,
what kind of conditions are you aiming for
[SPEAKER_02]: in your environment when it comes to the
humidity, heat and all that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, when I first started
growing indoors, I didn't realize how much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a pain it was going to be to balance
the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, what a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Easier said than done for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll break it down one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So temperature, we'll start with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically what I aim for is 82 degrees
Fahrenheit at the highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown, you know, years in the past,
85, 87, as high as 87 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_00]: in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some cultivars can take it no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others clearly struggle off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found 82 degrees Fahrenheit to be ideal
for most cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been sticking with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then towards the end of flowering,
particularly weeks, you know, six,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven and beyond, depending on how many
weeks that cultivar is, I'll lower the
[SPEAKER_00]: temps in order to try to conserve the
terpenes, have less terpenes volatizing
[SPEAKER_00]: off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trick that I got from Dr. Bruce Baugu,
talking about him a little bit earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I take away from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, lowering that temp down to about
70 degrees Fahrenheit in the final weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowering is what I do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not for it to be more than a 15
degree swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, sometimes it will be in the low
60s Fahrenheit when the lights are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, towards the end of flowering,
I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if we're in veg or the beginning or
middle of flowering, I'll try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: that, those temps up around 70,
the lights off temp around 70 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do go after VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, according to the Pulse VPD
charts, there's so many freaking VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: charts on the internet, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes things so confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, oh, I'm going off the VPD
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, which VPD chart?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's so many that are different
than other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been going off the Pulse Monitor VPD
charts that they have on their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, for example, if I'm at 82 degrees
Fahrenheit, which is what I run,
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for about 60 to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the green to dark green range on
the on their chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in flowering at 82 degrees
Fahrenheit, it's between 52 and 62%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's again in the dark green to the
light green range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get too nitpicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are like,
oh, it needs to be in the dark green
[SPEAKER_00]: range, which is the most ideal range.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes into the light green range on
the chart, I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's perfectly fine, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, you know,
I do have to add in a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, right now, it's 30% humidity
just in this room right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's average for where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, in the wintertime,
it gets lower, it gets into the teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always adding in humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, chapped lips, just dry everything,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got humidifiers going nonstop then
inside the tents or do you have them
[SPEAKER_02]: outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a two by four tent and a four by
four tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one in each of those and I have one
just in my long room as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps, right, to make sure that
the air coming into the grow tent is of
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been helpful for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as CO2, I don't want to
skip over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried so much in the past for CO2,
particularly the canisters, TMB natural
[SPEAKER_00]: canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried the mushroom bags in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those did pretty good jobs at
raising the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a CO2 monitor, so I'm actually able
to see whether or not it's working and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's never consistent,
but it does, raise it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be 600, 700, 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been up to 1200 ppm of CO2 using
those methods, but even not using those
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just me exhaling the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in the same house that I live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend lives here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three cats live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We exhale CO2 and the air coming into my
grow space is coming from my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking at my CO2 monitor and seeing
it at 800 ppm, not doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementation, I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a small home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just growing for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to maximize yield at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, I just want to get a harvest,
just want to get sufficient harvest off of
[SPEAKER_00]: each plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been okay for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I no longer do the supplementation CO2,
but I've done a lot in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then air circulation, I guess that
that's a part of the environment too,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, you know, the oscillating fans
have a couple of those on 24 seven and
[SPEAKER_00]: they have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You typically they're positioned above the
canopy and below the canopy or through the
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make sure that air is getting through
the canopy sufficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I haven't had any issues with
the powdery mildew on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have a certain brand of,
of clip fans or fans like to use big fans
[SPEAKER_02]: inside the tents or using small clip fans
or like what's your, your recommendation
[SPEAKER_02]: there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's a whole nother thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me as a grower as well that, I mean,
I almost started a fire like a month and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was like some Chinese fan that I
had running 24 seven just sitting in the
[SPEAKER_02]: corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me to you like ask you,
is there any preferences or for growers
[SPEAKER_02]: that you would recommend for us to be
using as far as like circulation inside
[SPEAKER_02]: the room?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really been liking those AC infinity
oscillating fans on that clip on the side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've really gone a hundred percent of that
in the past though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they can be pretty pricey in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've used a small, um, I believe the
brand is homes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's a nine inch oscillating
fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a bunch of those in the grow
tents in the past in my grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used a 12 inch fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I not remembering the name of this
brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of the most popular brands
of oscillating fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, there was a 12 inch one I would
use in my grow room back when I was just
[SPEAKER_00]: in an open grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had it in a four by four for a
little, for a few grows and it was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: an overkill to have that big of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, these days I highly recommend
those AC infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're nine inch, I believe nine
inch oscillating fans that clip onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: side of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it wasn't until I seen the fire that I
almost started that I hopped on and
[SPEAKER_02]: started looking at the solutions and I
seen they were one of the only ones that
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't using like little computer fans or
like the little desk fans and then just
[SPEAKER_02]: remodeling them to grow fans, but they
actually designed something for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, for me, especially here is
it's a big topic is getting that
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation right in the amount of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that other company that you're
mentioning, that wasn't a grow company,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Homes now homes is, uh, they make all
sorts of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they also make like, uh,
air purification systems and stuff like
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So another good solution to check out for,
for those of us looking for good,
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation on the inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what about training the plants,
bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, you've spoken to so many people
with different techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do when it comes to training
your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing, man, where I've done
so much over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun to be able to manipulate these
plants and see how they grow differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I'll start with topping,
topping the plant is something I do almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every single grow is I'll top the plant
and you know, I used to do, I used to let
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant grow up to the fifth node,
top down to the third node.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then keep those lower branches to grow up
and widen out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've topped at the fourth node and kept
the lower branches to grow up,
[SPEAKER_00]: come top to the fifth node, kept the lower
branches to grow up these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have some squattier plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll just maybe do one top on other
plants that have longer inner nodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow more stretchier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'll top multiple times.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really all depends on growth,
but most of the time I'm topping at the
[SPEAKER_00]: fourth or fifth node, letting those side
branches grow out, adding in some low
[SPEAKER_00]: stress training, doing that on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes I'll do additional tops
on those branches that came out and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, I've topped again and topped again
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a whole bunch of branches,
but I typically like to have about eight
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes 16 main branches coming up
is typically what I aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then doing low stress training on top
of it, low stress training with every
[SPEAKER_00]: single plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just kind of keep it somewhat
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have those garden clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those green garden clips, clip onto the
side of the grow pot, use regular the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden ties, kind of look like the bread
ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just like snap it off however long
you want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just like a little wire, boom,
bread ties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: He nailed it on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you use these as well for training
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pulling the branches down, using that
to secure them down to the side of the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm at a fabric pot, I use a safety pin
to pierce the side of the grow pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but still use using those garden ties in
order to pull the branches down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just basic low stress training
techniques there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then super cropping is the other
training thing that I do once in a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mostly do super cropping when the branch
is more in the center of the plant and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really bend it down with low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just super crop those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes like when I'm going to scrog
net, for example, and I have some branches
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up taller than others,
I'll super crop them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really only the two times that I
actually utilize super cropping.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as like when it comes to
lollipopping and defoliation, like what's
[SPEAKER_02]: your process or your strategy there?
[SPEAKER_00]: So for lollipopping, I'll typically try to
do it, typically push it off until like
[SPEAKER_00]: the first few weeks in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes if there's a lack of air flow,
I'll do it in veg, but it's usually either
[SPEAKER_00]: week one or week two in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly sometimes week three of flowering,
I will remove the lower third,
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes the lower fourth of the plant
and completely strip everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of talked about this a little
bit earlier, but I take the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've trimmed off, whether it be small
branches that aren't going to reach the
[SPEAKER_00]: top or leaves, and I'll cut them up or
I'll just, you know, leaves, I'll just let
[SPEAKER_00]: them lay flat down onto the medium now,
you know, chop and drop style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that turns into a mulch layer,
which helps with the moisture retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I've been doing recently
for lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then defoliating, I typically will do
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to push it off the first three
weeks of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll do it towards the end of
veg, you know, especially with the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: air flow in the center of the canopy
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll do it on either day one or
day seven or as late as day 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I typically like to do it is I
will remove the leaves more towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking kind of top down,
the middle of the plant, I'm removing
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves kind of almost down towards the
entire bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do like to leave a lot of the outer
leaves on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the outside edge of the plants,
particularly on the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I call it the skirt technique is something
that, you know, keeping those larger fan
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves on the bottom of the plant around
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of looks like a skirt,
particularly because I feel like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in the past when I was coming
across deficiencies quite a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly when using synthetic bottle
nutrients, I'd get that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency where people know that,
you know, textbook style, you see that the
[SPEAKER_00]: start the bottom of the plant and start at
the tip of the leaves and work its way up
[SPEAKER_00]: towards the petiole.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I keep those bottom leaves on the
plant, I'm able to identify that
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm able to make adjustments,
you know, add in feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is still something I do today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that for many,
many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I will look towards the end
of flowering, you know, day 45,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's like an eight week or sometimes a
little bit later than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is some leaves covering the bud
sites, I'll look to try to tuck those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves first, but if I can't, then I'll do
the removal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, and for those like who might be
listening, it might be the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: growing or just getting into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How important is lollipopping,
defoliation or training your plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that you personally do
every single time with every plant or are
[SPEAKER_02]: you just kind of doing it when you have
time?
[SPEAKER_00]: For the lollipopping, I do it for every
plant in order to try to remove that larf
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes in the bottom buds that are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are some cultivars that are
going to dents up all the way down to the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider that like, you know,
being lucky a little bit to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar that's like that to where those
bottom buds aren't larf at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually hard buds that are
usable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a lot of cultivars, it ends up
being larf and nobody likes trimming larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ends up in my trim pile and I use it
for oil and butter and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every single grow I do lollipopping and
then for defoliation, there are grows
[SPEAKER_00]: where just some cultivars you don't need
to, like I don't need to, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: more like longer inner nodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flow isn't impacted throughout the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find myself doing very little
defoliation, if at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it really depends on growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the cultivar, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you ran the ocean fruit
before, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The ocean fruit from Square One?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm running that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I have one that is like
finally one that isn't like larfy buds in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that I should have chopped off is
like looking decent, but...
[SPEAKER_00]: The Square One genetics, yeah,
they dense up all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had their frozen fuel and also their
brisker OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Denses up all the way down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's just some cultivars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think this ocean fruit has
brisker OG in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might be what I'm seeing,
but towards the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did a lollipop, but it was the
bottom quarter instead of a whole third,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I'm glad I kept some of those,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're even photo-worthy, some of these,
which I got the photo shoot in the next
[SPEAKER_02]: few days on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incredible genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do for pest prevention?
[SPEAKER_02]: Living where you live and the experience
that you have, what kind of pests do you
[SPEAKER_02]: have to deal with and what have you
learned as far as pest prevention?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since I mostly grow indoors,
I've done a couple outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have vegetables outdoors,
but particularly talking indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been fortunate enough to not come
across many pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main pest that I've come across is
fungus gnats, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come across white flies before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't come across spider mites before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the rhips or russus mites,
anything major like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aphids I've had outside, but as far as
indoors, fungus gnats is used as the
[SPEAKER_00]: number one thing I'm battling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a couple things I do to prevent pests,
diatomaceous earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using that past couple years,
actually, last year, two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way I use it is similar to a way a
lot of people use it, is they'll mix it up
[SPEAKER_00]: within the top inch or so of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it said that diatomaceous earth,
it's pretty much like glass shards to the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of these pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And particularly when the larva is
hatching and they're trying to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: above the soil, they're getting hurt off
it and they're dying off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use yellow stickies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not really a pest preventative,
but more to identify the pests there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a yellow sticky in every grow
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can identify if there are any gnats
flying around, and then I can make
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments from there if I need to spray
the plant for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to spray every single week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to spray peppermint, then the next
week it would be rosemary, then the next
[SPEAKER_00]: week it would be neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would do that as IPM, as a
preventative.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were cycling with three different
types of preventative, and why were you
[SPEAKER_02]: cycling with three different ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it said that the pest gets used to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just doing peppermint every
single week, then the pests get used to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, then they won't actually deter the
pests as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rotating it is said to be beneficial
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, basically just mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water into a sprayer, and then add in a
teaspoon of Dr. Bronner soap as a
[SPEAKER_00]: surfactant, and then a bunch of drops of
peppermint or rosemary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people do five drops,
some people do 20 drops of each of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neem oil, you can just follow the
instructions on the bottle type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I typically do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then spray in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically I used to spray every week,
but I avoid that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm only doing it as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically I'll do it once before
flipping the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do a nice spray of the plant,
then flip over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really use the peppermint
rosemary neem as much as I do now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth can control, so I'm not sure if
you've heard of that product, but that
[SPEAKER_00]: also has oils in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a thyme oil and corn oil mostly,
and there's some other ingredients in
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I found that very effective not only
to battle the fungus gnats, but also as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So spraying that before flipping the
flower has been a bit of an official on
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or using the amazing Dr. Zymes Eliminator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's another thing that can
battle pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an infestation, it helps with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some people use it as a preventative
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing a spray in veg before flipping
the flower is typically what I'll do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then last thing I want to mention is
that textbook thing is not to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: directly outdoors, indoors, into your
indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll typically, if I come from
outdoors, I'll change the clothes,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and then go into my indoor
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what we need to do, Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point, we got to get Adidas
tracksuits designed out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that should be like, you know,
we come in from outside, we put our Adidas
[SPEAKER_02]: tracksuit on, and we go see the ladies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long term, what I'm thinking for a good
IPM.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, great points on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single thing through preventative
all the way through to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so how do you go about harvesting,
drying, and curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I look at the trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to harvesting, I usually aim
for mostly cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really pay too much attention to
how much amber there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people will aim for,
you know, 10% amber, 20% amber,
[SPEAKER_00]: 30% amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make their decision off of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm mostly, I'm looking at mostly cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to see minimal clear trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I'll harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll cut the plant at the base of the
stalk and hang the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically dry in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been kind of my go-to is drying in
a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be a full by four or a two by
four, depending on the number of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have an oscillating fan at the
bottom of the tent circulating air around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure that that oscillating fan
doesn't, isn't pointed up towards the
[SPEAKER_00]: buds, because that dries out the buds a
little bit quicker than desired,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a very dry climate, so I always
have a humidifier to add in humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for 60% RH at a 60 degree Fahrenheit
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, unfortunately, I usually can't get as
low as 60 degree Fahrenheit temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually about 65.
[SPEAKER_00]: 65 to 68 is what I can usually get it down
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, ideally it would be 60-60,
but I can't get it to that every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually dries for about 7 to 10 days,
roughly, for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for curing, I have been curing
for many, many years in glass mason jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, typical one ounce of bud in
a 32 ounce jar, wide malt mason jar,
[SPEAKER_00]: have a little hygrometer in there so I can
see what the temperature and RH is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I aim for around 62 in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's like 64 or above, I'm taking the
buds out of the jar and kind of letting
[SPEAKER_00]: them dry a little bit more before putting
it back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing the typical burping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like I've talked about this
on my channel so much that I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: how detailed I want to get here on this
podcast episode, but at least daily
[SPEAKER_00]: burping for at least the first few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is what I aim for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently picked up those Grove bags,
which are really a hot product these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are ditching the mason
jars and they're going after the Grove
[SPEAKER_00]: bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I picked up some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't used them that much for curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm super excited now, is I actually
picked up one of those Canada Trolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you heard about what
those ones are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, what's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man, dude, it's like, I'm so excited
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw them at MJBizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what it is, is it's about
the size of a mini fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it controls both temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's for drying, curing, and storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can adjust the settings on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freaking game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: So literally, I'm so excited to harvest
next because I'm not going to have to dry
[SPEAKER_00]: in a grow tent anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put in my Canada Troll,
which holds up to 2.2 pounds, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: more than enough for me, and put it in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Set it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boop, boop, boop.
[SPEAKER_00]: To what I want for a drying temperature
and drying RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually goes by dew point that shows
the humidity there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it'll dry for a certain period of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you switch it over to the curing
settings or storage settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So huge game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a bunch of stuff in there right
now for storage and it's holding steady.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has like a little sponge at the bottom
and a little container there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you basically wet the sponge and then
keep it on the bottom rack there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that helps hold the proper humidity in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it's nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so, so pumped to have this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your next, like in the future with your
harvest, you're not going to be like hang
[SPEAKER_02]: drying full plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to be cutting it up and then
drying inside this little mini fridge
[SPEAKER_02]: style build.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the name one more time for us just for
the first time hearing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the name again on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada Troll, like a little troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: C-A-N-M-A-T-R-O-L.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually trying to, I reached out to
them to try to get like a discount code
[SPEAKER_00]: for my audience and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're going to give me
one, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to email them after this and I'm
going to be like, look, I was just talking
[SPEAKER_02]: to Mr. Growit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I heard the rumors that somehow
this is like the new solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a discount code and please tie it
to Mr. Growit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you were the one that let me know
about this amazing invention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're expensive though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 1600 I think is the price tag on
them right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus shipping or maybe there's free
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saving one harvest though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like you can make that money back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've lost harvest to mold
before, you know, we're high made it here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've lost harvest in the past and I
feel like saving one or two or hitting a
[SPEAKER_02]: perfect cure would pay itself off after
like two or three harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think it's worth the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I spent the money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we move on, I just had one quick
question and we don't have to take too
[SPEAKER_02]: long on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the first harvest you explained
to me about or the first time you were
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, what was your harvest processed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Curing and drying process like back then
compared to now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what was your first time like drying
and harvesting?
[SPEAKER_02]: What were you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh ma'am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made my first successful grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, I just had it in a closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was hang drying similar,
you know, I was cutting it at the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and hanging the whole plant
upside down with the clothes hanger,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, and just leaving it in the
closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was no, I wasn't using a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't temperature control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wasn't doing any of that and I
was probably losing a ton of terpenes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but back then nobody really
focused on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least my group of friends didn't really
focus on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just let the plant dry to what it was
going to dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even have those hygrometers for
the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we weren't controlling whether or not
the humidity was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably had mold for all we know,
you know, in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so much different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're doing so much,
I'm doing so much more now in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that I don't get mold during the
drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And curing process because it's,
it's so easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it happen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's so easy to get if your
conditions aren't right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get it, it's hard to go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning it's going to happen again and
again on every harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, you make sure you tackle those
problems at the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really well said as far as those tips
and tricks, because is it fair to say that
[SPEAKER_02]: your, your process, what you're doing
right now for curing harvesting and is,
[SPEAKER_02]: is making a difference on the flavors
compared to back in the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's, there's been,
there's a huge change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially with conserving the
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people make this fake and
it took me many, many years to really
[SPEAKER_00]: realize this is curing isn't the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The storage comes after it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, oh, well you're, when you're
storage, you're still curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to, not going to fight
that battle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're, when you're curing and
storing it, a lot of people ignore the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature, the storage temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I spent so long just having stuff
out in the open, it being 75, 80 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: just in my room and the storage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be in the dark, but still like
the, the, the, the bud Brown's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker than the stuff in proper storage
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people will do 60 degrees
Fahrenheit upwards of 68 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: Fahrenheit as their storage temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, doing that, I actually have some
bud here that you can clearly see the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: that was in a temperature controlled
environment versus a non-temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment, a higher
temperature than the temperature control
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clearly see browning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The browning of the bud happens within the
first two, three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could see a clear difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people, again,
ignore the fact of their storage
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and their, their bud is
deteriorating a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the RH or moisture
content, my opinion, the more dryer it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more harsher it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had somebody debate me on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going to say, I'm going to say
that for everybody's opinion, but I feel
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's the drier it is, the more
crumbly it gets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just harsh on my throat at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure that the RH is around that
62% has, has been a game changer for me
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good call.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, definitely a very important
piece to everything, all the work that
[SPEAKER_02]: we've done as a grower to get to this
part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely something we should be paying
attention to and focusing on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most certainly listening to Chris and
what he's doing, cause you've proven the
[SPEAKER_02]: results and you've talked to a lot of
experts on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those people listening to this
podcast right now, or maybe even tuned in
[SPEAKER_02]: watching the YouTube version of it and
they're beginner growers, Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, what is a message that you would
like to, or some type of advice maybe that
[SPEAKER_02]: you like to give for beginner growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know I have a large handful of
beginner growers that tune into my
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be, got to be well over 50%,
50, 60, 70% or, or, you know, within their
[SPEAKER_00]: first year or two, you know, so advice I
think, you know, I'll keep it pretty broad
[SPEAKER_00]: here is don't get caught up in the noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a million ways to go about
growing these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some content creators out there
that say it's their way or the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the best way to do it and
everybody else is doing things wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just so far from the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different ways to grow
this plant successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try out different ways, you know,
experiment, have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't just one way to do it,
to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other ways to go about it are just
alternate ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, most of the time you're getting to
the same ending there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't get caught up in the noise and
don't think that you know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's, there's the comment,
you probably get the comments too in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comment section where it's like,
I've been going for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know everything, you know, it's like,
no, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still scientists don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still identifying things about this
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a never ending knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing I love so much about
gardening, growing plants is that it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: endless amount of things that you can
learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I just, for me,
I just push myself to continue to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: and continue to try things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes things a lot fun for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's the advice I have for,
for beginners out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause then after that, you take that
seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the rest kind of just starts to make
sense, you know, after like stopping,
[SPEAKER_02]: like stopping, complicating everything,
listening to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one is the most beneficial thing we
could all be doing, but yeah, do not
[SPEAKER_02]: overcomplicate the things.
[SPEAKER_02]: One big question.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's for me and a lot of people that
have been tuning in to your show over,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, how long has this show been
going forward now, by the way,
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast, two years, just, just,
just passing the two year mark here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: So two years, two years since this sucker
started, it feels like we've been hanging
[SPEAKER_02]: out for 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're best buddies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of times that I've listened to
you on the podcast and all your guests,
[SPEAKER_02]: but for all of us viewers, listeners,
what does the future look like for this
[SPEAKER_02]: garden talk podcast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to make some changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I feel like doing the same thing
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always looking to improve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the a hundredth episode here,
I think it's about time to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: changes to try to make things better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting in the next episode,
I'm not going to spoil it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there will be a new intro coming up in
all future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to simplify things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent so long getting caught up in the
length of the episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, it's got to be 45 minutes
to 60 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been guests that I've gone
longer with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get some good information about out of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been some episodes that have
been shorter than that 45 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there have been some episodes where I
kind of just, let's say forced the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation, but like I could have ended
the conversation sooner, but just try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more out of it and you know,
expanding on more on a topic than needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I'm not going to shy away from
shorter episodes moving forward,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if there's a 20 minute episode
on a topic, I'm going to be okay with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I actually got that advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give a shout out to my girlfriend
who has all she does is listen to podcasts
[SPEAKER_00]: all day long while she's working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how she does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't listen to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have something else on my ears while I'm
trying to do something, but she can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I got this advice from her
where she's like, look at this on this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is an hour and a half long
episode, but this next one's only 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they needed to cover is 20
minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to be more open to not really
caring much about the actual length of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a long list of guests lined up for
the future that I'm super, super excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, you know, one last thing is I
want to ensure that the guest is bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable, valuable information to the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing a better vetting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a couple of guests where I
wish they had more to bring to the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the, the, the past of the past,
you know, you don't really know somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: until you start talking to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just doing my due diligence,
researching somebody, maybe having a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation with them before I agree to
have them on the podcast to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's structured and the information being
brought out is going to be valuable for my
[SPEAKER_00]: audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to waste my audience time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is everybody's time is valuable and
it sucks when you're tuned into something.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, wait, why am I watching this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or why am I even listening?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really getting much out of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, click out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then move on to something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't want it to be like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, definitely have some changes
coming upcoming in the future on the
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about, and, uh, you just have
to stay tuned in and check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I most certainly will be, and I hope
everyone listening right now will be as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such amazing work done in the last two
years, you know, and to hear what's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: in the future is exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love where you're going to go is,
and if you don't want to share it totally
[SPEAKER_02]: fine, but is there any way you can give us
maybe a few people coming out next year as
[SPEAKER_02]: some interviews that we could get excited
about or something, throw some names out
[SPEAKER_02]: there if not totally fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, well, you know, I, I hate to put you
on the spot by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I typically don't like naming guests
that I plan to have on in the future
[SPEAKER_00]: without already having it filmed because
I've made the mistake in the past of
[SPEAKER_00]: saying people's names.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Oh, I'm going to get this,
this person agreed to come on the podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually never came on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm a little bummed out by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for this purpose, I will name a couple
of people who I'm pretty confident will
[SPEAKER_00]: come on here, which is Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him at MJ BizCon.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's huge amount of knowledge he has with
both growing and Coco and LED grows in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to pick his brain on both of
those topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not filmed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we do film it and get that
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jordan river from the grow cast podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing a lot of soil courses with
the queen of the sun grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been traveling around doing those
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really want to pick his brain on
pretty much like soil science building,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, your native soil using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a couple that I have off top of
my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Ted Hussey recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't asked him to come on the
podcast, but I will be asking him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he comes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe y'all can head on over to his like
social media and be like, Hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should come on the garden talk
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll get him to come on
potentially, but it takes a few of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: To let them know that we want to hear them
on the podcast and we might get them on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then repeat guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely want to get some folks
back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we can get you back on the podcast
at some point to do some more,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do another talk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm not going to shy away from
repeat guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started having some folks on for a
second time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to flood the channel with
repeat guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe one repeat guest a month or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still trying to figure that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go with the flow type stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, but yeah, definitely want to get
some of these other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get Dr. Bruce Bugby back on,
that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get Jeremy Silva from Build a Soil
on, that'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some folks where really I want to
do a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to continue that conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me as a viewer as well, I already know
I have my list of part twos that I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have no doubt that this year coming
up and everything you have lined up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to hit every single one of
those and probably more just like you have
[SPEAKER_02]: year to year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've blown us away as far as people
listening to your show, watching your
[SPEAKER_02]: show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Chris, how else can the listeners find
you and what else do you have coming up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can search Mr. Grow It on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find two of my channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is just called Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my gardening channel where I show my
plants and then garden talk with Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the name of my other channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where my podcast is on and podcast
clips, Q&A videos, some unboxing videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dig way back, you'll find the part
test videos on that channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Stash podcast on YouTube and all
podcast platforms at mr.growit on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, watch out for impersonator
accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only Instagram account I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: All other are fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like five or six fake
accounts, which Instagram is just horrible
[SPEAKER_00]: when it comes to impersonator accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell anything through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody reaches out to you with an
account that looks like mine and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking you to send them money,
don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Mr. Grow It on Twitter, Mr. Grow It on
Facebook, mrgrowit.com and fromthestash
[SPEAKER_00]: .com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you can find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the future I'm working on my
second book.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hope to have that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should be out this year at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually delayed for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some family health issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to travel back home and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad is battling cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was diagnosed last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spread to his other lung.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually spread to his brain and they
gave him one month to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's on hold until I could
spend the final days with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're good.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't expecting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, nor was I.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's big news, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other than that, keep an eye out for
the weekly podcast episodes on my garden
[SPEAKER_00]: talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to do more podcast clips as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have those on my YouTube channel and then
gardening videos on my main channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keep an eye out for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I'd love to see those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shorts rolling out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we're thinking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the interviews maybe in shorts,
maybe some of that cut up into smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: bite sized content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shorts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I need to do that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's try to get some of those on to all
social media, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody likes to listen to full
length podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so much good information in
these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking that information, cut them out
on a smaller little bite sized chunks and
[SPEAKER_00]: then posting them on the channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that'll be valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is technically a wrap.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's our interview, Mr. Growit aka
Chris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bro, what an honor it has been to share
this 100th episode with you, brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thankful that you decided to come on
and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this went pretty smooth,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of good question that you
asked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I'm ready to be getting to the
other questions for the next interview.
[SPEAKER_02]: At some point we're going to collab,
whether it's on my channel, whether on
[SPEAKER_02]: yours, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having me and
congratulations to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone listening, throw down a comment,
throw down a like, whatever it is you're
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to this on for Mr. Growit,
for Chris and this podcast and the vision
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're doing for us growers,
for us to learn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this, bro, I respect you, honestly,
and thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your kind words there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks to everyone that have tuned
into the podcast over the past 100
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a journey and I never thought
that I would be a podcaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to do one on one
discussion videos with growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually turned into a podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I got approached by a couple
other guys to be on another podcast called
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I never thought I'd be a podcaster,
but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enjoyable and definitely excited for
the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll definitely keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys haven't followed him,
head on over his channel, follow him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've got a ton of really good
quality videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cinematography is next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed to harvest videos are crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I heard is that you're going to
transition more to the documentary style
[SPEAKER_00]: things, which is going to be really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have a link to Dakota's channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in the YouTube description section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Much love brother.
