[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the GrowCraft X3 LED grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by Chilltech.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over this light and in this
video I'm going to do a PAR test and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: also going to do a heat test on this light
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did a video where I unboxed the
unit and talked about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: features.
[SPEAKER_00]: That video is on my main channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see what comes in the box
and want to know what features this light
[SPEAKER_00]: has, I'll link that video in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the description section will be a
link to this grow light so you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: listing and I'll show a discount code down
there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers and the measurements are in
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's any light being emitted from
this fixture outside of that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to show on this meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're new to this channel,
these PAR tests I do just to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking measurements in a grove tent
and the reflective walls could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the PAR numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light has a flowering
coverage area of two foot by four foot and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking measurements in a two foot by
four foot grove tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I take the measurements, I'll make
sure the dimmer is set to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged the grow light into my kilowatt
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at the amps and watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the light fully dimmed and it shows
0.25.
[SPEAKER_00]: 24 amps and 25.6 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now full power, 2.66 amps,
324 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, now let's get into the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that a link to this LED
grow light is in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below along with the discount code.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
