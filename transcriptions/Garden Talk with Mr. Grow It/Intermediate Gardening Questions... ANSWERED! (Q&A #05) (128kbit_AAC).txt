[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm back with another Q&A video.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around I decided to do
intermediate questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of you may see the questions that
are in this video and think to yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is more of a beginner question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me, I do have beginner questions in
a separate category.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones I felt like they're more
intermediate questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might disagree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, this will be the
intermediate questions Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a beginner questions Q&A and
also an advanced questions Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have any questions that you want
me to potentially answer in a future
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, please leave them down in the
comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do get a ton of questions in the comment
section, so I certainly can't guarantee
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm going to answer every question
that's asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the questions,
I just want to give a quick shout out to
[SPEAKER_00]: our sponsor for this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mars Hi Joe for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over their FC4800 LED grow
light and this thing looks pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 2016 total diodes consisting of
Samsung LM301B and Osram 660nm diodes and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're powered by an Inventronics driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls 480 watts from the wall,
covers a 4 foot by 4 foot grow space,
[SPEAKER_00]: and has an efficiency of 2.8 micromoles
per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a dimmer on it so you can
adjust the power output and it's daisy
[SPEAKER_00]: chainable up to 15 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like the bar style design
which helps provide an even light spread
[SPEAKER_00]: across the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Mars Hi Joe website
down in the description section below and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can also use coupon code MRGROWIT for
a discount on any of their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting close to harvest, should I do a 48
hour blackout before harvest for better
[SPEAKER_00]: results or is it just a myth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there's actually any
scientific studies on the 48 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness before harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there actually is a study out there and
somebody knows of it, please leave it down
[SPEAKER_00]: in the comment section below so I can read
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things that we do know about this is,
you know, number one is that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: secondary metabolites are produced during
lights off period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So secondary metabolites, that includes
resin, the trichomes, that's produced
[SPEAKER_00]: during lights off period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's all thought process behind it is
give your plants 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do 72 hours of complete
darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the plant can't produce those
secondary metabolites, the extra resin or
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome production and then from there
you would harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as of right now I guess we can chalk it
up as bro science until actual science
[SPEAKER_00]: comes out behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know there are some youtubers out
there that have done their own individual
[SPEAKER_00]: studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lostleaf, I believe is one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can search for his name on YouTube and
he did a 48 hour darkness study,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually took tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did THC test results for a plant that
was 48 hours of darkness and one that was
[SPEAKER_00]: not done with 48 hours of darkness and he
did see a slight difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to check that out to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there's other youtubers out
there, other people who have done their
[SPEAKER_00]: own individual studies and reported their
findings on whether or not 48 hours of
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness worked for them or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is about organic amendment
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand their instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, after using them and doing a lot
of research, I found that although the
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizers sound great, it's hard to
determine when the nutrients will be plant
[SPEAKER_00]: ready, mineralized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think going to a single amendments,
bone meal, fish meal, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: is better for my conditions than the
premixed versions, bio live, bloom,
[SPEAKER_00]: boost?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, where is a good place I can
find recommendations?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly do individual amendments
instead of doing the blends.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blends are just one way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The individual amendments are a different
way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're going to go the individual
amendment route, I highly recommend you go
[SPEAKER_00]: by a soil mix or method that has been
tried and works.
[SPEAKER_00]: A great place where you can find
recommendations is build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So build a soil dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a resources section in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have three different soil
recipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a ton of people that use those
recipes with success.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you really want to go by the individual
amendments, maybe check out build a soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if they have certain ratios that you
need to go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if your ratios get out of whack,
you may see deficiencies in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nutrients can lock out other
nutrients, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something I seem to always struggle with
those calcium deficiencies in transition
[SPEAKER_00]: and flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't seem to ever get it 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would enjoy if you touched on that
specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So calcium deficiency is one of the most
common deficiencies out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in soil, a lot of folks,
what they'll do is they'll add in Cal Mag
[SPEAKER_00]: every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll add it in along with their base
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're mixing it with water,
Cal Mag first, then base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on watering days where you're
supposed to feed water only, some people
[SPEAKER_00]: also do Cal Mag on those days as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be what you're missing is
just not feeding Cal Mag in on watering
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be causing the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Cocoa Coir, most growers do
feed Cal Mag every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as dosage, five to 10 milliliters
per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe is what the back of most bottles
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do a half dose,
at least in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really have to do a half dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a full dose of Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know one of the mistakes that a lot of
beginners make is they'll do half the dose
[SPEAKER_00]: because they always hear about half dose
of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually for base nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additives such as Cal Mag, you can do a
full dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing if you're struggling with
calcium deficiency, particularly also if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing in soil, is staying above
6.2 pH provides with a little bit better
[SPEAKER_00]: of calcium uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you reuse soil that has bottled
nutrients if you really try to wash or
[SPEAKER_00]: flush it out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Short answer is yes, you can reuse that
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it before where I've flushed out
the nutrients in a previous soil that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had used bottled nutrients on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I flushed it, reused that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did come across some deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you're doing that,
you're risking your nutrient ratio kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: being out of whack and some nutrients
getting locked out because there's excess
[SPEAKER_00]: of other nutrients Now when I did actually
reuse soil that I had used bottled
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in on a previous grow,
I did actually take that soil and send in
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil sample to Logan Labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I found on that soil sample
report was it was high in sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was probably one of the
reasons why I was seeing issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me personally, I really don't like
to reuse soil that I've used synthetic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of growers out there,
I feel like a majority of the growers will
[SPEAKER_00]: actually just toss out that soil and start
fresh just because there is that risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's definitely frustrating when
you're trying to get through a grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden you see deficiencies
popped up and you're scrambling,
[SPEAKER_00]: have to flush the plant and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just it can be a little bit easier
if you're just using fresh soil each time
[SPEAKER_00]: when using synthetic bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a waste, but it can be easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you tell if the strain you're
growing is legit strain to be a mother
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that really comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you're growing out a plant
and you get into the flowering stage and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really like how that plant looks,
some of the characteristics that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for, whether it be frost
production, the colors, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth, and you want to keep that strain
around, you can actually clone it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Re-veget that's called monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be done and that can be taken and
used as a mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people instead of doing that,
they'll actually cut clones while it's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetation stage still and they'll
keep those plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when they get into flowering,
if they like that plant, they'll keep
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones around and continue to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll use one of those as a mother
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if they don't like that plant that
they're flowering, they'll just dispose of
[SPEAKER_00]: those clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people cut the clones prior,
so they have them just in case they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others will do that monster cropping
process and bring it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as how to tell if your strain
is good enough to be a mother plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: any photoperiod plant can be turned into a
mother plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about auto flower
plants, those are in a limited lifespan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you definitely keep auto flower plants
as mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like earth dust products and do
you add anything else to it when using it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually struggled using earth dust
at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, over the years I've gotten the
hang of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually do like using earth dust
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would start in larger containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was starting in like three gallon
containers, five gallon containers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and sometimes it's a struggle compared to
if you're using a larger container,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I'm using now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using a seven gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 gallon containers or even larger than
that when they're growing with organic
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients or living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things I add with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recharge is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any microbes are going to be good to add
in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root Magic by Blue Planet Nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to add into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Teas more so in the flowering stage is
when I'll add teas in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're either just a nutrient tea or with
earth dust products, you can actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: two tablespoons per plant, which I think
is what Dan from the Green Sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: Company recommends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings, you know, high quality worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be added just about at any point
throughout the grow or can be put into
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also like to use molasses as
well, both as a soil drench, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly in flowering stage, and also as a
food source in my teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it okay to use flavored Epsom salts
than just plain Epsom salt if you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: find it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salt is magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend getting a Epsom salt
that doesn't have any additives in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just look in the back of the
directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for 100% magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what additional additives are
in the Epsom salt that you're looking at,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's probably not good in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about growing at a low
20 to 30 RH during the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will it make my buds more dense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really low humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: RH stands for relative humidity for those
that don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That low humidity goes against VPD,
vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you may have heard of that and not
really know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a low humidity like that,
VPD actually increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going to happen there is the
stomata on your plant's leaves are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it gets smaller, CO2 uptake reduces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also as the VPD increases, transpiration
increases as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As transpiration increases, roots pull in
more nutrients, which could actually lead
[SPEAKER_00]: to a toxicity issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, if you have a lot of plant
available nitrogen in the medium and your
[SPEAKER_00]: transpiration increases, the plant's
intaking more of that nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could lead to a nitrogen toxicity
that's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: With me before, it's happened to a lot of
people that have posted on my forum
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's somewhat common for those that are
running low humidity like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overall running a lower humidity like
that and the plant will still grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not ideal and it does cause more
stress on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer your question on whether or not
it makes the buds more dense, in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, it actually makes the buds
more airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might've just been the cultivars I was
growing, but yeah, I usually have a better
[SPEAKER_00]: result as far as bud structure when I'm in
the proper humidity range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rule of thumb is two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a larger pile, I was actually
talking to an outdoor grower quite
[SPEAKER_00]: recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says that for large piles that he's
growing outdoors, he actually waits 16 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 days, I believe he said, which is very
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're a small indoor grower,
two, three weeks is general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not really sure if you're talking
about how many books I've written or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about how many grow books
that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll quickly show you what books I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of you have seen me mention this
one before.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Jorge Savante's Grower's Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was 2006, I think is his edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some outdated things in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, there's a whole bunch of good
information in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do really enjoy this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: True Living Organics by The Rev.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my go-to for organic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't gotten through this one entirely,
skipped around it quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely need to sit through and read
this thing from cover to cover still.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, really good stuff if you're
growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal's Handbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually used at Oakster Dam
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that I've just kind of browsed
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is like a textbook here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A ton of good information in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ed Rosenthal is a legend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's really heavy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Grill Bible, super thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how many pages is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: 636, so almost 700 pages in this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by Greg Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, a whole wealth of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely haven't read this from cover
to cover yet, but maybe someday.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Emperor Wears No Clothes by Jack
Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people mispronounce his name,
Jack Herrera.
[SPEAKER_00]: According to him, it's Jack Herrera,
rhymes with terror.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the 14th edition of this book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Haven't cracked into it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the previous edition and have
browsed through it a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, still need to read this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have The Beginner's Guide from Danny
Danko.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is a pretty good read.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of general information in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did read this from cover to cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my book right here, Complete
Beginner's Guide for Growing Indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just to talk a little bit more about
this, this is really for the complete
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had a couple people buy this and
they have, you know, two, three years
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and like, oh, I knew almost all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really more geared towards if
you're just starting out your first or
[SPEAKER_00]: second grow and you need kind of a
walkthrough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of general information in order
just to get you through that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more that can be said about
the growing process beyond this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, Complete Beginner's.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is available on Amazon only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link it down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It covers both soil and cocoa coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you do end up buying it on Amazon,
please leave a review.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would greatly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get up to 500 reviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm at like 220 reviews so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got quite a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost halfway there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if everybody out there that had
purchase the book, if you're able to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a review on Amazon or rating, I think a
star rating, I would greatly appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am working on another book,
which I hope to have released by either
[SPEAKER_00]: late this year, the end of this year or
early next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably more early next year,
but I've definitely been making a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of progress on it so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And books take a while, especially the
research side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, having more hands on
experience is some things I want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some hands on experience on and then write
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a process, but I'm super excited
about this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to bring a lot of
value.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to reveal what it's about
just yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time gets closer, I will give away
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another giveaway for you all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: First off, we've got the set of rope
ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by Vivo Sun or Vivo Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I might have been pronouncing it
wrong this entire time and they never
[SPEAKER_00]: corrected me on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'll continue to say Vivo Sun
could be Vivo Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pair of rope ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some protective glasses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are, I believe they're the green
lens specifically for the Blurple style
[SPEAKER_00]: lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got an indoor, outdoor digital hygrometer
and aluminum clamp lamp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are really good for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do is click the link down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take you over to
Rafflecopter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a few ways that you can enter
the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
I'll see you in the next one.
