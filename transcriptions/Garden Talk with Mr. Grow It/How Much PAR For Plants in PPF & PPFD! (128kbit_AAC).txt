[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a topic video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one was requested by a viewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants me to talk about PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video, I'm going to talk about
PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk about what the optimal PAR
levels are for growing plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also I'll talk about PPF and PPFD,
which are measurements of PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, what is PAR?
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR stands for photosynthetically active
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the energy that your plants use in
order to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light emitted from the grow light are
photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of them as little balls of energy
falling down onto your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course your plant takes those
photons and uses them for the
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much PAR does your plants need?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of different measurements
that you can look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF is the first thing that you can look
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPF stands for photosynthetic photon flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what that is, is the total light
output that a fixture emits.
[SPEAKER_00]: When growers are shopping for grow lights,
and I often get people hitting me up
[SPEAKER_00]: asking me which grow lights to buy,
one of the things I recommend them to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at is the PPF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there is such thing as giving your
plants too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course you don't want to be in a
situation when you're not giving your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants enough light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So making sure the grow light you're
looking to buy has enough PPF for that
[SPEAKER_00]: grow space is important in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the optimal PPF levels for
growing plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really varies depending on what
plant you're looking to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The chart I'm about to show you right now
are the optimal levels for growing MJ
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're growing some other type of
plants such as like leafy greens,
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, bok choy, spinach, things like
that, you won't need as intense PPF levels
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm about to show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the screen right now I'm showing the
PPF levels which are optimal for MJ
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this list from Eric from LED Grow
Light Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually part of their LED Buyers
Checklist, and it's one of the top things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are mentioned on the checklist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see here, if you're in a
five foot by five foot area, around 1,500
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per second PPF is sufficient
for that grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 1,100 to 1,500 micromoles per
second PPF for a four foot by four foot
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 600 to 850 micromoles per second
PPF is going to be sufficient for a three
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by three foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around 275 to 375 micromoles per
second PPF is going to be good for a two
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by two foot area.
[SPEAKER_00]: These PPF numbers are just a general
guideline.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody may reply in the comment section
and say that they go after different PPF
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of the things you can look
at when you're shopping for an LED Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now unfortunately not all Grow Light
listings are going to have a PPF number.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some manufacturers just don't post a PPF
number.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they do, bonus, you have something to
go by.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then you're kind of out of luck
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that on LED Grow Light Depot
website most of the listings seem to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a PPF number, which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: LED Grow Light Depot is one of the
companies that I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a link down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have some of the top lights,
some of the best lights for growing MJ
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you're trying to buy a light off of
Amazon, most of those lights unfortunately
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't going to list PPF data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those listings that don't show PPF
data, something else you can look at is
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD stands for Photosynthetic Photon Flux
Density.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what that is is a spot
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to tell you in a particular
spot what is the power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the screen right now I'll show you what
the optimal PPFD measurements are for MJ
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going by the light that is
actually hitting your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the optimal levels for seedlings,
clones, and mother plants are between 200
[SPEAKER_00]: and 400 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the vegetation stage, it's optimal to
hit your plants with 400 to 600 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the flowering stage, 600 to 900 PPFD is
optimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these numbers are without
supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're supplementing CO2 in your grow
room, you can increase these numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go for higher PAR numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the PPF numbers that I showed
you, these PPFD numbers are just general
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody might comment on this video and
say that they go after different PPFD
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are a ton of other things that
we can talk about when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do just want to keep this video to PAR
PPF PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any other topics that you
want me to cover that relate to lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a quick update on what's
upcoming on this channel, the next video
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to actually hit you with a PAR
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a viewer recommend a particular grow
light that he wanted to see a PAR test
[SPEAKER_00]: done on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I reached out to that company and
actually got them to send me a light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be coming up next and then
the video after that will be another Q&A
[SPEAKER_00]: video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't already hit that
subscribe button and click the bell to be
[SPEAKER_00]: notified when I release a new video.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
