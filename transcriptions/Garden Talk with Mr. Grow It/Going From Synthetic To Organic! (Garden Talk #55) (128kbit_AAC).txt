[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone had a pretty good base mix and
had used some synthetic nutrients in it a
[SPEAKER_01]: time or two, they could probably still
turn that into a living soil environment
[SPEAKER_01]: over a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes will remediate quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll remediate just about anything
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything really from the ocean is going to
be salty and possibly contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also like planting stuff like carrots
and radishes and things that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrate the soil and feed everything in
the soil or below the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality is absolutely higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more research you do up front and the
more prepared you are going into that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation, the better your turnout is
going to be for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow-It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast this episode
number 55.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview James from
Red Dirt Raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been gardening for his entire life
and he currently runs a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, he talks about several
different things such as transitioning
[SPEAKER_00]: from synthetic to organic, ferments,
water soluble mineral inputs, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AAC Infinity for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over their Grow-Tent,
which has a canvas density of 2000D,
[SPEAKER_00]: making them the thickest Grow-Tent on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an aluminum plate that mounts your
controller to the Grow-Tent with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof pass-through for cable routing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frame has 50% thicker steel poles and
carries two times more weight than the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard Grow-Tents.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with James from Red Dirt
Raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excited to talk to you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about a whole bunch of
things that I think are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable to the audience listening in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about transitioning
from synthetics to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also going to get into things such
as ferments, water-soluble mineral inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: cover crops, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, before we get into those
things, what we'd like to do is an
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is James.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the owner of Red Dirt Raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a small family ran medicinal plant
farm in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started it in 2019 and have been
gardening all my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other types of plants, vegetables,
house plants, but have been commercially
[SPEAKER_01]: farming in Oklahoma since 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you started out with synthetics,
and then you transitioned over to
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what we're going to talk
about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before talking about the transition and
how to go about it, general question here,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I know the answer, but I think it's
important for the audience to know the
[SPEAKER_00]: answer as well, which is why make the
change from synthetic to organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it was all about quality
initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've tasted the difference in an
organically grown tomato compared to what
[SPEAKER_01]: you may go buy at the grocery store,
you'll know immediately the flavor is
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bit stronger in that organically
grown tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing goes for medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality is absolutely higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see a more diverse terpene
profile, higher cannabinoid content
[SPEAKER_01]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, a lot of it had to do with
sustainability, being able to provide your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants with the food they need instead of
using a bottle, using something from the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth, or maybe even a ferment or
something that you have made there
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a number of reasons for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're running a farm commercially,
the bottom line is always going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: steer decisions, and overhead on any size
farm isn't small.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was another really attractive selling
point for me, trying to choose what
[SPEAKER_01]: direction we were going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all started with quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've had organically grown medicinal
plants, you know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: One major thing you mentioned is
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, there are pros and cons to
growing both ways, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sustainability really stands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going out and spending money on nutrients
every single round can be expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly save money going the
organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a reason why folks
transition to the organic side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can save a significant amount
of money if you do things right,
[SPEAKER_00]: transitioning over to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of my audience are home growers,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in containers, they maybe buy a
bag soil, then they're starting to use
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, what they're doing is throwing
out that medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're throwing out after they finish
their grow, they're usually throwing out
[SPEAKER_00]: that soil and then buying a new bag of
soil starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reason why is because things such as salt
buildup can occur, which can, once you
[SPEAKER_00]: plant your next crop, you could
potentially, you're at higher risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: running into issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there can be a nutrient imbalance
over time that can happen within the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're out on a farm, so there's no
throwing away the soil and starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've already used synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to use that same soil in order to
transition to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the steps to go about
transitioning from synthetic to organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on scale, there's a few factors
there that are going to, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: really line out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the steps for people?
[SPEAKER_01]: For a tent grower, somebody at home with a
small garden, you could just simply,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, education is key, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to educate yourself as much as you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it was huge making that decision
because it's a totally different system
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you screw it up, it can be costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went with raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody were growing in pots and using
bottled nutrients, they could go to
[SPEAKER_01]: something that fits their tent,
which I think a four by four, you got a
[SPEAKER_01]: four by four, a three by three bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the same goes for four by eight or
anything bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: After lots and lots of research,
we decided to use basically the same base
[SPEAKER_01]: mix that everyone else uses, which is 33%
compost, 33% peat or cocoa or your desired
[SPEAKER_01]: media, and then 33% aeration or a third of
each or however you want to say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: At home or commercially, commercially it's
going to be quite a bit more complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a tent at home, someone could either
find a local soil yard that's already
[SPEAKER_01]: mixing something real similar to that and
amend it themselves, or you could go with
[SPEAKER_01]: a great company like Build-A-Soil and buy
something that you know, products that
[SPEAKER_01]: already have integrity and are already
mixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We mixed everything at home and went and
bought peat from Lowe's, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian sphagnum peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like rice hulls and pumice for
aeration, but you can use other types of
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration, volcanic rock and people use
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've actually got some soil that has
perlite in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can source your own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one's tricky, as you probably know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really where you're probably either
going to make it or break it, I would say,
[SPEAKER_01]: is finding good compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that at home or even doing some
composting here at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do a bio-complete compost,
which is what I would suggest for anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really more like your soil food web
and Elaine Ingham School of Thought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amending your soil is going to be a little
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're commercial, I don't suggest
using certain products, kelp meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything really from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ocean is going to be salty and
possibly contaminated with things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plant market that are going to
cause health risks and issues like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some easier ways to dial
things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, since we were commercial,
we tested our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were really doing that under the
guidance of Brandon Russ and doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently, once a month at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got rows and you're using raised
beds, that gets a little bit tricky
[SPEAKER_01]: because each individual bed is going to be
a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing different cultivars,
that's going to change things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different plants pull different things
from the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, there's some great information out
there already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coots Mix and that recipe is already out
there for people to easily access.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can even get a lot of
build-a-soil recipes and what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using just to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prefer soybean meal, alfalfa meal,
and try to avoid things from the ocean,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just because of heavy metals and other
contaminants, but because of sodium and
[SPEAKER_01]: salt build-up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they get that mixed,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they're not going to test their soil,
I would inoculate, plant, and take off
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's going to do pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to do a lot of the work for you
and it's going to get better with time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like using cover crop and other things
like that to help with the full cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: there that's happening in the soil food
web, things breaking down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do use worms, worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get the worms in the bed,
you really don't need the castings a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: lot anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing a lot of that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want me to?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did have a follow-up question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have asked this during the intro,
but on your farm, you said you were in
[SPEAKER_00]: raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size raised beds are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many plants are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have three flower rooms indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a veg and mother and propagation
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have a greenhouse that we just
built.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a lot of that on Instagram at
red dirt raised.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've just gotten that finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, 2022 is going to be where we're
getting to display the spaceship we built
[SPEAKER_01]: out there because it's honestly better
than our indoor operation and more
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable, more regenerative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be using the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also be doing some no-till out there
I think eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've taken and had a lot of people bless
us with advice and information over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years like Brandon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also be doing some ferments and do
ferments indoors, not in high amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really try to let the soil food web do
as much of the work as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Brandon is mainly a water-soluble guy
and a lot of his information and
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations have been with
water-soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really easy way to get balance in
your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: After testing on a commercial level where
you're trying to keep production
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent, that was a big deal for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having that in your toolbox is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get deeper into water-soluble
mineral inputs in a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in beds and you started with your
own soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix versus trying to revive the native
soil in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my question for you before we move on
is, can home growers reuse the soil where
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic nutrients have been used in or
do you think they should just start fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: with making your own soil like you
mentioned with the 33, 32, 33 mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely say start fresh with
that 33, 33, 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not to say it can't be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the way we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would assume that if someone had a
pretty good base mix and had used some
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic nutrients in it a time or two,
they could probably still turn that into a
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil environment over a short
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The microbes will remediate quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll remediate just about anything
quickly or revive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allowing them to do most of the work has
really been key, I think, for especially
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till farmers, but for us as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying less is more kind of attitude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really allowing the plant and the soil to
have that symbiotic relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stay out of their way as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the 33, 33, 33 mix, I just released an
episode recently with Jeremy Silver from
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not sure if he caught that one or not,
but he gets real into detail about 33,
[SPEAKER_00]: 33, 33 and what to use when you're soil
building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't get too deep into that in this
episode, but I do want to know what
[SPEAKER_00]: initial amendments you're putting within
that mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, we'll start with really good
compost, which is going to have more
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in it than just about anything
else you're going to put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Already broken down and ready to go
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also add alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might use a little bit of green sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might use a little soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have some oyster shell meal in our
soil, but not a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use some gypsum, calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little calphos in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm castings, which are going to be a
great source of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we fired it up about three weeks
after actually getting soil embeds with
[SPEAKER_01]: worms, a little bit of cover crop,
and really let everything go for 20,
[SPEAKER_01]: 21 days on its own before planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, those nutrients, majority of
them will deplete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have to re-amend, like a lot of
folks growing indoors, they have that
[SPEAKER_00]: initial amendment, and then they'll do a
top dressing roughly 30 days into the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, folks will do it before
flipping the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will do it 20 to 30 days into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the general way of going about
feeding when we're talking indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you do those initial amendments that
you mentioned, that initial planting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said you wait 20 days and you plant
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point do you do any other
fertilizer added in anymore, top dressing
[SPEAKER_00]: or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think midway through flower is a pretty
good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've tested your soil and you know
the balance and the nutrition levels are
[SPEAKER_01]: there, then you may be able to do a run
with water only.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like malted barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use regular water and only do that a
couple of times a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: In those beds, but occasionally there will
be a feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a little bit extra in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will just top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can, we like to water in as much
food as we can, as much nutrition as we
[SPEAKER_01]: can, as much inoculation as we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water really helps spread things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circling back to the water soluble mineral
inputs, what water soluble mineral inputs
[SPEAKER_00]: do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty big on soybean amino acids,
hydrolysate, soybean hydrolysate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a high quality version of that and
it's pretty water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a form of calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gypsum that is really fine and powdery and
is fairly water soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are familiar with Epsom
salt, magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it and it is extremely water
soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to watch what you buy because
there are chemical versions of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there are mined mineral versions of
these.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suggest down to earth products that you
know have been mined and aren't some
[SPEAKER_01]: byproduct of industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, that is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do use humic acid in powder form.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also use a humic fulvic, a full power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really, I'd say, the majority of
the water solubles that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned a ton there.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you generally apply those water
soluble mineral inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's different times for
different ones, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool thing about those is you can top
dress them and literally get a full run,
[SPEAKER_01]: seven, eight weeks before you really start
seeing levels depleting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can do small feedings with them and
water them in once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soybean amino, the humic acid,
is something that you can use almost all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way through a vegetative stage on end
of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could cut back on the soybean aminos
because of the high nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say probably week five,
week four, a flower, especially if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: running a system like ours where you have
other sources of nitrogen in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: already.
[SPEAKER_01]: The others, calcium sulfate, gypsum,
obviously all plants like calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: some more than others, medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want a strong source of
calcium and magnesium all the way through
[SPEAKER_01]: growth, really, vegetative end flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But potassium sulfate, you're going to use
that quite a bit more in the later stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say in lighter amounts in your
first three, four weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that's going to get a little stronger
in probably weeks four through eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: four through 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some that you mentioned
that people often use as foliar feeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that fast acting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A perfect example would be if you're
starting to see magnesium deficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll do a foliar of Epsom salt,
magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any foliars at all for those
water soluble mineral inputs?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to use the magnesium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to use a bioavailable version of
silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also foliar feed some OHN and a lot of
our IPM is foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: About to get off track there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we can get into that later.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let's see if I'm leaving anything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even microbial foliars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: One made right here in Oklahoma called
Wind River.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great in soil and as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: See if I'm leaving anything out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's really about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few stimulants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple different foliars that we
use that will stimulate the plant's immune
[SPEAKER_01]: system if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's about it for foliars.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you inoculate microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a week at least we're doing some.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a couple of different
inoculations that we like to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are more, well most I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are more fungally dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we do have a couple of different
products even that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've used everything under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish shit, mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: But honestly there's nothing like really
good compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't like to do teas,
indoor especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the risk you may take brewing
bad bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: A top dress of compost especially if
you're using a good mulch layer will go a
[SPEAKER_01]: long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can water that in or you can do a
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically straining the compost
into the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And creating a concentrated version there
and then using that to water in instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm drawing a blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your soil food web folks are probably
bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your land England folks are probably
bigger on these terminologies and know
[SPEAKER_01]: them well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be a little safer version and we
often do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also do teas and we use some
species of fungi as food cycling,
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're a benefit to the plant's
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some are gonna be more for IPM
and to keep pest pressure down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other bacteria, fungi and pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you brought up the risk of
brewing a tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is that you're brewing anaerobic
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's happened to me before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not having enough air stones in the bucket
and then giving it to my plant and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden the plant looks like crap for
several days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually it bounced back but it was a
significant step back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can absolutely happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure you have enough air stones in
there is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people actually put a airline going
directly into their bag of compost that
[SPEAKER_00]: they put into the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you do that as well or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've heard about that tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought that was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't tried that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a brewer that we built with the
help of Layton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with him
from Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do Living Soil Conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Layton helped us build a brewer here
that we've loved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 55 gallon tap coat tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cone bottom and then it's plumbed and has
a really cool air pump going to it that's
[SPEAKER_01]: super quiet and low maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that air entering the bottom
instead of using a stone it eliminates the
[SPEAKER_01]: need to clean a stone or you know buy new
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to replace those things after a
while just from gunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've loved that brewer and we'll use
it even just to mix a feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to aerate our water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily to brew a tea but just to
have good aerated living water and moving
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: That eliminated a lot of the bad issues
with brewing for us and then you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: few different things about brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know our tips that we've been given
are you know strain your compost instead
[SPEAKER_01]: of brew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can often be very helpful and you can
make that concentrated version of that
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculant that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then water that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're seeing any brown around the
ring or the top of your brew and you are
[SPEAKER_01]: brewing a tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that starts sticking to the side
of your bucket or your tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually I believe kind of a bad
sign of that bad bacteria brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That anaerobic bacteria brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe I was told that it was waste of
some sort from you know the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways we tried to limit the times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know when we started out it was
sometimes 24 or 48 hours of brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that eventually got to where it
wasn't really any more than about 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by that time we're watering it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually don't see any of that brown
film.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuck to the side at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that avoids a lot of that
anaerobic activity you know people run
[SPEAKER_01]: into.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do like a 48 hour brew and you got a
stinky smelly you know and that doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: always happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you have enough sugar or
carbohydrates in there for those microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: to feast on and they don't die off and
they probably thrive for you know not real
[SPEAKER_01]: sure how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I typically do no longer than 24
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll pull a little bit earlier
than that just to kind of safe side
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really do teas that often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like you mentioned in the beginning
something you can just top dress compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and water that in right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very effective as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I haven't done
myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hear more and more people talking
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you talk to us about ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you go about doing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in no in no way are we experts in
ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Van from KNF garden I met him at a
convention here in Oklahoma in 2020 I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe and ended up using some of his
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started off with kind of his baseline
in veg which was humic and aminos which is
[SPEAKER_01]: a great combination by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying that's all plants need but
we've seen good results from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ferments that we used were his
versions of KNF and you know I think he's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things a little differently kind of
a hybrid version if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: For him you know he lived in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe and didn't didn't really have a
farm to do KNF on Korean natural farming
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think simplifying it was was
probably what he was going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways you know fermentation taking
fruit and vegetables with sugar and
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing or without I think a lot of
people actually do it without and allow
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff to break down and you know same
process used for making alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all those nutrients become available
again and at some point you can stabilize
[SPEAKER_01]: it with his recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were only going a couple of weeks and
using lots of different kinds of fruits
[SPEAKER_01]: and veggies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know you try to be responsible go
get organically grown fruits and
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetables and start there if you're going
to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the whole premise behind
Korean natural farming is probably using
[SPEAKER_01]: the land you have you know to grow those
fruits and vegetables and then fermenting
[SPEAKER_01]: them and you know using that to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants feeding plants you know and
you're kind of speeding up that process
[SPEAKER_01]: with fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vans idea behind a lot of it is even I
think trying to push certain cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and terpene levels and using certain
fruits and vegetables to target those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started using this bloom ferment and
have now for I would say five six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: With success that's in a living soil
system and raised beds and it's not only
[SPEAKER_01]: using ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're definitely a lot of the times
using less than the suggested amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes if we feel like they really
need something we may give them more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But combining that with that soil food web
I've seen nothing but amazing results
[SPEAKER_01]: from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know I know there's a lot of
controversy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean all in all it's we're still
doing the same thing and we have the same
[SPEAKER_01]: goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us it's always been about quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's almost belief systems
built behind these methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you fear one from another.
[SPEAKER_01]: The community doesn't necessarily always
agree on stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but for us it's always been about
providing the best possible medicine we
[SPEAKER_01]: can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if that's combining some of these
methods together that's that's fine with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have like a general recipe that
somebody can follow or like a source that
[SPEAKER_00]: a new like me can go to and learn how to
start fermenting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go follow at KNF garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know Jeremy has some great ferment
products that I've seen available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another good source.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know don't come to us for that
information necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you you know the recipe that we
use but we're not KNF gurus by any means.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know the man himself Chris Trump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that Chris Trump on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good ferment farmers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good guys still in Cali humble
regions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man I wish I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could name them all off on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that right there ought to get you
started and Vance method is so super
[SPEAKER_01]: simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you can't go wrong there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's even selling his balloon
ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go buy that and just start
there and see you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference but you know he claims
you're going to see a greasier terpier
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and we have seen some great results
from our experience with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I think you can't go wrong with
with his stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay Plant speaker I think is another guy
that may do some hell I think Masonic does
[SPEAKER_01]: some KNF stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know lots of good teachers out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah lots of sources there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with some of those names but
not all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely be following some of
those names for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to get into cover crops a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about making that
transition from synthetic to organic cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crops is something that's optional.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people use it because there
are benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example I use clover for a cover
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Dutch clover is the kind that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I've learned is that it
helps with nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually taking nitrogen from the
air converting it and putting it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in a form that the plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one benefit on one
particular type of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole different types of cover
crops out there with various amounts of
[SPEAKER_00]: various types of benefits for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for cover crops and what's
your process for planting them as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're big on clover as well and native
grasses are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know you just got to be careful what
seed you're starting with because you
[SPEAKER_01]: never know how that was grown or
harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know build the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here in Oklahoma we've got Red Buds Soil
Company and they make some great cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop blends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know we also like planting stuff like
carrots and radishes and things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to penetrate the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And feed everything in the soil or below
the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But process for planting cover crop for
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started with cover crop after initially
filling our beds and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll replant cover crop after harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we've got access to the soil again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really takes care of itself really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're letting nature do its thing and not
too complicated there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between grows when you're planting that
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long are you letting that cover crop
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know are you cutting it down and
letting it die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like a period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know two weeks or a month or what's
your time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll plant and basically let the cover
crop grow until it's maybe becoming
[SPEAKER_01]: annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know getting a little bit out of hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may chop it back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the times we'll let that
naturally occur as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And haven't had to do a ton of
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we don't use near as much cover crop
as a lot of people I've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cantwell over Green Like Productions has
usually got a pretty nice green bed going
[SPEAKER_01]: it looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't use quite that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he uses Dichondra and some other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we haven't tried yet but are very
interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah I would say you know experiment
with stuff like carrots and radishes and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing even you know companion plants
with your medicinal plants or your
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be amazed the difference in a bed
full of plants and a pot with one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see going on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely enjoy one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think so too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a lot of people trying to
make that transition from synthetic to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a step back generally speaking what
advice do you have for those trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: make that transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say be patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know everything may not play out just
like you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially that first run or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if you're doing a no till type of
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: That less is better mindset will go a long
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't water so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that's probably one of the most
common mistakes that people make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going from synthetics to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: A decent sized pot which I've heard Jeremy
and others talk quite a bit about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's going to be enough
moisture and nutrition in that pot to last
[SPEAKER_01]: that plant beyond you know what we
normally would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah you know just be patient and
spend as much time reading and searching
[SPEAKER_01]: for information as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know in an organic system where
things are a little bit more permanent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more research you do up front and the
more prepared you are going into that
[SPEAKER_01]: situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The better your turnout is going to be for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the listeners can find me and my family
ran farm at Red Dirt Raised OK on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our website will be up soon Red Dirt
Raised OK dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come to Oklahoma or if you're in
Oklahoma you can find the dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_01]: shops that we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our Instagram account or website and.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's really.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be the place email would be Red
Dirt Raised LLC dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well definitely have a link to at least
your Instagram down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now YouTube's kind of really like the
medicinal plants being linked down below.
