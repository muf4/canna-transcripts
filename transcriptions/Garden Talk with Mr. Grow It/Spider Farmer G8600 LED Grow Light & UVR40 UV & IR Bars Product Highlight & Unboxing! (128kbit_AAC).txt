[SPEAKER_00]: Spiderformer recently launched a new
series of LED grow lights called the G
[SPEAKER_00]: series which is good for both home growing
and commercial operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They send me the G8600 LED grow light
which is fantastic for a five foot by five
[SPEAKER_00]: foot grow tent which is what you see it in
here but it will also do great in an open
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show a flower coverage area of four
feet by four feet and a veg coverage area
[SPEAKER_00]: of five feet by five feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have other grow lights in this G
series for other size coverage areas such
[SPEAKER_00]: as the G3000 for a three foot by three
foot grow tent, G4500 for a two foot by
[SPEAKER_00]: four foot grow tent, G5000 for a four foot
by four foot grow tent, and the G1000W for
[SPEAKER_00]: a five foot by five foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me my
name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It and today I
[SPEAKER_00]: have another product highlight video for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this series we highlight some of the
best gardening products on the market
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll talk a little bit about the G8600 LED
grow light while I unbox the unit so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can learn more about it and see what comes
in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a discount code for this grow
light code MRGROWIT5 that actually works
[SPEAKER_00]: for all Spider Farmer grow lights and all
of the products on their website linked in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening up the box the first thing here is
a sticker pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They include 10 stickers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is their user manual which includes
specifications for all of the G series
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights, installation instructions,
user tips, warranty information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bars are what comes out next.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are eight bars here for the G 8600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes this grow light does require assembly
although I must say it was actually pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use bridge luxe diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a combination of warm white light
2800 to 3200 Kelvin, pure white light 4800
[SPEAKER_00]: to 5000 Kelvin, and what they call a rich
red light 660 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next out of the box are these plastic
pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: These pieces connect the driver to the
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this bag there are four rope ratchet
hangers and an RJ11 cord which is used to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect and control multiple lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually connect up to 60 G8600
grow lights at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very beneficial for those of you in a
commercial grow operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driver hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the driver with the dimmer box
attached.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has a six and a half foot power
cord attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly are two frame pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow light bars will connect to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I place the two frame pieces onto my
coffee table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to simply clip both ends of the
LED bar to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first bar slowly clicked into place
since I wasn't sure of how much force to
[SPEAKER_00]: use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The remaining bars were much easier to put
in once I realized how much force to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wire in each bar then needs to be
connected to the frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can see I'm doing that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: After all the wires are connected to the
frame we're ready to attach the driver to
[SPEAKER_00]: the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using those plastic pieces that I
showed earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sliding them onto the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: No screws needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those pieces will then click onto the
frame and the driver is now secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the driver is detachable it can be
placed outside of the grow tent instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will result in less heat being
generated inside the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer said this will also help
provide a longer lifespan for the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use only one rope ratchet hanger
on each side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loop it over the grow tent top bar and
then latch each end onto the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dimmer box can be turned on full power
or you can adjust the dimmer anywhere from
[SPEAKER_00]: 10% to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: This unit pulls 860 watts from the wall at
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the PPFD map here shows the light
spread across the coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can of course maximize the light and
increase plant growth if you add CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer also sent me their UVR40
which is their UV and IR bars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with mounting clips, its own
driver and switch so you can independently
[SPEAKER_00]: control the UV and IR, user manual,
the two bars and two pieces that connect
[SPEAKER_00]: the bars to the frame.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were super easy to install.
[SPEAKER_00]: They latch onto the fixture and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They list these benefits and have more
information about both the G-Series LED
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights and the UVIR light bars on
their website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Click the link down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll also place the link in a pinned
comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't forget to use the code MRGROWAT5
for a percentage off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of this grow light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section

video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any suggestions for other
products that I should highlight in future
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, let me know.
