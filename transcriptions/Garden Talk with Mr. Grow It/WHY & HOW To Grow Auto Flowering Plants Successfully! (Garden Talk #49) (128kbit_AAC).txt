[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I myself have never had increased yield
from topping in auto and these days I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really trying to focus more on feeding the
soil rather than feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this stuff is just kind of
subjective as to again what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your goals are, what your grow area
looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for concentrates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are actually growing them
because of the fact that they grow so
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to turn them around and press
them and create concentrates right from
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a really small area and
you've got a ceiling max height then you
[SPEAKER_00]: might consider smaller pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely, in my opinion,
want to transplant them well before the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that's alive has a will to
survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even microbial life,
everything wants to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned in to the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 49.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode interview, Turek Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for five years and
specializes in growing auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks about growing
autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from starting soil,
feedings, environment conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: when to harvest, and more.

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Chad, but some of
you know him as Taret Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excited to have you on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally have you on my podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had you on my live show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on your podcast, so now we get you
here on my Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be talking all about autos
today, so becoming more and more popular
[SPEAKER_01]: autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just about every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody hits me up and has a question
about autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a whole podcast based around
them, so I thought you'd be a great person
[SPEAKER_01]: to have on and talk about autos,
your experience with them, and so on and
[SPEAKER_01]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get into so much stuff in
regards to autos today.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, one of the things I like to do with
every guest would be an introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I just want to say thank you for
having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really honored and I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got really passionate about gardening
probably about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, I'd been around my
grandparents who garden a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegetable gardens, a lot of irises and
just different plants and trees around
[SPEAKER_00]: their property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up a little around that and that's
my exposure to it, but I wasn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: interested until about five years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's when I realized how much certain
medicinal plants could help my Tourette
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: My online name often is Tourette Grower
and that's because I have Tourette
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: My 14-year-old son also has it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a genetic thing that runs in
families.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started when I was a young lad,
probably nine or ten, and would just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of do weird stuff with my eyes and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't until my early 20s that I was
actually kind of diagnosed with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other things that come along with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anxiety, OCD are very popular things that
go along with Tourette syndrome.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I discovered how well medicinal
plants could help me and of course along
[SPEAKER_00]: the way, just other things about different
plants that we like, I began using those
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and quickly realized that it's
pretty expensive to sort those plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: other areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, well, I'm just going to start
growing my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a little bit of garden experience
just being around my grandparents and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody handed me a handful of auto
seeds, someone local to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just began popping those and germinating
them and learning and growing and
[SPEAKER_00]: researching.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, it's one of the co-morbids of
Tourette.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tourette's is OCD, so I can become pretty
obsessive, compulsive about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think gardening was one of them,
but more in a positive way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started searching around,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love podcasts, including yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was searching around for podcasts
revolved more around autos and more around
[SPEAKER_00]: the home grower and not necessarily
commercial grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't one, so man, I just decided
to start my own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was back, I think, in 2019 or 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how that came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, for the last five years,
I've just really been plugging away,
[SPEAKER_00]: just learning and gardening and just being
a part of the community that exists and
[SPEAKER_00]: just jumping in there and letting that
iron sharpen iron, as they say,
[SPEAKER_00]: growers coming together like you and I are
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just talking and taking truth nuggets and
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm located in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was born and raised here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Married.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got five kids and busy life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to your
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below and also your podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link that down in the description
section below as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did an awesome episode on harvesting,
drying, curing, and people just thought it
[SPEAKER_01]: was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have that episode linked
down in the description section below as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday, as a matter of fact,
I got a message about that episode and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much they learned and how much to help
them now that you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with your style of gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you primarily grow autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you only grow autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you an indoor grower, outdoor grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you grow in soil, cocoa, hydro,
organic, synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your grow style when growing autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do primarily grow autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have my first photo period seeds that
have sprouted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a few days old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be going down that route and
experiencing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also primarily grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two two foot by four feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Four foot grow tents by six foot high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, I've got an auto pot system
set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just an automatic gravity fed
watering system that feeds the plants from
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in the other tent, I just hand water
in pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only had two tents for just under a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have a certain system going
with the tents or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, one's just hand water and one's
automatically watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them, I typically grow my own
personal herbs in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one, I chuck pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say I breed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chuck pollen and produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is kind of set apart for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one is set apart for my own
medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as far as soil, I grow in,
I guess we call it soil, but it's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: grow medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call it soil, but it's peat moss based
typical potting soil with perlite and a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of compost added in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do prefer to grow organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went organic a couple of years ago,
about three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of dabbled a little bit in the
synthetics as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself really being drawn to the
organics and really nerding out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil food web and microbes and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really treading down a path right now
of getting deeper and deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as right now, I just grow in an
amended potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I just got dry amendments by
Down to Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just mixed them up and did a super soil
type grow, like a subcool type method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previously, I was using Nature's Living
Soil Concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those worked well for me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to be testing out FOOP sent
me a little beginner line of their entire
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've heard of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an organic bottled nutrient
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called FOOP, F-O-O-P.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically made from fish poo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got the bloom and a veg and a
sweetener and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just sent it to me, so I'm just going
to be testing that out and seeing how that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: As time goes by, that passion and that
style of growing is growing for me itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep getting more and more into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I'm getting into some natural
farming practices and trying to learn some
[SPEAKER_00]: different things with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made my own lactic acid bacteria
serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did my first indigenous microorganism
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just made my own water soluble calcium
by roasting egg shells and soaking them in
[SPEAKER_00]: vinegar for a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I resource my food waste and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally going down the organic rabbit hole
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dive into autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should start with the pros and
cons to autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have a whole video on this on
your channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually showed them my YouTube
recommended feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it blew up because YouTube has
been recommending it everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still recommend it even though I've
watched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of pros to autos and
there's a lot of cons to autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about some of the pros
and cons to growing autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the pros to start off,
they grow really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that attracts a
lot of people to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the time that they sprout from the
soil, oftentimes within 70-75 days on
[SPEAKER_00]: average, they're finished from the day
they sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them even earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will be done within 55-60
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really fast ones and still get fairly
large as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them will go 90 days but for the
most part, they're just super fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You pop them in the soil and once they
germinate, they just take off like a
[SPEAKER_00]: freight train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within 60-90 days, you're harvesting your
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely one of the pros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another pro is that it's a day-neutral
plant which means it doesn't require a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific light cycle to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter if you are under 18
hours of light or 12 or even 24 with no
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll flower regardless based off of
genetics and not based off of a light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas traditional photo period plants of
any species, they require a certain amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of light and darkness to trigger that
flowering in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a pro and it's a pro to a lot of
people because if you've got some room,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you've got a veg tent and let's say
you've got a corner, a space, or a spot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can just throw an auto in there and
let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing tomatoes and peppers and
whatever else you're growing and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of areas and you want to throw an
auto in there, why not fill up the space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like that are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for concentrates as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are actually growing them
because of the fact that they grow so
[SPEAKER_00]: fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to turn them around and press
them and create concentrates right from
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a super fast turnaround They provide
a lot of oil and resin and stuff that your
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional photo period plants will
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, depending on genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, they're just as
powerful as long as you get good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just grow really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that's great about them is
if you keep them all under the same light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle and you've got one area with one
light cycle, you can just do a constant
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual grow of different ages.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually will take less light and
that's not something I'm really familiar
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's something that maybe is
better chatted with with Dr. Bruce.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the DLI and stuff with autos,
I'm not sure what that looks like but I do
[SPEAKER_00]: know in general, I think they're going to
require a little less intense light
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's on for say 18 hours instead
of 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your DLI is going to change with that for
those light nerds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about as far as I can go with it
unfortunately because I don't know much
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the pros of growing
autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cons to them absolutely for sure
like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest one being that they
automatically flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be the biggest con.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of these things are
subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on who the grower is and what
they're looking for and what their style
[SPEAKER_00]: is and what their goals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that it automatically flowers
can be a problem especially for a new
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you encounter any deficiencies,
let's say you're in a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it's been two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're like in a potting soil of
some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like a Fox Farm happy frog.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty popular potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people to start out in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That potting soil in particular is it can
tend to be more on the inert side I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: you can say.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot of compost or worm
castings or humic acid and like all that
[SPEAKER_00]: different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a whole lot of it in happy
frog as compared to ocean forests say with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Fox Farm brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you sprout in something like that
within a few weeks, the plant's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: run out of food.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be showing deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not purposeful and proactive
about feeding that plant or making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're set up for that next stage and
you show deficiencies, you don't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of time to correct those because
the plant's going to end up going into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course once you see the
deficiencies, what's happening in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: has already happened and you're now just
seeing it in the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that could be a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're learning to grow and you're
running it or even if you're an
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced grower and you run into
deficiencies, it's going to be an issue
[SPEAKER_00]: for you because you don't have that time
to slow down and fix it and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'm going to wait another week
before I flip into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to wait another two or I'm going
to train it out a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that could be one of the
biggest cons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest cons to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the second largest con would be
that you can't clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you find a cultivar that you're
in love with or that you really liked or
[SPEAKER_00]: that helped you in some way, you can't
just clone that and keep it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let me be literal here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can clone it and it'll root,
but it's not going to do anything for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best that I've ever seen done was a
friend of mine in San Diego and she cloned
[SPEAKER_00]: it twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: She cloned her original and then cloned
that one again and just had kind of this
[SPEAKER_00]: consecutive harvest, but each clone was
smaller and smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you can imagine, that's a waste of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in my opinion, unless you're like
really in love with that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't clone them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another con right now at least is there's
a lot of bad genetics running around when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to autos in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of Facebook backyard, you know,
Paul and Chuck or bro breeder genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, some of them are okay,
you know, and not everybody is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to, you know, speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to paint a wide brush for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my biggest caution would be to stay
away from these Facebook groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, because a lot of these Facebook
groups, you got guys on there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, selling their you know,
there's there's Paul and Chuck seeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 bucks for five of them, you know,
and they, you know, only two of them
[SPEAKER_00]: sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them's a female and that one is
just wanky and doesn't get anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just got to be have discernment
like with anything and just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a con.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of crazy genetics running
around right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think another con and I kind of
touched on this already, but is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: may not be the best to learn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they may not be the best plant
to learn on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the reasons that I spoke about a
bit automatically flowering because with a
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period, which ironically,
I've never grown until now, but with a
[SPEAKER_00]: photo period, you know, you have that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those are probably the biggest
bullet points as far as pros and cons go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think you touched upon a lot of
good ones, both pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that you
mentioned is if there's any sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: stunting growth while the plant is in the
vegetation stage, you could potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: impact yield, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to negatively impact yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a stunting growth,
it's going to automatically flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be the best for new growers
to start with auto flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have much more control with photo
periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that's that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like because of that, because that
stun growth in the vegetation stage could
[SPEAKER_01]: negatively impact yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are planting auto flower
seeds in the final container.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're avoiding that transplant process,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So my question for you is what pot size do
you grow autos in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you starting in a small container and
then transplanting your way up to a larger
[SPEAKER_01]: container or are you just starting out in
a large container and avoiding that
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant process altogether?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do both, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just simply because I just get
itches up my butt and I like to experience
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And experiment, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I just I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, I start in the final
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can transplant autos, but you do have
to be careful and you do have to do them
[SPEAKER_00]: at the right time to avoid that stunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you definitely, in my opinion,
want to transplant them well before the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also want to transplant them before
they get too root bound in their
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, if you start in a solo
cup, typically, and I get this from my
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, Dan, full duplex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, when those leaves hit the outer
edge of that solo cup, the roots of that
[SPEAKER_00]: auto is most likely hit the bottom and
just starting to kind of circle around
[SPEAKER_00]: down there for some odd reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is totally anecdotal with just me
and a few people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just all kind of agree that for some
reason, when they're started in a really
[SPEAKER_00]: small pot, if you don't transplant them
quick enough, they will become root bound
[SPEAKER_00]: and it seems to trigger them in the flower
a little bit earlier almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like anything less than one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm not claiming that scientifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not claiming that as bro science
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just kind of some of us have been
like, hmm, that's interesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to get it out of that solo cup
if that's what you're starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once the leaves kind of hit that outer
edge, I use that rule of thumb for any
[SPEAKER_00]: size container I start in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll start like in a half gallon
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started in half gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was kind of doing a miniature fino hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the leaves hit the edges,
the plants had showed sex.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went ahead and just transplanted
the ones that I wanted to keep and move
[SPEAKER_00]: those ones forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't transplant them in time,
they're just going to end up getting root
[SPEAKER_00]: bound and they're going to end up going
into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you transplant them,
you're just going to really stunt them
[SPEAKER_00]: even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So transplanting is possible and it's very
doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, you really got to pay attention
and kind of do it at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to keep going and it's
on a time schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clock is just ticking and ticking and
ticking and ticking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to mess that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are going to claim that
transplanting is beneficial because then
[SPEAKER_01]: they have the opportunity to sprinkle some
mycorrhizal fungi onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to attach to the root system,
be an extension of the root system,
[SPEAKER_01]: help with nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So transplanting process, they're able to
sprinkle directly onto the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally like to do like a third cup
of worm castings, put that in the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to definitely help with
beneficial microbes, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's close to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've had good luck doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size container?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in five gallons?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in seven gallons or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: All over the place, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my auto pots, they're 3.9 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm considering upgrading to the 6.6
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is because they end
up running out of food and top dressing is
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging and stuff with those because
they're bottom fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically 3.9 gallons for the auto
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my other tent, if I'm doing like any
type of pollen chucking or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I usually grow in small pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's I can sprout a bunch of them and
kind of weed out the ones I don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, then I actually like to put
two 10 gallon pots in a two by four tent
[SPEAKER_00]: and just grow two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just two of them in that two by four tent
is great too because in a 10 gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I can mix up a super soil and
it'll have plenty in there to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: thing through those whole life with a more
true water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll fill up a two by four tent
easily, two plants in a 10 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of all over the place,
man, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've tried a whole bunch of things
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I'm always just doing different
stuff, you know, but as far as like pot
[SPEAKER_00]: size at what I would suggest, I mean,
in my opinion, a lot of this stuff is just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of subjective as to, again,
what you're doing, what your goals are,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What your soil area looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a really small area and
you've got a ceiling max height,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you might consider smaller pots,
you know, just things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to back up and go back to your
starting mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touch base on it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned that you're mostly in
peat mixture with perlite using down to
[SPEAKER_01]: earth nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you be a little bit more specific on
like, you know, what's your ratio of peat
[SPEAKER_01]: to aeration?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what specific amendments you're mixing
in to begin with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually, um, right now I'm
actually using bagged potting soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This last run, I actually used ocean
forest cause I had three or four bags
[SPEAKER_00]: laying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on getting away from that,
um, just to save some money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, from what I understand,
that's a typical, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: three, three, three of, um, you know,
like peat moss compost and then an
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration like perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get away from perlite
because when I hand water, it all just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tends to float to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm thinking of going with rice holes,
uh, because of their, their, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration quality as well as, you know,
that they break down and provide silica to
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's been some talk about
something, um, I don't know, man,
[SPEAKER_00]: like something, I forget what it is,
but there's been some talk about how they
[SPEAKER_00]: can produce some type of negative chemical
or something, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the potting soil is already bagged up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I did this round now,
what I usually do is I've been using
[SPEAKER_00]: nature's living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's just a concentrate that they
provide to you, which is basically like a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of dry amendments already,
uh, kind of cooked up, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the microbial life and it's readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also has microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's typically what I would use before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I would just add that to a happy
frog or an ocean forest, um, or pro mix or
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those, those potting soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: You add that to like the bottom third or
mix it thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's supposed to be like a pretty much
a water only all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what I'm doing now is I've switched
gears and I bought all of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, dry amendments, uh, to make my own
super soil from down to earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, this is my first time doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I can't really speak as to how it's
working or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've just got some seedlings that just
sprouted up that are in their final pots
[SPEAKER_00]: in that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I did, uh, was I just mixed that
into the bottom half and then the top
[SPEAKER_00]: half, I just did ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the idea is, and some people say ocean
forest is too hot for autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I have never had one auto have an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I mean to each their own,
uh, but that's just been my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I start seedlings in that stuff
with no issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the top half of my pot, I have got
Fox farm ocean forest, and I did add
[SPEAKER_00]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to add, you know, quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to have really, really,
really well draining aerated soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, the bottom half is,
uh, ocean forest with the, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: dry amendments mixed up inside of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so basically, you know, my seed will
just pop out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop up and it will grow in that ocean
forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's in the plant is mature
enough and it's a little, a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: established, it'll hit that super soil and
it'll begin to use that, um, to uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: those nutrients that the microbes have
been breaking down for the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's kind of where I'm at right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sure if I'm just going to keep
going down that route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm considering, uh, getting into
purchasing like a two foot by four foot
[SPEAKER_00]: bed and getting some peat moss and some
rice holes and some of my own compost and
[SPEAKER_00]: make, start, starting my own living soil,
uh, indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, I've got a lot to learn when
it comes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I don't want to just pull the
trigger on that without doing my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my research first, you know, cause I don't
want to waste my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's an investment, you know,
mess things up, then you mess things up
[SPEAKER_01]: and then your overall result might not be
what you anticipate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive a little bit deeper into
nutrients, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about your starting mix when
you're not doing the super soil methods
[SPEAKER_01]: that you talked about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just using bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually the nutrients are going to
deplete in the medium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is going to highly depend on the
pot size, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a larger pot size with more
soil, more nutrients in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to take longer for that plant
to work through it versus a smaller pot
[SPEAKER_01]: size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say a three gallon grow pot,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say you're in a smaller grow pot and
you need to feed the plant, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to feed the plant the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you're organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What nutrients, I think you mentioned down
earth, what nutrients are you using and
[SPEAKER_01]: when are you feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So typically I did mix, um, so prior to my
dry amendment grow that I'm doing now,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, I'd mixed nature's living
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that would have enough nutrients
to get me through usually until,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, mid flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then mid flower is, is when I
would start to see deficiencies that are
[SPEAKER_00]: run into issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so with, with autos, a lot of
times you can get through your veg without
[SPEAKER_00]: adding any veg nutrients if you really
don't want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on what type of soil you're
in, a lot of people like will grow an
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean forest, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when their auto flower goes into
bloom, um, they will then just begin
[SPEAKER_00]: adding their bloom nutrients or top
dressing, you know, bloom, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: type dry amendments and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but what I would do is, um,
I would let the plant grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, uh, what I like to do now is
right when it starts to go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, what I mean by that is,
you know, when, when the flowering spots
[SPEAKER_00]: are starting to, you know, really spit out
some of those, um, white pistols and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, I like to top dress,
um, and begin feeding teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'll do is when it starts to go
into flower, um, nature's living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: makes this product called girl flower
power and it's made for bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's, of course it's something
that we can make on our own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you just sprinkle that on top and
maybe etch it in a little bit and water
[SPEAKER_00]: over it and, uh, let that, you know,
kind of get in there and that'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll begin to break down and feed the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I also like to brew teas,
um, whether that's just an earthworm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings tea to add microbial life itself
and some nutrients, um, or nutrient teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where your, your plant is actually being
fed an organic tea where it can uptake
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a benefit of the girl flower
power is that, um, it contains microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: and diverse microbial life, but it also
has, um, readily available nutrients for
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants because it's already basically
those dry amendments have already been
[SPEAKER_00]: cooked, so to speak, have already been
broken down and readily available forms
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so between the top dressing and a T,
um, you know, the top dressing,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to sprinkle a little bit on and
kind of water it in and then let it,
[SPEAKER_00]: let it go for maybe another week and then
sprinkle a little more and just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bits at a time and then just feed teas and
let the tea go to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, that'll usually get me through,
um, you know, till the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a lot, not a lot, really,
not a lot of feeding going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and these days I'm really trying to
focus more on feeding the soil rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding the plant, um, with my own kind of
grow technique and what I'm into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and you know, it's, it's, I tend to
focus more on the quality, the end quality
[SPEAKER_00]: and the, of course, everybody wants
volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, I, I prefer my, my,
my, my red delicious apples to be huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I, if, if I can, you know, I want to
enjoy it, you know, but I, I'm more
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about the quality of that apple
as well, or the quality of the herbs as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try not to just push for size,
um, in looks and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to really dial it in because I'm
using this stuff as medicine, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, more so than, than recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I try to, um, you know,
just focus on the end quality and as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as, um, you know, terpenes and different
things like that, um, that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: help me medically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing organic works great for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I'm not trying to grow monster
plants or trying to push anything too
[SPEAKER_00]: hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not my, uh, just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I totally get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, uh, let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about environment for autos,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what temperature and humidity do you
typically aim for when growing autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same as photos, typically.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really anywhere, if I can keep it
anywhere, really, if I can keep it around
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 through the whole growth, that would be
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do try to tailor it a little more
earlier in its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to get the humidity up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some seedlings and I've got the
humidity up to about 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when they begin to grow, and get a
little bit bigger, um, I'll drop that down
[SPEAKER_00]: personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try, I try to mess with the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's difficult for me because I live in a
pretty arid, dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the humidity can change very fast as
far as declining for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I, I, I'm constantly battling to
keep it up, to keep it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can just keep it at around 50,
basically through the whole grow and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: drop it a little bit during flower,
which is really easy for me, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, but you know, to be honest,
man, um, I've grown them, uh, outdoors
[SPEAKER_00]: during, like right now, during the winter,
it's January.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had plants out there, um,
a couple of years ago right now in
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, it'll be 60 during the day
and drop down to 32, 30 to 29 sometimes at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if I don't have too many of those
nights of that freezing temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown some, some pretty good looking
large plants out outdoors in the winter in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's not too humid here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to worry about any type of
rot or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's, you know, it's,
and it's sunny, it's sunny Southern
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but you know, I do try to,
to dial it in man, as much as I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in my indoor environment,
of course, to, to just get that extra
[SPEAKER_01]: little umph, you know, a lot of people
don't know that these plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: resilient, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an optimal range for conditions,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a tolerance range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a large range that these plants
were able to survive in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cold nights are common outdoors and the
plant still survives, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's within their tolerance range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that tolerance range is,
is wider than a lot of people think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And temperatures, you know, pretty much
the same as photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I do like to run warm if I can,
uh, I prefer to hit like 80, maybe even up
[SPEAKER_00]: to 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think that's a little warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but in my environment, I noticed that
that kind of tends to have the best,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, fastest growth for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and when you're using led lights,
I think there's might, there may be some
[SPEAKER_00]: science to that of, of being able to run
things warmer or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure, but, um, yeah, you know,
environment, um, the more that I can dial
[SPEAKER_00]: in my environment, uh, the better my
plants and more healthier my plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be and going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do try to dial it in, but you're
right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these, you know, plants,
they want to live, you know, they just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've got a mandarin orange tree that,
uh, I was gone for eight months,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, caring for my grandma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came home, um, it was almost
dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had only been coming home like on the
weekends sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I ended up just chopping that
thing about four inches from the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be darn man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came out there in the spring and that
thing had little green leaves on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that thing is about six and a half
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, it just, those little sucker leaves
grew and I braided them and it was really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these plants want, they want to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like you and I, they want to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every, everything that's alive has a,
a will to survive, you know, even
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial life, everything wants to live.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so it, it's, it's, um,
they'll do well, man, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll do well in, in environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown them like in the, in the rain
and just all, it's not ideal, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, I've done it, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people that are okay
with the, you know, just being in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tolerance range, but there are some people
that want to really dial things in and be
[SPEAKER_01]: in the optimal ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 is something that's often supplemented
when growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you supplement CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I'm, I don't because I just,
I'm not educated on it and I'm not sure as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as like, you know, an exhale bag or a
TNB Naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not educated on that really as far
as, um, how that works and being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: add more light and, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not convinced necessarily that,
that those products really do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, if someone can explain it to me,
I'd, uh, it'd be great, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, I just, I don't supplement,
uh, CO2 just cause I'm not, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: convinced that it, that it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can cut that out if you've got like
any, type of deals with anybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like TNB Naturals or somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, uh, I'm just not, I just don't,
uh, I don't supplement CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used the TNB Naturals canisters I
used for quite some time and I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: did put a CO2 monitor in the room and it
actually does work.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was oftentimes where it average on
around 800, 900 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course it's going to depend on how
much you exhaust.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was exhausting intermittently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, now I started using the mushroom
bags and so I use the exhale bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: the mushroom bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have it hanging above the plants,
the top part of my grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within a couple of weeks, that whole
substrate was really inoculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the whole thing's like white at
this point and I don't have my CO2 monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one of the holder ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to actually hook it up to the wall
and it's like this big, basically the size
[SPEAKER_01]: of softball for those that are,
that are listening in on one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There really needs to be more companies
releasing CO2 monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm, I'm about to talk to AC
infinity and be like, dude, you guys
[SPEAKER_01]: release a CO2 monitor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fly off the shelves cause nobody has
CO2 monitors right now that are
[SPEAKER_01]: affordable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know pulse has one, but I think
theirs is connected to like a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a $500 device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it also has like PAR and it has
temperature, humidity, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worth the money, you know, cause you can
actually measure PAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a lot of people, they say it's
worth the money, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really love to see a standalone CO2
monitor that hooks up to your app.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the different levels
throughout the day along with temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, soon, I mean, if you're a company
listening, build, you know, make it right
[SPEAKER_01]: now, because that'll, that'll for sure fly
off the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confident of that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would help everybody out,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I by no means I'm saying that
they don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just personally was, was, I haven't been
convinced, but I mean, you've got a CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor and you're, you're monitoring it
and it's up, but, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got some, some friends who have done
the same thing and it, and it shoots up to
[SPEAKER_00]: eight or 900, but, but within 24 to 48
hours, it's, it's back down low and it
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't hike back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, even when they're shaking the bottles
or, and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I just personally, I just haven't
pulled the trigger on it, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: A monitor would be great, you know,
an, an affordable one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people like me can be like,
well, let's try this out for myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about plant training?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a highly debated topic, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about some of the types of
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So low stress training, I think a lot of
people do with autos in particular
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely helps with kind of having those
even colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You prevent that, you know, the plant
growing Christmas tree style and have one
[SPEAKER_01]: big main cold that's at risk for,
for bud rot mold to get in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: it due to lack of air flow, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So low stress training is very,
very common.
[SPEAKER_01]: Topping is one of those things that are
very, very debated, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We touched upon how, you know,
any stunting growth is going to negatively
[SPEAKER_01]: impact yield, but there's some people that
swear by topping and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing one top at a certain point and they
swear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they get a bigger yield off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your stance on training?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can even get into supercropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do any low stress training,
supercropping, topping, any type of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: training when you're growing autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've never supercropped, but I used to
top every single auto I grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my stance really is
whatever works for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my stance.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's usually my stance on a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that top topping has a place for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this stuff is subjective for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping is, is good when it's needed as
far as ceiling height maxes and stuff like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out in a two by two by four
tent, a four foot ceiling height,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, unless you're growing like
micro greens is really low.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants would grow up into
dangerous areas in that light very easily
[SPEAKER_00]: when you you've got a pot down at the
bottom that's taken up a foot and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil level starts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to stay, let's say
you're light in particular, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay at least 18 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That only leaves you so much space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I topped.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can indeed top autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can top them at whatever node you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, is it going to be
beneficial for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's break this down into a couple
of different categories here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as yield, I myself have never had
increased yield from topping an auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I can't say that with absolute
certainty because like we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, I'm unable to clone an auto and
do a side by side comparison.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if we could clone one and then
have two identical plants, top one,
[SPEAKER_00]: not top the other, grow them the same and
see what happens, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have the benefit of doing
that with autos because you can't clone
[SPEAKER_00]: them correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my opinion, and based off of my
experience, I don't see them giving me any
[SPEAKER_00]: more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be grower error.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be my own grow techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be something I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not pumping full of synthetic
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're in DWC, there's so many
variables that could play into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, yes, you can top.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're topping to get more yield,
that didn't work for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If some people say that it does work for
them, then maybe that method of those
[SPEAKER_00]: people that it's working for is kind of
where people need to flock to and build
[SPEAKER_00]: upon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, in my method, it doesn't really
produce any more yields for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there are other reasons to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for me, ceiling height,
another reason to do it, there's a guy on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram named green 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: He tops and hacks and bends and ties and
trains these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're just yarn, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he does it because he wants to shoot
for all colas and not necessarily popcorn
[SPEAKER_00]: fluff and stuff all along the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure it gives you more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people, I know it
doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer to just grow them naturally and
do some low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think low stress training is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really stress the plan out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biggest yields that I've gotten if
I had to compare and I had to make a guess
[SPEAKER_00]: was from low stress training.
[SPEAKER_00]: A topped plant, an un-topped plant,
and then a low stress trained plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The LST one, I've gotten the biggest
results out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually just simply kind of
bending the plant over almost and letting
[SPEAKER_00]: it grow horizontal and letting the side
branches grow up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just ended up with these huge like
just spear colas shooting out all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times these days,
I just let them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just because I'm fascinated with
their natural state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like to, you know, shave the legs,
so to speak, and lollipop a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: get some of that larf on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, I just like to let
them grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a debated topic, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you top?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's like I said, that depends
solely upon your experience, your goals,
[SPEAKER_00]: your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just my subjective opinion on it
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about defoliation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to strip their plants
basically naked to where they have just a
[SPEAKER_01]: few leaves on each branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any type of defoliation
techniques on autos?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not unless they're really leafy and bushy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not unless a leaf is really in the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of tucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to tuck the leaves and get them out
of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a really, really leafy plant and
it just looks really wild and nuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: then yeah, I'll defoliate it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try not to do too much at one time,
but I like to just kind of give the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: what it needs to the best of my ability to
get the best genetic expression out of
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of my goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few more things that I want to
get your input on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you flush before harvest or give your
plants a period of darkness before
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then along with that, when do you
harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm growing with synthetic nutrients,
then I do flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't really grow synthetically
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I don't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing an organic, sometimes the plant
will naturally fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as when I harvest, I mostly pay
attention to trichome development as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as I look for the pistols.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like we talked about on my
podcast, I look for the pistols to recede,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of curl up and kind of want to go
into the plant, turn orange or brown or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever color they turn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I like to see the flowers
themselves kind of fatten up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pay attention to trichome
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really weird thing with autos in my
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear other people say this as well,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't go to amber trichomes a whole
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're waiting to get like a 50-50,
you know, like you do, like some people
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go crazy, like 50-50 amber cloudy
on a photo period, like autos,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of times they won't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll just be waiting around and that
thing's done and ready to be harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I typically just wait until I see
growth slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they'll, I think you said,
like sometimes they'll even stop kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: uptaking a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as usual, I wait for those pistols
and I just wait for the trichomes to be
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly cloudy and nice and, you know,
milky and cloudy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wait for some amber, usually I'll
get five to 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point I tend to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much my preferred area of
harvest, probably even with a photo as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this could have easily been a two or
three hour podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that we didn't
cover maybe in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be a part two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely appreciate you,
you coming on and tell us how can the
[SPEAKER_01]: listeners find you and what do you have
upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can find me, uh, my hub basically
is Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of where I hang out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you can find me there at Tourette
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also auto flower podcast, those two
accounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, same two usernames on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you can find me there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and this year I'm just diving more
into organics, uh, more into natural
[SPEAKER_00]: farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be documenting, uh,
how to produce your own seeds at home,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, just to have your own plants to grow,
not, not teaching how to breed or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be, uh, just trying to share
and document how to grow for, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: inexpensive, um, real cheap and use
resources from around home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, and that's pretty much it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, uh, looking forward to
continuing to, uh, be a part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: community and, uh, I appreciate you having
me on brother.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no problem.
