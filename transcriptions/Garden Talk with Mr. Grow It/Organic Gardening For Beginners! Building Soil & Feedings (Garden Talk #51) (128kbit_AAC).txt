[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit of peat moss is it's very
acidic and to that acidity we can load it
[SPEAKER_01]: with calcium that's alkaline and that
brings us to the pH that we desire and
[SPEAKER_01]: that also creates a situation where the
plant has access to a lot of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're intelligent and build an
infrastructure and assets that allow you
[SPEAKER_01]: to manage your farm without buying it
again every year, you can start to create
[SPEAKER_01]: profit margin for yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do not want to put it lightly that if
you're making soil and you're counting on
[SPEAKER_01]: it, the local compost could be the thing
that bites you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found is that doubling your
container size usually increased your
[SPEAKER_01]: yield by about 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: For living soil it was better to use
pumice and rice holes and that became one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the standards for the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you don't stop what you're doing,
add one new thing and make some soil from
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch, get your own hands in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll never go back if you try
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka MrGrowit and you're tuned in to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Garden Talk podcast this episode
number 51.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Jeremy Silva.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the owner of Build a Soil and he has
a very deep knowledge when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about building a good soil,
the foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also gets into the feedings of organic
inputs that happen throughout the plant's
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great information for those of you who are
just getting started in organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast or Patreon if you'd like to
[SPEAKER_00]: support, you can do so by going to patreon
.com slash MrGrowit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero costs for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thanks to Happy Hydro for sponsoring
this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Hydro now has complete grow tank
kits and many of the kits actually come
[SPEAKER_00]: with my beginner grow book.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kits consist of AC infinity grow
tents, an AC infinity ventilation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: your choice of lighting, whether it be
Spider Farmer, HLG, The Green Sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: Company, or Grow His Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So home living soil, nutrients,
oscillating fans, and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to Happy Hydro grow
tank kits down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below and you can use coupon code MRGROWIT
for a discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC infinity for sponsoring this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over their grow tent,
which has a canvas density of 2000 D,
[SPEAKER_00]: making them the thickest grow tent on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has an aluminum plate that mounts your
controller to the grow tent with the
[SPEAKER_00]: lightproof pass through for cable routing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The frame has 50% thicker steel poles and
carries two times more weight than the
[SPEAKER_00]: standard grow tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coupon code MRGROWIT will get you a
discount on their products and I'll leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link to their website down in the
description below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for watching and I'll see you next
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, how cool is that full circle?
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that respect, it was just a
no brainer for me to come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't feel like you were going to be
some weird show that I hadn't heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: that was not going to be good for business
or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also saw a big opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked to a lot of people that maybe
haven't heard from us yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I look at as a big opportunity to
maybe share more of the message,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one area where you're clearly
known for is organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really want this episode to be,
I thought it'd be most appropriate to have
[SPEAKER_00]: it getting into organic gardening,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So more specifically, I like to cover the
foundation, building soil, and I also want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get into the organic feedings
throughout the plant's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into all that,
things I like to do with every guest is
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, name is Jeremy Silva and I started to
build the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost 10 years ago, it feels like more
than 10 years, but it's kind of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: where's the day where it became official.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I came into gardening maybe
differently than a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm finding it's more of a normal
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in a cul-de-sac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up where this was not normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, when I finally saw it,
like my grandma had a vegetable garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was young, so I didn't, didn't mean that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I moved to Colorado in 2009,
um, it became something that I was
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinated by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that you could just take a
potato.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dig a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, arguably you don't even need to
dig a hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I've learned about no-till
gardening, Ruth Stout, she would just put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the mulch, but you could put one
potato in, come back months later and have
[SPEAKER_01]: a dozen potatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like nature's 3D printing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was also at that time, um,
wanting to be more positive, wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: create, uh, a lack of maybe more stability
by knowing, Hey, at least I can grow my
[SPEAKER_01]: own food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was also growing medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it seemed like all of that came
together as sort of a gateway to turn me
[SPEAKER_01]: into somebody who cared about gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never thought that I'd be like,
yeah, gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's been huge in my life and it's
taught me a ton besides, uh, just about
[SPEAKER_01]: the result, but there's a lot that's
affected me as far as the process and the
[SPEAKER_01]: discipline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, um, over a decade
ago, I was in a place where I was looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for where my life was headed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a lot of changes that happened when
I moved to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was working somewhere that I wasn't
really excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my American dream was to have some
small internet business that would allow
[SPEAKER_01]: me the freedom to garden more and go disc
golf and snowboard and kind of live the
[SPEAKER_01]: life that I've dreamed about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had no family at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it wasn't a huge risk, but it was
still really scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went into my job on a Saturday with
almost no reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd thought about it and I quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured if I didn't do it,
I was too comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to wake up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: 40 years from now and I'd be doing the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, it was hard, but I made the
decision and everything worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like a propane dank that was hard to
buy one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few things that happened in between that
as part of the story.
[SPEAKER_01]: But eventually, um, I placed a few ads on
Craigslist and people started buying worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was always answering questions
on the forums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden it turned a corner
where we had more orders than I could deal
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to start hiring employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it went from this little idea that
might pay for a couple of bills to a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity that consumed a lot of my
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to decide, is this really what I
want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been the best decision I've ever
made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build A Soil now has about 40 employees
and we have a vegetable farm and we
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute to multiple countries,
as well as all over the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And none of it would have been possible
had I not just made that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: five second decision to walk in and quit
and say, this is what I'd rather do with
[SPEAKER_01]: my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, um, that's pretty much the story
in a nutshell, if that helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a customer of Build A Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did a whole bunch of stuff,
like a good haul during Black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have a crazy Black Friday sale
every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually did a haul and then actually
did an unboxing video to show my audience
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what I got from you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people seem to really like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you were blasting out content on
Instagram for a long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally made the switch to YouTube and
things have blown up for you on YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you got your, it's just so much
good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a 10 by 10 with all different
quad, you know, several different
[SPEAKER_00]: quadrants in there, different things going
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing your audience how to grow
organically, you know, use your products
[SPEAKER_00]: and do things in a sustainable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us just a little bit about
your YouTube channel, kind of what you got
[SPEAKER_00]: going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you that don't know,
we have a 10 by 10 grow tent and that came
[SPEAKER_01]: serendipitously.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had it at my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer had space for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided, well, there's, we're moving
our shipping area out of our retail store
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're moving that into its own
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had the space in the tent and I
decided to throw it up and then it was
[SPEAKER_01]: really nice to come into work and have
this oasis that I think most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for when they set up a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to walk into a jungle and have
it be a little bit of peace in their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were already documenting four by
four grow tents and the idea of sharing it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a walk-in space became an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started doing different
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some customers that had raised
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had some customers that wanted to do
sub-irrigation or five gallon containers
[SPEAKER_01]: or small containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't always recommend it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the YouTube channel became a way for us
to prove it, walk the walk, show people
[SPEAKER_01]: that these things actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, when I was learning,
that's all I paid attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of information, a lot of
people that want to teach gardening that
[SPEAKER_01]: have never done it, but have watched some
videos and they kind of teach what they
[SPEAKER_01]: feel should work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that leads to a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was unique, I think, to have a
producer that didn't sell just other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's stuff and actually showed you how
to use it in a method where we could fail
[SPEAKER_01]: just live in front of everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually you see these grows start and then
they just don't update.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, ah, it didn't go that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that obviously put a ton of
responsibility on us to perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I should feel like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're gardening for your family
back in the day and you didn't produce,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't always go perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 10 by 10 has basically been just a
display of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested, check out the 10
by 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, as you mentioned, a different style
in each quadrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're about to start the next 10 by 10
series in the next month.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a little bit of groundwork to
lay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Jeremy's
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're on one of the podcast
platforms listening to this, just search
[SPEAKER_00]: build a soil on YouTube and his channel
will pop up and you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do a lot more this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the vegetable farm where we've
threatened to document it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so much work we don't usually
take the time to, but this year we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be documenting a lot of what we
do on our vegetable farm because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of little tips and tricks and we want
to share it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So looking forward to that this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get advice from you because I just
started vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm going to say just started,
but like three years ago, you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a little, little something going on,
you know, leafy grains and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to watch your content there and
get tips from you on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for doing the vegetable content,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're often recommending Coots Mix,
you know, you give credit to him,
[SPEAKER_00]: give credit where credit is due.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does the one to one to one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 33.33%, 33%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just say 33, 33, 33 moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first 33 is the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sphagnum peat moss, coca coir,
pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about what those things
are, pros and cons to them and which one
[SPEAKER_00]: you generally recommend to use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've noticed there's a lot of confusion
with new gardeners about volumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get kind of strange, like weird,
almost like they're overthinking recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the 33, 33, 33% the easiest way I think
to describe it is it's a three part recipe
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: One part of each ingredient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens to be 33%.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to add another part,
you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people add some biochar or something
and they'll call it a percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, where all these
formulas came from were based on what was
[SPEAKER_01]: available in size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you're using peat moss,
we'd usually go to the local supplier,
[SPEAKER_01]: Home Depot or something, garden store,
that have either a three cubic foot or
[SPEAKER_01]: more commonly the 3.8 cubic foot of peat
moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's in a big bale and it's
compressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to fluff it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the 3.8 was fluffed, we found out by
just manually doing it by bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us found there's about six cubic
feet of material in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we started the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one bale of Canadian sphagnum peat
moss, 3.8 cubic feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be considered six cubic feet of
peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that, if that's one part, we would then
add one part of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six cubic feet of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people use worm castings and compost,
but the base recipe is just at least it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be one part compost, one part peat,
and one part aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aeration, most people were familiar with
perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the white little pebbles and all of
the Miracle Grows soil on the Fox Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the forums, what the guys were
doing that were making soil from scratch
[SPEAKER_01]: is they were trying to make a conscious
decision to be unique, choose a better
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredient if they could and make it a
more sustainable ingredient if possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people started questioning the use
of perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found out that we can go deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could talk all day on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But essentially, instead of using that for
living soil, it was better to use pumice
[SPEAKER_01]: and rice holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that became one of the standards for
the base.
[SPEAKER_01]: So building your own recipe from scratch,
one part peat moss, one part compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: one part aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people use black lava rock,
red lava rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pros and cons to all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be happy to go into a little bit
of detail there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you built the base, now the idea
was how do we amend it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we add minerals and nutrients that
are going to feed the soil and in
[SPEAKER_01]: consequence, feed the plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we get it in some sort of
balance?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before I took any soil testing
classes, before I read any books,
[SPEAKER_01]: and before I understood, I would just
blindly follow recipes I found online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how we found the Coots recipe was a
desire from the grow forums to document
[SPEAKER_01]: side by sides, which is still kind of what
Build A Soil does.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just document what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I ran a recipe from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was in the forum at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran the true living organic style.
[SPEAKER_01]: We ran the sub cool style recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then something was telling us to try
this Coots recipe because he was just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was so simple, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He only added kelp, neem, crustacean,
and a mixture of rock dust and calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other recipe from the forum was like
30 ingredients, you know, guanos and blood
[SPEAKER_01]: meals, just everything in the kitchen
sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made the recipe and to honor it,
I actually went up in the forest and got
[SPEAKER_01]: some forest litter to make it really
alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the best experiences
I've ever had growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time that every single
plant that I planted was all uniformly
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't like one was rented and
stunted with leaves that were,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, curling and twisted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, I think that connection
really brought us to want to share that
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe with everybody and everybody who
uses it swears by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think all of us eventually move on
once we understand to tinkering with what
[SPEAKER_01]: we want out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's what anybody should do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a recipe for the best meal ever,
do exactly what the chef says,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then tinker it to your preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Coots mix has been a really good
way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed that you mentioned sphagnum
peat moss, but you didn't really touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa or pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something like against it on a
sustainable side of things that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prevents you from, from going
towards cocoa or pit moss for that base?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pure quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every decision we made at Build A Soil
was to have the best quality regardless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we're getting bigger as far as
scale, we have multiple desires.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is to have a very sustainable recipe
that is more environmentally friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll discuss the pros and cons of that
because we're a little hypocritical kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of mixing soil, bagging it, shipping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sustainability is very important,
but our goal when we started the recycle
[SPEAKER_01]: logo, as far as Build A Soil, that's
because we all recycled soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily that we were recycling our
ingredient to be the most sustainable in
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, but we all also cared about
probably even more than the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: footprint, the treatment ethically of the
animals and not giving our money to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Monsanto subsidiaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the desire to like not use bone
meal or not use a particular ingredient
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes came from who it was funding
and what those animals were fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if a cow is fed, round up,
sprayed crops, and then their waste is
[SPEAKER_01]: deemed approved for organic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We said, we don't want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not good enough for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when it came to peat moss,
we trusted Qt because he said that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: best quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we did soil testing, eventually
we found that when we made the same recipe
[SPEAKER_01]: with Cocoa Core, it did not hold as much
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its cation exchange capacity, its ability
to magnetically hold the nutrients was
[SPEAKER_01]: lesser than.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a big benefit when it comes to
hydro because now you can flush it out
[SPEAKER_01]: fairly easily and you can load it back up
with what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in soil, that was one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, arguably it's not terribly different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could still make a great soil with
Cocoa Core, but Cocoa Core is mined from
[SPEAKER_01]: islands and other places far from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is one of those crops that now can
be grown non-organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those chemically grown coconuts can be
harvested and sold as organic Cocoa Core
[SPEAKER_01]: because any waste from a farming industry
is deemed approved for organic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're questioning where you're
getting the Cocoa Core from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the location you get it
from, it could be near the ocean and it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be very salty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in organics, they don't buffer it with
the chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the Cocoa Core that you buy is
already buffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's buffered with Chilean nitrate or it's
loaded with different minerals to offset
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the challenges that cocoa has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so an organic soil company,
they can't just go buy the precharged
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa because it has chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you have to use raw cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And raw cocoa is a little bit more neutral
on the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while pH isn't mentioned a lot when we
talk about organic growing, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the soil is normally the
derivative of the pH, not the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talking about it every day is not as
important right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't change it like you can change
the hydro water that dramatically changes
[SPEAKER_01]: the uptake of your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Cocoa Core is a little more neutral.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit of peat moss is it's very
acidic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to that acidity, we can load it with
calcium that's alkaline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that brings us to the pH that we
desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that also creates a situation where
the plant has access to a lot of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's now in the target pH where if
we're starting neutral already,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a little bit less choices as far
as how many minerals we can load.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was part of the concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally for me, because I loved peat
moss, made these recipes, the way we run
[SPEAKER_01]: build a soil is to teach what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for us to offer a cocoa mix was
disingenuine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're only getting to the point
where we've had a lot of customers request
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have data on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're considering releasing a cocoa
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have some wood fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the past, they were very alkaline and
they were more of like a money saver.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple of products in the
market that are very acidic made from wood
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're very sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they grow very young trees and
they harvest them into a wood pulp that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more like peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those rob nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can only use a percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the most straightforward for the home
gardener is to use peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what happens is occasionally
they'll go in a gardening farm and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: tell them peat moss is ruining the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then they go, oh, I don't want to
do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather use cocoa core or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the burden of knowledge is that
cocoa is freighted in using fossil fuel on
[SPEAKER_01]: big tankers that are locked up because of
trade war issues and coming from other
[SPEAKER_01]: countries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you get it and maybe salty,
maybe not, maybe it's not as
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where peat moss overseas across the pond,
they burn it for energy and they have very
[SPEAKER_01]: small amounts of peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using it is not sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where here in the United States,
we get it from Canada and the Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat Moss Association has a very tight
lock to the point where I can only get so
[SPEAKER_01]: much allocation of peat because they only
mine so much and it restricts what we can
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last year we made about 10,000 cubic yards
of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're slated to go to over 20,000
cubic yards of soil this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peat moss is going to be a real issue for
us as far as availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as hurting the earth,
that availability is capped because the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian government won't let them mine it
in a non-sustainable fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so obviously it's not the greatest to
go dig up portions of our earth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the peat moss is arguably less of an
environmental impact than the cocoa core,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on how you look at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And either way, none of them are
sustainable as making your own on-farm
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so weight loss, ways to do that that
Coot talked about back in the day would be
[SPEAKER_01]: to make your own leaf mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: You rake the leaves in your yard,
you put them in a black trash bag and let
[SPEAKER_01]: them sit there for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they turn into black leaf mold
compost, which would be a good suitable
[SPEAKER_01]: replacement for peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other alternative would be
to, we've considered this a build a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're still looking into the numbers,
but setting up a worm farm that only
[SPEAKER_01]: recycles cardboard and paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way you have kind of a lesser
nutrition worm casting that could act like
[SPEAKER_01]: a peat moss, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: But peat moss is ancient and it has a lot
of benefits and it has biology and it
[SPEAKER_01]: makes a very, very good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that sharing this data with you,
at least we'll let you know, no matter how
[SPEAKER_01]: you make potting soil, kind of a hypocrite
as far as sustainability.
[SPEAKER_01]: The better answer is we keep our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't throw in the trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you make this, it could be a
lifetime that you're keeping this soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should ease in the burden a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old way was just to literally throw
the soil away every single time and get
[SPEAKER_01]: new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole idea was, well, we don't
want to make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just throw it away, buy new soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as long as the profit was there,
it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're all wanting to make sure that
we're more sustainable, but also the
[SPEAKER_01]: profit margin is pretty tough in farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can't just all afford to throw
everything away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to be intelligent.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ways that organic farming can
win is that it has ways, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligent and build an infrastructure
and assets that allow you to manage your
[SPEAKER_01]: farm without buying it again every year,
you can start to create profit margin for
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: While improving the land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use peat moss and there's also pit
moss, which you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just found that it doesn't produce as
quality of a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the idea of using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lightweight for like hanging flower
baskets.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's huge benefits to using it,
but it's essentially looks like it looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like you took shredded newspaper or
shredded paper from your literally from
[SPEAKER_01]: your paper shredder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, it's off-putting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's ink on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see, and I'm sure it's soy based
ink.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not bad for potting soil,
but it doesn't scream the highest top
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It screams recycled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're wanting to work more with pit
moss, but the blends that we've made
[SPEAKER_01]: robbed so much nitrogen that now we need
to offset that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not quite as sustainable in that
regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the future is that build a soil is
going to be putting a lot of research into
[SPEAKER_01]: the wood pulp, the cocoa core and the pit
moss to find recipes that we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: different percentages of these,
not to be so dependent on peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hope that answers your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your first 33 to base next 33,
you mentioned a compost or some people use
[SPEAKER_00]: worm castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several different types of
compost, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you generally recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there any that should be avoided?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a difficult question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what's kept organics out of
the mainstream for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I mean by that is if you're in
California and you're on the grow forum
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're talking to a guy in Florida,
you can tell him use this nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: use our O water pH it and use this cocoa
core or this rock wall or this bucket of
[SPEAKER_01]: deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can produce ideally basically
exactly the same as what you're producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have an intelligent
conversation back and forth about the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environment might be slightly
different, but you can game that right ACs
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidifiers and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we literally created the duplicated
to grow environment in organics as best as
[SPEAKER_01]: we could do is say, we'll find some local
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the guy in California, the guy in
Florida are having night and day different
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations and they're trying to help
each other out and have no idea how to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So compost quality is of paramount
importance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what kept a lot of people away
from making their own soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would go find some compost on
Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd make a potting soil fall in the
Coops recipe and all their plants would
[SPEAKER_01]: die.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few things to consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, you can find local compost and a
great way to test it is put a plant into
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix it down in your soil recipe at
a 33% recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go a little lower and you could
put three or four containers, one with 10
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, one with 30%, one with 20% and
just see how they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Within a week, you're going to know a lot
more than had you not done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, a lot of times if you find a big
compost yard, they should have a lab test
[SPEAKER_01]: on it and they can share it with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've found is most of these yards do
not know what their own compost test
[SPEAKER_01]: means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they share it with you and they
just hope you don't either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then everybody goes, well,
it's tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they buy it and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go, I don't know, I bought it,
it was tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, test it for what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically like the local compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, there is so much compost
around me, I would love to use it all
[SPEAKER_01]: because then I wouldn't be paying freight
on better compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you get it tested at the lab,
it has potassium that is maybe 10 times
[SPEAKER_01]: the phosphorus level and sodium that
matches it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's alkaline and it's full of stuff
that we're trying to keep out of our soil
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use any more than five or 10%,
like the 33% we're suggesting,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll just fry your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what unfortunately a lot of
municipal compost is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're fortunate enough where you
have a gardening club locally or you have
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are active like Michigan,
California, there's a lot of states that
[SPEAKER_01]: do have some premium inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have to go by word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like who's got the best compost that
everybody knows about as the goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then from there you can probably trust it
a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how gardening's always been
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trust the recommendations you're
given.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find the guy who's got the good
plants, the good nursery, the good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What Build A Soil did to build a business
is used testing and data to take some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that guessing out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have to trust, we can verify.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I would recommend you learn a
little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always do a test on your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're commercial and you're looking to
buy compost, I would test it before I buy
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just a home gardener,
you can read the test that they have and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe understand it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could do a whole episode just on
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things you can do is
typically worm castings is a safer bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm casting will reduce the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is if it's locally
made compost from people just dumping
[SPEAKER_01]: green waste and the compost it,
it could have some residual herbicides in
[SPEAKER_01]: it and the compost may be too young.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have dewormer from manures where
once the worms have worked it,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if that was originally in there,
it's usually ripped to shreds and the
[SPEAKER_01]: biology and enzymes make it safer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the magic of the worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find a lot of people use worm
castings in their recipes because it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to be less wild as far as quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here's the other weird thing that
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to a large scale worm casting
producer, they typically make a casting
[SPEAKER_01]: that is not, it's not very rich in
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so quickly made, which means that
it's unlikely to cause a problem in your
[SPEAKER_01]: soil recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worm castings often is the default.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time, people would just guess
and do 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for their one part, 33.33% of compost,
they would go half compost, half worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings and they'd make their recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'm going to leave you with is that if
you're going to get compost and you've
[SPEAKER_01]: never heard of the brand before,
like we recommend Malibu and Olde
[SPEAKER_01]: Mountain, not because they're the best in
the world, but because they've been proven
[SPEAKER_01]: to be standardized so that you can make a
recipe at known percentages and it will
[SPEAKER_01]: duplicate what we're experiencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works really, really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't have access to that,
when I was on the forums historically,
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast of Maine was a great brand on the
East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Malibu and Olde Mountain was good on the
West coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you couldn't find those,
what you would do is just reach out online
[SPEAKER_01]: and go through what I mentioned,
just growing a plant in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if you put a tomato plant,
straight compost, then it grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dilute it percentages and it does
well, maybe you found something great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess what I'm trying to say is you
don't always need a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to paint this picture that
you have to be a scientist to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: organically, but I do not want to put it
lightly that if you're making soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're counting on it, the local compost
could be the thing that bites you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last 33 is aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are several options for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already talked about some perlite,
rice holes, lava rock, pumice,
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us, get a little bit of
more details in regards to some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things, kind of, you know, their benefits,
if anything should be avoided or be aware
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally what we did on the forums is we
would look for something more natural than
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason was we found that perlite was
obsidian, which is not an unlimited
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a black beetle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful rock and they mine it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what they do is they run it
through a factory with a lot of energy and
[SPEAKER_01]: that puffs it like popcorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it expands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you see is the white,
very lightweight material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you understand that most of the
products we buy on the shelves are
[SPEAKER_01]: basically, we're paying for the freight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you go to a grocery store,
most of the costs of that didn't go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer and went in the freight,
getting it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we try and put as much on one
truck as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So freight ends up being the biggest
portion of what we pay as far as a hidden
[SPEAKER_01]: tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to soil, it is a loss
leader at a lot of hydro stores and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy and it's hard to get it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to buy a whole pallet at a time
to justify the freight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perlite is like a game changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they started adding perlite,
not only is it really fluffy for the cells
[SPEAKER_01]: starting thousands of seeds in these
commercial greenhouses and lightweight to
[SPEAKER_01]: send all the starts to Home Depot for
everybody's garden, but it's also a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bag of soil is pretty light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can sell two, three cubic foot in one
bag, throw it over your shoulder because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's peat moss and it's perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the idea in living soil was we
wanted to keep the soil forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why when we started using larger
volumes, but we also looked at the
[SPEAKER_01]: aeration and when you keep soil around
forever, the perlite starts to break down
[SPEAKER_01]: right away into powder and it starts to
float up to the top of your recipe when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't lend itself to keeping
without impaction over a long period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were wishing to get away from that
for a number of reasons, not sustainable,
[SPEAKER_01]: not really a real mineral, like it was
puffed up even though arguably it holds a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of air, like it has some huge benefits
to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what started to come out in the forums
was lava rock is very porous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a microbial condo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's made from the minerals and where's
good food made in the world?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hawaii, Pacific Northwest, anywhere where
volcanic activity created really
[SPEAKER_01]: abundantly mineral rich soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought, oh, we're using lava rock
and we started buying lava rock and the
[SPEAKER_01]: red one is more iron rich and the black
one might be more rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not positive, but potentially
manganese, but at least less iron and so
[SPEAKER_01]: we were playing with recipes there and it
makes a pretty good soil, but I will tell
[SPEAKER_01]: you the lava rock, it's heavy and it's not
quite as good at being an aeration
[SPEAKER_01]: amendment more than just a drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't hold as much oxygen in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it works and it works well,
but the learning curve from building a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, like if you were to just go to a
healthy organic farm, dig out their black
[SPEAKER_01]: rich soil and put it in a pot and try and
grow and now in a container, that
[SPEAKER_01]: container, the biggest challenge,
even though it might test well,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the physical characteristics will make
it almost impossible to keep the air and
[SPEAKER_01]: the water in there enough to make the
plant grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just going to be over water right
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to get stagnant in areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why potting soil is mimicking the
native soil, but to be in a container,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put some lava rock in a bucket of
water and it would sink.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did some research on the porosity and
pumice, it floats in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's closer to what pearlite does.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's real in the sense that it's just
mined from the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: People use it in other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a lot of data, like they use
it in the beauty industry for foot lotions
[SPEAKER_01]: and scrubs and all sorts of stuff to help
with skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, there's lots of
testing done on it to make sure it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really logical to go that
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, people build water filters with like
biochar and pumice and all sorts of weird
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pumice became a go-to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's lighter weight, which means it didn't
ruin the freight and it held air and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: good for the microbial condo, which we
need the bacteria to live in all those
[SPEAKER_01]: little space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has so much surface area, a lot can
happen there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there we thought,
well, rice hulls, they use because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: lightweight and it replaces pearlite
because it adds drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why is it's made of silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all the growers on the forums were
like, man, we're all buying silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be great if we could just put some
rice hulls in there and add silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kept us from using a hundred
percent rice hulls was the fact we wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep soil forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're thinking, well, if I know till
this soil and the rice hulls are eaten by
[SPEAKER_01]: the worms over the first year or two and
they're gone, where's my aeration?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the goal was, okay, of the 33%
aeration, let's use like 10 or 15% of that
[SPEAKER_01]: as rice hulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worst case, we still have a lot of
pumice in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Best case, we get some fluff out of the
rice hulls and we get some long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people started saying, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do whatever I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pumice, rice hulls, I'll use a hundred
percent of one, 50-50, didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I used it as one third of my
recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I will tell you, you can use less
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our best recipes are closer to 20%
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to balance out much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can add minerals and
amendments more pointedly to your recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the old Cooke's recipe at 33%,
that's cause he made his own vermicompost
[SPEAKER_01]: with his own amendments in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was done at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us, when we're unsure of the
quality of compost, we're adding more to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes all you have to do is reduce
the percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit and add maybe a little more
aeration and a little more peat moss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can make a spicier compost work
very, very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's easy about organics is if you
didn't overdo it, you can always come back
[SPEAKER_01]: later and brew a tea or top dress and give
it more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of like an athlete can only eat so
much protein at one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can only front load our soil with so
much nutrients at once before we upset the
[SPEAKER_01]: balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, if this is sustainable,
we're going to have to come in and
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligently add more as we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that became the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things for aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biochar holds about 10 times its weight in
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, I try not to
categorize it as aeration because if
[SPEAKER_01]: someone used 33% of that instead of one of
the others, it could cause a catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very carbon rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things you can learn about
organics is that carbon is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feeds the biology that then breaks down
and makes the nutrients available to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But too much carbon can rob nitrogen and
that can upset the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's this carbon to nitrogen
ratio that makes good compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just front loading your soil with too
much biochar can be a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So good rule of thumb, if you're not
familiar with the biochar is to use maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: maximum 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely times you can use more,
but without knowing for sure, I would just
[SPEAKER_01]: say it's all one third, make my base and
you can add an extra percentage of biochar
[SPEAKER_01]: to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I more consider the aeration to be
pumice, perlite and rice holes or lava
[SPEAKER_01]: rock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the four main.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, some people use pea gravel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people literally take hydrogen,
the clay balls from their old hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and they go, well, I don't want to
waste them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put that as an aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of works as a drainage,
as taking up space in your recipe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the hydrogen clay is so smooth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no porosity there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in our experience, it just doesn't
work very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So take that for what it's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about vermiculite?
[SPEAKER_01]: Vermiculite is something that we don't use
here, but it is of benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the reasons why is I just want
my crew breathing it and dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like eliminated perlite and vermiculite is
fantastic for the crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air quality is already bad enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our goals for 2022 is to improve
the air quality in our soil mixing
[SPEAKER_01]: building that we just built.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so keeping some of those ingredients
out is always a benefit, but vermiculite
[SPEAKER_01]: has a very high CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very lightweight and people use it to
hold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it becomes more like biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, let's say you're a
producer and you're going to have 100,000
[SPEAKER_01]: little seedlings that you're starting and
you're going to sell them to Home Depot
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing something that needs to
be dry, you would want to do their peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss perlite recipe because you could
water every day and it would just dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're wanting something to hold some
moisture for a little while so you can
[SPEAKER_01]: lower the irrigation and the plants you're
growing don't mind being a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: moist or they prefer it, you're going to
get the recipe with a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: vermiculite in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a soil building perspective,
it has textural qualities as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: holding more moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the one reason why I would consider
adding it to a recipe right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: the way build a soil does it is it has a
very high CEC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the difference in potting soil is
that potting soil, while it has cation
[SPEAKER_01]: exchange, it's not really used.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: In soil, the cation exchange is based off
of clay, minerals that have broken down in
[SPEAKER_01]: the organic matter for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's very, very real to base your whole
farm off of that math.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a potting soil, that math is more of
like a gut check.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we haven't ventured to the vermiculite,
but if we wanted more nutrient holding
[SPEAKER_01]: capability, biochar, vermiculite,
things like that can potentially hold more
[SPEAKER_01]: in your recipe, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you have your 33,
33, 33 mix, organic amendments should be
[SPEAKER_00]: added as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microbes will work to break down those
organic amendments, turn them into
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that the plant will not take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the build a soil craft
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: The past several grows and my plants love
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the options for initial
amendments that could be added to the 33,
[SPEAKER_00]: 33, 33 mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go over what Coots recommends and
it'll also give you some rules of thumb to
[SPEAKER_01]: go by so that you're not blindly following
a recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of this is based on Steve Solomon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Steve Solomon, the intelligent gardener
has got a great book.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in Tasmania.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to him right at the onset of
COVID and he's just been a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: he's been inspirational to me and been
willing to take my phone calls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm always asking him questions
about some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he had this three-way lime mix that he
used and it was like dolomite lime,
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural lime and gypsum or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Coot referenced the three-way lime
mix, but he always wanted to add a glacial
[SPEAKER_01]: rock dust and eventually it changed that
to be basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's because it's a volcanic rock
dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Coot's recipe was, hey, if soil is made
of rock dust ground up in organic matter,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what he wanted to duplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the rule of thumb for the Coot's recipe
across the board was a half a cup of each
[SPEAKER_01]: one of your nutrients you're adding per
cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A cubic foot came to be known as about
seven and a half gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look online, its mathematic formula
is anywhere from 6.8 to 7.5 depending on,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I mean by that is you can fill a
perfect 12 inch by 12 inch by 12 inch box.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it exactly one cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fill it perfectly with peat moss
and call it one cubic foot, but then you
[SPEAKER_01]: can just press it down with your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now is that really a cubic foot or is
there room for more?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use seven and a half gallons for a
cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you add a half cubic foot of each
one of your amendments, you should be
[SPEAKER_01]: safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maximum that we like to see is up to three
cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Coot's recipe is only one and a half
cups of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always add more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think less is more and that's the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then on the mineral side, you could add up
to about a cup or two of your favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: mineral.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally no more than four to six cups of
minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four cups of minerals per cubic foot is
the Coot's recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of it, two of those is rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people would mix some glacial and
some basalt or you just use all basalt.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two was a mixture of your
calcium's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one mineral for plant growth is
calcium, calcium, calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he would usually add oyster shell flour
and that was the calcium side or an ag
[SPEAKER_01]: lime or a mixture of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we started doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would mix in two cups of basalt,
one cup of some oyster shell flour and one
[SPEAKER_01]: cup of some gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And funny story, when I first started
this, I didn't know there was a difference
[SPEAKER_01]: between rock dust and he was encouraging
me to buy local.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I messaged Coot and I said,
all I could find was calcium sulfate and
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't even sell it at the local farm
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they told me it's gonna be like 50
cents a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were 50 pound bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was blown away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought a whole bunch of them,
brought them home and I used that four
[SPEAKER_01]: cups of gypsum solely as my rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of the better recipes I'd
ever made.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I learned that overdoing
calcium, especially gypsum was not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to round it out, we wanted the Coot's
recipe specifically, one and a half cups
[SPEAKER_01]: of amendments, four cups of minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm telling you is like,
if you have alfalfa meal, you could add a
[SPEAKER_01]: half cup of that to this recipe and it
would be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But his recipe is one half cup kelp meal,
one half cup crustacean meal and one half
[SPEAKER_01]: cup neem or caranja, better yet a mixture
of the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you learn about it, a neem or
caranja, that's a seed from a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soy is another seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton is another seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why we don't use soy or cotton
is they're the most GMO pesticide sprayed
[SPEAKER_01]: products there are in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're totally approved for
organic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could be growing and roundup
without even knowing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the reasons why we avoid
some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the caranja is a nitrogen fixing tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very clean on heavy metals and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So adding that in as your seed meal,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kelp meals for all the micronutrients,
the entire periodic table comes from the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean and the kelp has hormones because it
grows it grows feet in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of the fastest growing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kelp, big reason, all the trace
minerals, all the magic from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem or caranja, a seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the protein is going to come
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like if you're vegan or a
vegetarian, you need the protein from the
[SPEAKER_01]: nuts and the seeds and all that,
not just from the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's none in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the last one was crustacean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crustacean means a mixture of like
shrimp or crab.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why Coote recommended that was
very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was calcium, carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was loaded in calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had some protein from the leftover meat
that might've been in the crustacean,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Had some phosphorus, but really it had
this advantage also that the shells are
[SPEAKER_01]: made out of chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't know, chitin is the
second most abundant substance on the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: First is cellulose, next is chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chitin, I used to call chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: C-H-I-T-I-N.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be chitiny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to joke until we learned it was
chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't as funny then.
[SPEAKER_01]: But chitin is something that plants have
come to use, potentially activating their
[SPEAKER_01]: systemic acquired response, their S-A-R,
their defense system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of like when we talk about having an
immune system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why is insects are also
made of chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess it would make sense that if
chitin's around, maybe that means insects
[SPEAKER_01]: are around and there's some sort of
defense response there, but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we knew that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his recipe was simple, but arguably not
simple in his choice for why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to keep it basic, half cup of
crustacean meal, half cup of kelp meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: half cup of neem cake or neem seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing, just words.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one and a half cups of total
amendments per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just doubled that
thinking, ah, if that's good, twice as
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we learned since is that kelp,
less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has arsenic in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has lots of trace minerals in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better to keep that one at a lower
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could double the others if you'd like,
if you know you have a really nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: hungry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other things that a lot of
people did is they would add their
[SPEAKER_01]: favorite extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would copy the Coutts recipe and then
say, you know what, I'm going to add a
[SPEAKER_01]: half cup alfalfa and I'm going to add
maybe a half cup of fish bone meal or
[SPEAKER_01]: guano or whatever their favorite thing was
that they couldn't not use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that way, the Coutts recipe is
really the infinity base recipe that
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody uses and then soups up according
to their own needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to go to really small
containers, you might up the nutrients a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit in top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going in huge containers,
you might just keep it standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a local compost, you might
lower the percentage, but it was such a
[SPEAKER_01]: working model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's what took off like wildfire
out there for people to just trust that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can make a soil from scratch that
would actually work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you're making something from
a recipe online, like for food,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically you want at least one review
saying, Hey, this didn't taste awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try the recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody had success in the Coutts
recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to ask, like I mentioned,
I use build a soil craft blend,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I swear, and you probably know this 24
to 48 hours after watering it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like this putrid smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the smell is just, I thought somebody
was dead in the room or something at one
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that horrible smell?
[SPEAKER_01]: So after top dress, cause I don't get any
odor out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know the odor in it if it gets wet
or if I brew it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically what I do though is I wiggle
it into my mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's covered in worm castings and
mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the odor just typically can't be a
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it is, is there's crustacean
meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you ever smelled some old crab,
I mean, get pretty gnar when it's breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And biology that's of decay is what's
going to make those nutrients available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also fish meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fish bone meal in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's camelina meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a weird one because it's a wild
flax and it's kind of like mustard in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that it smells unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got like this, the oil that's in
it, cause they don't de-oil it first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like, like linseed oil or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it has like a turpentini,
like it has a weird odor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can blind, you combine the
protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rich in protein that wants to kick
off that fermentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got neem in there, what smells like
garlic, mushroom, gnar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem cake is gnarly if you're not used to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells gross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you combine that with like the ocean
stuff and then you get it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did not build this to be a
potpourri of good smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: We built it solely with the intent of
making a diverse fix-it mix, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I add to my soil without having
to guess every time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the craft one actually came from a
buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: His last name is Kraft.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't call it Kraft because it was
crafted.
[SPEAKER_01]: His last name is Kraft and he grew a lot
of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, bro, can you just mix all
that shit together so I don't have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it and be a good seller?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of our best selling products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did do is I took his idea and
instead of just blindly mixing it
[SPEAKER_01]: together, I measured the NPK of all of
them, put them equal by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did some testing to make sure P
was above K and it actually made some
[SPEAKER_01]: sense from a soil testing background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's our favorite product.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it on the vegetable farm because,
I mean, for us to get two bags of fish
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, two bags of kelp, it's just,
there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the mice can get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have to unroll the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bringing a tote of Kraftland to the
farm, it's just all in one scoop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we can tell anybody that works on
the farm, if you're doing a bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: grab one big scoop, 18 pounds,
and amend the bed with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's a longer season crop,
we can say do double.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then all of a sudden, growers were
telling us even before we knew it was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be popular that it was their
favorite product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're researching amendments,
we mentioned a half cup of each,
[SPEAKER_01]: no more than three cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Kraftland gets confusing because
there's minerals in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd recommend most people have kind of
followed our recipe that's on the bag
[SPEAKER_01]: there, what to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can go a little above.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you take three cups of nutrients
and the four cups of minerals per cubic
[SPEAKER_01]: foot, that's about seven combined cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say be less than that with the
Kraftland because it's not as high a
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of minerals as if you made the
Kutz mix from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, we use Kraftland as
our supplementary, meaning we'll make soil
[SPEAKER_01]: according to the recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Kraftland will now from now on be
the amendment to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've already front loaded with so
much minerals, the minerals don't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like the basalt's not going to
disappear in the first cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the Kraftland becomes a great
addition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where Kraftland came from,
if you look up Steve Solomon, he would
[SPEAKER_01]: teach you how to make an organic
fertilizer mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would recommend that you added
something with phosphorus, something that
[SPEAKER_01]: had the seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would also add something that had
like the kelp or alfalfa, like that had
[SPEAKER_01]: the trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was a way to construct a
complete recipe if you weren't just buying
[SPEAKER_01]: something off the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where Kraftland came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the immediate reaction growers get is
because it also has some calcium and some
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium in it, which you all know if
you're in hydro, it's like CalMag will fix
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so immediately when they watered in or
top dress, before the biology even has a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to break some stuff down,
they're getting some mineral release right
[SPEAKER_01]: away, which is very helpful oftentimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Kraftland is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes it really, really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned what you could do
for initial amendments, but you could just
[SPEAKER_00]: do the Kraftland, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to keep it simple,
just.
[SPEAKER_01]: You absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I used to go to the gardening store
and try and buy like a pre blended
[SPEAKER_01]: organic, you know, there's a lot of
companies that have individuals like you
[SPEAKER_01]: could go buy alfalfa or you could go buy
fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it got to the blends,
I didn't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's why.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the local gardening store or
the hardware store and you grab an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: blended fertilizer, all purpose or tomato
fertilizer or rose fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll even put pictures of roses on
there as if the rose has a particular diet
[SPEAKER_01]: that it prefers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I don't want people to be misled
that a tomato needs a specific fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants, annual flowering plants,
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They require the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's nothing special about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we all feel our chosen plant
that we prefer to grow is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: special to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people love tomatoes and it's the
only plant that matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just because of that doesn't mean we
need a special fertilizer for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then you'd flip the box over and
you'd start reading it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what they did to get it
organic listed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to use ingredients that are
approved for organic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to be organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you read it, it reads like what
has the highest profit margin now that it
[SPEAKER_01]: can understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you read it and you go, oh,
cottonseed meal, soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the other one that's really
popular that's highly contaminated?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cotton and soy are two of the big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you'll see bone meal and blood
meal and all these waste sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, if you're a fertilizer
manufacturer, you'd be like, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got some waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have it for free?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you clean up a shop for him,
handle the freight.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how a lot of these fertilizer
businesses came to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I'm reading a box that says
cottonseed meal, magnesium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: bone meal, I'm just reading cheapest shit
on the market with the widest profit
[SPEAKER_01]: margin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you think about cotton,
it's not fed to animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be literally sprayed at harvest
to make clothing out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as you do that and you've
taken what's made for cotton, all the
[SPEAKER_01]: waste is now considered approved for
organic use.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very toxic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now people are caring more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously, there's been huge instances
where some of that waste killed big
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens and they had to do research about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: About how it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you go to the typical garden
store and comparing it to Craft Blend,
[SPEAKER_01]: night and day difference in the quality of
inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we continue to produce it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nightmare to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, truckloads of materials from all
over the country have to land and be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all 13 ingredients or something have
to be on the ground at one time and
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple thousands of pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have to weigh them and mix them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of wish we hadn't done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, eventually it
might get big enough where we can have
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a machine that helps us with all of
the blending of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like we should also quickly
touch upon container size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems with organics, it's often said
that the bigger the pot size, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about pot size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a bigger buffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I mean by that is if you're in a
small container, it's doable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I first started learning,
Gascanistan was on the forum and showing
[SPEAKER_01]: his growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us borrowed from the vision we
saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had like a room that was full of like
Home Depot buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were like 100 of them there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were just stacked bamboo poles
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like you're going to gouge an
eye out just walking in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was in five gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would literally just dump it out in
a tarp, reamend it and plug it back in and
[SPEAKER_01]: go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, dude, that is epic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And around that time, a lot of people were
saying, well, what happens if I just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: dump my soil out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were just making compost teas and
keeping the same five gallon there and
[SPEAKER_01]: planting right back into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became clear that if we grew a
pretty big plant, a five gallon container
[SPEAKER_01]: was almost root bound and cannibalized to
the point where reamending it or recycling
[SPEAKER_01]: it was probably the better way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to offset that, we didn't want all
the labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like literally dumping a hundred pots on
the ground in a tarp, shoveling it and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting it back in was, it's no small
task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while it sounds great on paper,
when it's the fifth time you've done it
[SPEAKER_01]: and you just don't want to do it anymore,
you're looking for a better way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the no-till became the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mountain Organics, Blue Jay away at
the time, was starting to do back to back
[SPEAKER_01]: no-till cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody was increasing container
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of guys were growing like hundred
gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we wanted to see how far that
went.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like there's some magic
somewhere around container size that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: still learning like a big container,
but still getting close to maxing out the
[SPEAKER_01]: volume creates a better finished product
than one that's so big you never even come
[SPEAKER_01]: close.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we found is that doubling your
container size usually increased your
[SPEAKER_01]: yield by about 60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of studies that show
why.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that plants are intelligent and
because the nutrients aren't immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: available in soil, they're dependent upon
the speed that biology can feed them at.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a five gallon container,
if we consider it like a bioreactor,
[SPEAKER_01]: we put organic amendments in and biology
breaks them down and feeds them to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When our plant really starts growing
because we get the grow room dialed,
[SPEAKER_01]: the grow lights are good, or we're in the
sun and it's just raging, good
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, greenhouse, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the biology just all of a sudden can't
keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant is growing faster than it can
keep up with.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way to bypass that is to give it more
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now the root, instead of being circling
on itself looking for new food,
[SPEAKER_01]: can just go further away from itself
looking for new food.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the world record tomato grower,
he would do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would make his own compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would make his holes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would mulch it and he would irrigate
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then he'd go plant vetch, a nitrogen
fixing plant, like eight to ten feet
[SPEAKER_01]: behind his rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would grow and fix nitrogen in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plants got bigger in their
growing season, their roots would tap into
[SPEAKER_01]: the nitrogen vetch produced and then hit a
circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a surge of growth and they would
never run out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bigger container size started
being the mimicking of the earth of what
[SPEAKER_01]: would produce more yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can see the guys in Cali would
put 400 gallon containers out,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow 99 plants and they were all 10 pounds
plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew bigger could be bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as indoor goes, if you're
calling a four by four space your space,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people were hesitant to add more
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like five gallons, a big
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's plenty big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you do it for a while,
it just seems so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look around, you're like, well,
I can fit way more in the same four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm growing four plants and five gallon
buckets, what's the difference if I just
[SPEAKER_01]: make them 30 gallons?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still a four by four grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we found was the difference was
significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a 30 gallon or a hundred gallon,
something that really was more soil per
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five gallons times four, that's only 20
gallons under your grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you put 30 gallons, now you're
talking 120 gallons in the same four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you just didn't run out of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't have to be an expert at feeding
and making the right tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you were done, you used less
than half of what was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could arguably guess with some
craft blend and still have a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: balanced soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we tried to do, just like life
is take our highs and take our lows and
[SPEAKER_01]: flatten them to a curve that was more
manageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big container of soil makes the big
harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like you're depleting the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you flatten that curve,
it seems like everybody gets better
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are there people that are using
smaller containers and living soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times they'll use maybe a little
bit less light intensity to grow really
[SPEAKER_01]: high quality without driving the plant so
fast it outpaces biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they will flip to flower significantly
sooner, or they will put it out on the
[SPEAKER_01]: patio when it's just a small tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically not trying to overgrow
what they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think in living soil,
what we need to do is picture the final
[SPEAKER_01]: size of our plant and try and match the
soil somewhat similarly to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: as above, so below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no breaking that rule when it
comes to organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to fill a four by four canopy
completely full of yield, I think the best
[SPEAKER_01]: way is to fill it full of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the other side of it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're brand new, if you really don't
know about watering, you could easily
[SPEAKER_01]: underwater or overwater a hundred gallon
plant much easier than a five gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The five gallon or a 10 gallon,
you can lift it and you can go,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's way too heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even I can tell that I'm brand new,
but that seems way heavier than day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably has plenty of water where
when you have a hundred gallon or several
[SPEAKER_01]: thirties, you're kind of slapping them and
lifting them and like, I don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then it becomes that you must know
that your watering style is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some rules of thumb for that,
but that really does determine your
[SPEAKER_01]: container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will ask me how to choose
their container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always recommend maxing out as much
as you're comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always the better answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The caveat is learning to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a four by four space, I love doing
15 to 30 gallons times four or a hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon or a big planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in a four by four, I prefer a three by
three planter.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to use something square,
then I can step a foot in and reach to the
[SPEAKER_01]: back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can have some airflow where the tents
not right on my grow container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a five by five tent would be great for
a four by four, but these are rules of
[SPEAKER_01]: thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can break every one of these rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why experts can break rules is
they know the consequences of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: they offset it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a small container and
that's all you can do, keep your light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity a little lower, keep your plants
a little smaller before you go into
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that would make significant
quality differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: In organics, we're not trying to just
maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to increase yield so long as
quality is brought up with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if there's a cost in quality,
we'd prefer not to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that people listening to this
may be encouraged to go up slightly in
[SPEAKER_01]: container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that 10 to 15 gallons is the
minimum to start no tilling.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, you can definitely do
fives, but it's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our last 10 by 10 series are five gallon
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had three of them on a drip system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were ugly the whole way and harder to
deal with and took more daily interaction,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they produced what's finished product
now is you wouldn't be able to tell the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's arguably just as good, if not better
than the other ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was better than the other was the
yield and the effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got way more yield for way less effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, that's why bigger containers is
very attractive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about building the soil,
you know, 33, 33, 33, adding the initial
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these initial amendments, they're
going to break down and the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake the nutrients and the soil can get
depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes additional feedings are
required throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: When does the first feeding typically,
I know it's going to depend on pot size
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that, but generally
speaking, when do you first look to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that first feeding and what does it
consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a couple of ways to look at
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started, most of us had bare
soil on top, no mulch, no top dressing,
[SPEAKER_01]: just rich organic soil that we mixed
according to these recipes, put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: container and you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we would all do is before the
plant showed any hunger, just maybe once a
[SPEAKER_01]: week or a few weeks after we got started
and the plants were visibly growing
[SPEAKER_01]: happily and we know they're stable now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we just brew compost teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back then, a micro man, Tim Wilson,
great guy, totally transparent with info.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would geek out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'd be like, you need 1.34% of this and
what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were all trying those recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And essentially the most basic recipe was
worm castings, molasses, and you'd bubble
[SPEAKER_01]: it for 24 to 48 hours and you'd water it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of things that
happened from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is we made a lot of micro microbes and
when we poured them in the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if they did nothing but die,
their dead micro bodies would feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't have to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, the molasses has some
trace minerals in there and the compost
[SPEAKER_01]: had some NPK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So making these compost teas once a week
or so usually got great results,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we wanted more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we started to find out that is
in organic farming, you would apply what
[SPEAKER_01]: they call a side dress or a top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's some implications to what that
meant, but essentially, the way the forest
[SPEAKER_01]: does it, if we're trying to mimic nature,
is the forest drops all its leaves and it
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly starts to break down and animals
die and bugs die and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that eventually feeds the soil and it
takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fungus is what really built our
forests here and built our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And worms eventually kind of took over and
they're now part of that process,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they were an invader.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, worms build soil, fungus build
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we started looking at how we
would want to feed it, we said,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, how would we make nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, no fertilizer salesman is going to
the Redwood forest and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you need a little more nitrogen to
grow 200 feet taller.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in a living soil, we started
thinking, instead of mixing it in there
[SPEAKER_01]: where it has to be accurate or it could be
too much, what if we just started pouring
[SPEAKER_01]: it on top?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to tell you, at that time,
everybody was doing the opposite of
[SPEAKER_01]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were doing subcool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And subcool was great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: He would mix a really potent soil with
tons of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since it was just off the chart,
full of nutrients, you couldn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: plant right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some plants maybe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of these land racy plants,
they just did not want the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you would do is you would put that
in the bottom of your pot, this spicy,
[SPEAKER_01]: rich soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put a really light soil with
no nutrients on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea was you put your plant in and it
doesn't go into the hot nutrients until
[SPEAKER_01]: it's ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's balanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nature does it the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has all of the minerals and water down
below with no nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it pours all the nutrients right on
top and slowly decays them into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as such, the plants have actually
developed this feeder root system that
[SPEAKER_01]: lives up top to eat the food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it develops these water tapers that go
down to get water and minerals deep from
[SPEAKER_01]: the earth, depending on the type of plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in living soil, what we do is right
away, you don't have to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we mix it in the soil,
it could be too much if we overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you put the 15 gallon pot,
let's say, of your homemade three part
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe, and you put the plant into it,
you could literally top dress some
[SPEAKER_01]: craftland or your homemade version,
put some more worm castings on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: cover it with mulch and put a few worms
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do that day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why, like if you buy a Fox
farm, they say don't feed it for a few
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, is it's already charged with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in our soil, it's charged with
amendments that are going to take time to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we want that to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a balanced amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we put stuff on top, we're day
one creating the biomimic of the forest
[SPEAKER_01]: that's eventually going to start adding
food from the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that as our plant grows and it
eats the soil we made for it, it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to go, I wonder where my food is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to start reaching up to the
top, putting feeder roots up there,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if we use mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll say, oh, here, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got more food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can feed it right to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you develop, this is game
changer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to top dress and not a lot would
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would take weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you'd water it in and kind of
go in there, eventually it would break
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we added worms that would eat it
and immediately make it available,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we covered it with straw, some mulch
of some sort, it became shady.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light wasn't hitting it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms would go right up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fungus was growing underneath it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden the feeder roots would
literally set up shop and they would hang
[SPEAKER_01]: and wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And next time you top dress, you could see
the roots like literally matted right
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would start to work on your top
dress within days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of a sudden it became, oh,
you got to be three weeks ahead in
[SPEAKER_01]: organics too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if I build from day one,
this feeder root system, I could go top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress every couple of weeks if I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to make immediate good
use of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if any is left over, well,
it's on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that we found is that
plants, annual flowering plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: when they go to die, like they've lived
their time, they're going to die whether
[SPEAKER_01]: they have nutrients or not, which means
they're not going to just be continually
[SPEAKER_01]: force feeding themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to stop taking up nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them now, the idea is that they
will stop if they can.
[SPEAKER_01]: In hydro they can't because they need
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the nutrients are already in the
water, which means for them to drink means
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to get nutrients whether
they like it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in soil where you have underground
aquifers and food up top, the plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: almost start to self-fade, to senescence
is what they call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if there's an abundance of food
in the top dressing, so long as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: slowing watering down and the biology is
not breaking it down completely because
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant roots have said, I don't need it
anymore, the plant will still fade and it
[SPEAKER_01]: will still senesce even though there's
nutrients in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which sets you up for the next round
without completely depleting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the new grower that's setting up
their container, don't be scared to top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress right in the beginning because by
the time you get into full fruit
[SPEAKER_01]: production and flowering, that top dress
will start to be available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I build what I call the
check-in account that's in the mix and
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be available and the savings
account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when your plant can say, oh,
my check-in account is pretty good,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my savings account is great,
it will put more fruit out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where if you don't have any of that,
even though your soil is good,
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant's not stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna put out more than would
kill itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you might be cheating your plant by
not building that checking and savings
[SPEAKER_01]: account.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's what's nice is in a big,
big container, you can put less in your
[SPEAKER_01]: savings account across the surface and the
plant will react better because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger buffer of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if one cup was the perfect amount in
a five gallon, well, it might be a 10 cup
[SPEAKER_01]: range in a big hundred gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could over-under do it without
causing a problem and that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: container size comes back into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now feeding, compost teas I'm never scared
of, but if you're buying like liquid fish
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything that's arguably potent,
I want you to wait in your soil recipe
[SPEAKER_01]: until the plant starts to show some
hunger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning in living soil, you'll start to
see like dark green will be just a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit lighter hue of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you're growing, you'll start to
think, oh, she's hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants are a little bit, they want
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can start to feed those liquids at
that point, but they're so instantly
[SPEAKER_01]: available you can't guess about the head
of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can with organic amendments,
if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's episodes like this where I wish
this podcast was two hours, but it's only
[SPEAKER_00]: one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just scratched the surface on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many other things that we can
talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling the audience is going to
be demanding a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe in the future we could do a part
two and kind of pick up what we left off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could get into IPM,
seed sprouted teas, cover crotch,
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch layers, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would make for a great part
two.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're willing to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be willing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want basically like, I also practice
jiu-jitsu.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I learned there is that
the black belt to be the best teacher,
[SPEAKER_01]: he literally has to teach the fundamental
basics every day over and over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's all that matters when they
win competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it's a day one move they used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this base recipe could be all that
you ever need to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people don't require getting
their black belt and learning the nuances
[SPEAKER_01]: of shit that just doesn't really help them
get any further.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, I would be honored
to do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of these with you and hoping that maybe
instead of me saying it over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: again, they can just go to the episode and
watch it from different people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've also learned from jiu-jitsu
is that just because one black belt told
[SPEAKER_01]: me doesn't mean I don't want to hear it
from a dozen others that might describe it
[SPEAKER_01]: differently and help my brain understand
and fully connect it and internalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, for whatever reason, your viewers
really like the way your style of
[SPEAKER_01]: answering and asking questions and our
growers like what I do, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so combining our efforts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think reaches more people and I'd love
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, IPM could be a whole episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we can really go down the rabbit hole
soil testing, all this, but from today,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I want people to get from it is that
soil building.
[SPEAKER_01]: If following some good principles doesn't
have to be rocket science and they should,
[SPEAKER_01]: they should absolutely, even if you don't
stop what you're doing, add one new thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and make some soil from scratch,
get your own hands in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll never go back if you try
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: coin in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build a soil.com is the best way to find
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a YouTube at build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can come down to the store
anytime, see our vegetable farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: see our indoor grow here where we
demonstrate all of it's very transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Montrose, Colorado in Western
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, beyond that, as far as the future
goes, we have a number of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working on right now, um,
that we'll be sharing soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a new powdered veg growing
product that helps if you're in small or
[SPEAKER_01]: containers helps if you need something for
foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we'll be releasing that soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, otherwise most of what we're working
on at build a soil is just quality control
[SPEAKER_01]: and scalability without giving up on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a lot of logistics and
boring business stuff we could talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: all day, but I'm more excited to talk
about the soil stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as new, a lot of it's just old
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing terribly new coming out,
just a repeat of the mantra of the build a
[SPEAKER_01]: soil way of mimicking nature and using
what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I mentioned in the beginning of
this episode, I will have a link to
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy's channel down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed this video, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also love to know in the comments section
below, do you want a part two?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, put part two in the comment section
and let us know some organic methods that
[SPEAKER_00]: you do, you know, whether it be building
soil or feedings, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hear about that in the comments
because there are so many different ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to do this and sharing those best
practices within the comments,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think can be value added for many
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're tuning in, I wanted to talk
about the podcast platforms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please leave a rating and review,
particularly Apple podcasts, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: subscribe to the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already every single week,
I'm releasing these garden talk podcast
[SPEAKER_00]: episodes and I would love for you to tune
into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeremy, once again, thank you so much for
coming on to this episode today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a banger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of people that are
going to have value from the information
[SPEAKER_00]: you put out and keep doing what you're
doing, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a nice shirt, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to represent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to follow that, that's a build
a soil family farms on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll put it up on YouTube this year as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that if you guys have questions
and you ask them on the Mr. Grow it on
[SPEAKER_01]: this episode, I'm going to go in
afterwards in the comments and I'll try
[SPEAKER_01]: and answer anything that I maybe missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please ask anything relative to the
content today and I'll be sure to answer
[SPEAKER_01]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you in the next episode.
