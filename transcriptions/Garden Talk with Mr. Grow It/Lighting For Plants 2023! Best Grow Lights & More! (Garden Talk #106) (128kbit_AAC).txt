[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the Garden Talk Podcast,
this episode number 106.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you caught the episode I did with
him last week, where he talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in Coco coir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, he's back again for this
back-to-back episode special, and this
[SPEAKER_00]: week he's going to talk all about LED grow
lights, another area where his knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: goes deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only does he talk about LED grow
lights versus other types of lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he also gets into things to look for
in an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about the grow light calculator
he created, talks about some of the best
[SPEAKER_00]: LED grow lights on the market today here
in 2023, and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a quick announcement that I
wanted to mention before we get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have launched a clips channel on
YouTube, so basically these Garden Talk
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast episodes will be cut down into
smaller clips, bite-sized chunks,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'll be on that clips channel,
new clip every single day, so check out
[SPEAKER_00]: that channel, simply search Garden Talk
clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a link in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to acknowledge that one of my goals
for this podcast is to bring free
[SPEAKER_00]: information about gardening, all plants,
to the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different series LED grow
lights, the Ion Board and the Ion Grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Ion Board fixtures are board style and
use Samsung LM301B diodes, while the Ion
[SPEAKER_00]: Grid series has an open center design and
uses Samsung LM301H diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: these grow lights, and the discount code
MRGROW15 works on both Amazon and their
[SPEAKER_00]: website.
[SPEAKER_00]: ACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me back on the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, back to back episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time we've ever done that on the
Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys missed last week's episode,
I sat down with Dr. MJ Coco and we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have a lot of knowledge
when it comes to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I want to get into in this
episode because really lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, general, I know we can narrow
down the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting is such a broad topic,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we can narrow it down to LEDs,
I'm sure there's going to be some
[SPEAKER_00]: overlapping with other lighting as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, looking forward to picking your
brain on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, you know, understanding light
is something that a lot of farmers take
[SPEAKER_01]: for granted because you're growing
outdoors under the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I didn't think about a
whole lot until I became an indoor grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: an indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, understanding how to deal with
horticultural lighting and what we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand about it and, you know,
how to effectively deploy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we were talking in the first episode we
did, you know, the cost of running those
[SPEAKER_01]: lights is just such a huge part of sort of
what we're doing as growers that really
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding what light is, how light
works, what we need, how to get it can
[SPEAKER_01]: really improve the efficiency in your
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a key component of the grow,
that is for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm Dr. MJ Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to just, you know, share
scientifically sound knowledge about how
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow soilless and beyond just getting
into growing in cocoa like we talked about
[SPEAKER_01]: last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how to grow effectively,
how to understand the various aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: that are really sort of scientific around
being an effective indoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: doing effective indoor horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not just sort of understanding
fertilization, root health, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation, those kinds of issues,
different growing media.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we're talking about now,
lighting is such a huge aspect of indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not, you know, whether you're
growing in living soil or rock wool or
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa or whatever other media,
you know, it's applicable to all growers
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand how to effectively use
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's my background.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a PhD in agricultural and economic
anthropology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked with farmers from Central America
and southern Mexico and really got into
[SPEAKER_01]: studying the science of indoor
horticulture right after I got back from
college.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got back from doing my dissertation
field work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I told you last time,
you know, kind of took that same approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have training as a graduate student
and as a professor and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: access to those materials and sort of that
background in terms of how to approach
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things when I really
started getting into the online growing
[SPEAKER_01]: community was the amount of like bro
science, the amount of sort of things that
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't valid that a lot of growers
believed in and still practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, more so in certain online
growing communities than in others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I definitely saw the need to just sort
of provide accessible knowledge to growers
[SPEAKER_01]: that was scientifically valid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've tried to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, getting into lighting was
we're going to get into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been my big project for the last
several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that gets me excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the middle of testing light right
now, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and doing that kind of primary
research, basically doing my own tests and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how lights work,
because I get my hands on a lot of them
[SPEAKER_01]: has been a really exciting part of
learning about how lights work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's not exciting for everybody,
but it's certainly exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start off with the basics here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing about 13 years ago and
there was no LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was HPS, MH and HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And flowering under HPS, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, I got my first LED in
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it seems like everybody's buying
LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was your first LED back in 2015?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was P9XML2 by PlatinumLED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Old school.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually funny thing is they're
still selling that light today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was released in 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, OK, outdated, but OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are coming along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: That whole horticultural, the revolution
that we've seen in the last 10 years in
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural lighting, basically from,
you know, 2012 to 2022 or so was just such
[SPEAKER_01]: an exciting and dynamic time where the
whole industry just kind of flipped on
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs not only sort of came to the
mainstream, but became more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sort of the first wave was LEDs
became more efficient than the gas
[SPEAKER_01]: discharge lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the costs of the LEDs came down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened in sort of two distinct
movements, like from 2012 to 2016,
[SPEAKER_01]: the capacity for LEDs to really perform
better than the gas discharge lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I mean, and it became obvious by the
end of that period that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs were were better than gas discharge
lights, but they were super expensive at
[SPEAKER_01]: that point to get good ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of crappy ones that
started entering the market, but to get
[SPEAKER_01]: good ones, they were really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, since like 2016 to 2022,
the prices have just come down as more and
[SPEAKER_01]: more manufacturing has come online.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as the full spectrum diodes in
particular have found more mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: applications and been manufactured in
larger and larger quantities that the unit
[SPEAKER_01]: prices drop significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's allowed, you know, all
manufacturers to produce lights that are
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, even cheap lights these
days that now not all lights, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: still get you can certainly get some cheap
lights on like Amazon that are better than
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that was available in 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better than, you know, your first Cobb and
they are still selling some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's just it's tremendous how we've
seen that sort of the the technology
[SPEAKER_01]: progress and then the prices collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I lived through that time as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's crazy to see the way it
went.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's start from the beginning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just basics LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they actually?
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are used make the use of
semiconductors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So semiconductor is just material that
doesn't conduct electricity well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It conducts electricity sort of somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's semi conductive, and that's why it's
called a semiconductor.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs in particular use a PN type
semiconductor where, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: electrons are basically pushed from P type
material to N type material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as they cross that juncture,
the electrons are forced to to descend in
[SPEAKER_01]: orbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As they descend in orbit, they lose energy
and we can we can by selecting the right
[SPEAKER_01]: semiconductor materials, sort of make the
electron lose the right amount of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: and it will produce a photon of a specific
amount of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, a semiconductor,
basically we just push electricity through
[SPEAKER_01]: this material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the electrons and I'm sorry,
they move from the end type to the P type
[SPEAKER_01]: material, as they move across there,
they release this energy that is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: form of an electron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each semiconductor will lead to a specific
drop in energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as it moves from the end type to the P
type, it's got to, you know, drop so many
[SPEAKER_01]: band levels, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that determines how much energy it has
to release.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that determines the wavelength of the
photon that's created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different wavelengths photons have
different sort of amounts of energy in
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a lot of energy in the
photon, then it's going to be blue or
[SPEAKER_01]: ultraviolet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's less energy in the photon,
then it's going to be red or infrared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single photon that comes out of
a semiconductor is going to have basically
[SPEAKER_01]: the same amount of energy and be basically
the same wavelength because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: determined by the specific materials that
are used in the P and N type material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of how far that electron has to drop
as it crosses the junction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could get deeper and deeper into that,
but it gets sort of deeper and deeper into
[SPEAKER_01]: quite literally theoretical physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we won't get too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do over some of these beginner's
heads here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But appreciate the explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So electricity sort of gets pushed through
a semiconductor and energy is released by
[SPEAKER_01]: controlling the materials in the
semiconductor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tune it up so that almost all of
the energy that's released comes off as
[SPEAKER_01]: light because it could also come off as
heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one area where different kinds
of semiconductors are more or less
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first part of the sort of
historical trend, where we're going from
[SPEAKER_01]: 2012 to 2016, we saw tremendous gains in
the semiconductor materials that were used
[SPEAKER_01]: to really make it so more and more of the
energy was being released as light and
[SPEAKER_01]: less and less of the energy was being
released as heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really how semiconductors
became so much more sort of efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, the 450 nanometer
semiconductors are 90% efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 90% of the power that we drive to them,
and this is blue, 450 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the energy that sort of is consumed
becomes blue light energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And laws of physics suggest that we can't
get more than 100% of the energy consumed
[SPEAKER_01]: to be blue light energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're already at 90%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So LEDs, those semiconductors,
especially the blue semiconductors,
[SPEAKER_01]: are sort of reaching the maximum of
efficiency, what we could ever expect out
[SPEAKER_01]: of any lighting technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of growers ask, what's next?
[SPEAKER_01]: And isn't there going to be some new
revolution that replaces LEDs and gets us
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are twice as good as HPS is something
else going to come along that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be twice as good as LEDs?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it can't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a violation of the laws of physics.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs, like HPS was 40% efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs are like 80% efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the blue chips, like I just said,
are up to 90% efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're running out of room to continue to
sort of grow that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about the spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the spectrum you can get with LEDs,
it can be different than the traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people claim that the HPS is a
closer spectrum to the sun than any LED
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about like the spectrum
differences between LEDs, what you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: out of LEDs versus what you can get out of
some of the other traditional lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each semiconductor creates one
wavelength of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a 660 nanometer semiconductor creates
photons from like 655 to 665 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're all right in this really
narrow little range of spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 450 nanometer semiconductors are
almost exactly at 450.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like every photon coming out of that,
they're monochromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create one color of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earlier generations of LEDs used blue
diodes and they used red diodes in sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: conjunction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, because you have
semiconductors that create blue light and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have semiconductors that create red
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no semiconductors that create
quote unquote white light.
[SPEAKER_01]: White light is the combination of several
different spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have photons at different
wavelengths all coming together that
[SPEAKER_01]: create white light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting that you don't need a lot of
all of the different lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have a lot of red and a lot of
blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you have some greens and
yellows, the light looks pretty white.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you only have red and blue,
the light looks blurple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growers that have been around the
block for a few years know what blurple
[SPEAKER_01]: light looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly not white and it's not
pleasant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't really see your plants under it
very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the big problems with
blurple light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they do to create white light or
white diodes is they start with the 450
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometer blue semiconductor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they use phosphor in the glue
that sort of holds that semiconductor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that phosphor distributes the energy
to the other spectral brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're able to sort of, what you're
basically doing there, blue photons at 450
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometers have a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red photons at like 650 to 700 nanometers
have less energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you push those blue photons
through a media like phosphor that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: strips them of some of their energy,
some of those photons become redder and it
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of diffuses the light through the
spectrum to create that white tint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now all full spectrum diodes are heavy on
blue because they are blue semiconductors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at this spectral output
sort of diagram of what the diodes
[SPEAKER_01]: produce, they all have a strong peak at
450 nanometers because they're using 450
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometer semiconductors to create the
light sort of in the first place,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll have a secondary peak out
usually at 650, 660 in the high 600s
[SPEAKER_01]: there, which is where most of the photons
got sort of filtered to as they pass
[SPEAKER_01]: through the phosphor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some photons will land in the middle
and these are green and yellow spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you're throwing a bunch of photons
out towards the high 600s, you end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: some in the high 400s, 500s, low 600s,
even out to the 700s and sort of beyond,
[SPEAKER_01]: some photons get sort of slowed down more.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not slowed down, stripped of more
energy because all photons travel at the
[SPEAKER_01]: speed of light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some like longer wavelength photons travel
at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get from like this side of the
screen to this side of the screen like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like maybe one wave, like 800
nanometer or 650 nanometer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you get like 450 nanometer,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 nanometer, you have to like start
vibrating more in the same space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now every single photon gets from here to
here in the same amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have to do 20 vibrations,
that's more energy than if you only have
[SPEAKER_01]: to do one vibration in that time,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So blue photons vibrate faster than red
photons in that case, but they all travel
[SPEAKER_01]: at the speed of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now light like HPS or the other,
you know, gas discharge light,
[SPEAKER_01]: they create light in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They basically heat up elements that
create different gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they bombard those gases with
electrons.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the electrons hit different gases,
they gain energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as they fall back down to their
original energy level, they release
[SPEAKER_01]: photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since those collisions happen somewhat
chaotically, that, you know, they go to
[SPEAKER_01]: different heights and they fall down at
different heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they create a blend of photons across
different spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to change the spectrum in gas
discharge lighting, you change the gaseous
[SPEAKER_01]: elements that are gonna be vaporized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, sodium and different,
mercury and different things can be
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporized and bombarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the way fluorescent lights work
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluorescent lights vaporize mercury and
then bombard it with photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, the photons sort of hit it,
they gain energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when a photon or when an electron,
sorry, electron loses energy, it will
[SPEAKER_01]: release a photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That energy becomes a photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one side, very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we can do with LEDs is we
can target spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can create a diode at 660
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And grow lights all use, not all,
but almost all of them use 660 nanometer
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes because, you know, the full
spectrum are really four 50 nanometer
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes that are throwing some portion of
their energy out to the red, but not
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're strong in blue and sort of weaker
in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: So grow light manufacturers add red to
their, you know, add specific red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red diodes, which are super efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The red diodes are only like 70% energy
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since red photons have less energy,
you actually get more photons per watt
[SPEAKER_01]: with the red diode than you do with the
blue diode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the best blue diodes are like 3.2,
3.3, like the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue diodes, 3.2, 3.3.
[SPEAKER_01]: Micromoles of photons per watt of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best red 660 nanometer photons are
over four micromoles of photons per watt
[SPEAKER_01]: of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though they're less energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically four micromoles worth of red
photons have less energy than three
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles of blue photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plants don't really care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants care about how many photons are
hitting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants care less about sort of how much
energy is in each individual photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants respond just as well to a red
photon as they do to a blue photon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing we're able to do with LEDs is
give them more red photons, which we're
[SPEAKER_01]: able to create really efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sort of spike our efficiency numbers
by targeting the red photons with a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific semiconductor that very
efficiently creates those photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not filtered through anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gas discharge, if you want to change the
spectrum, you either change the elements
[SPEAKER_01]: that are getting heated and that the
electrons are colliding with, or you
[SPEAKER_01]: filter the light with variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anytime you filter the light,
you lose efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability of LEDs to create any
specific spectrum of light is one of LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: significant advantages really,
because we can target things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to at least mention the
other side of this, which is sort of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what spectrum do we want for different
plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: What spectrum are we trying to create?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still some really exciting
research on that, really exciting research
[SPEAKER_01]: into how much far-red light might be
beneficial for plants, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best research suggests that plants
want at least a distribution of light
[SPEAKER_01]: energy sources such that the blur poles
weren't terribly red.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't measurable in that they did
target sort of the 450 and the 650 ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they weren't sort of just drilling in
on one photo system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're activating both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants do better, really, with a full
spectrum light, but they're most
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthetically responsive to the blue
light and to the red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adding green and yellow light,
the primary importance of that is for us
[SPEAKER_01]: as growers to be able to see our plants
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we grow just under blurple,
blue, and red light, it's really hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify plant nutrient deficiencies,
pest issues, overall plant health issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you just don't get to see your
plant very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of photosynthetic response,
plants grown under blurple lights do
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty well vis-a-vis plants grown under
full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights during vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants grown under monochromatic light,
so only blue or only red light,
[SPEAKER_01]: don't do very well during vegetative
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: During flowering or reproductive growth,
for most plants, there's less significance
[SPEAKER_01]: on spectrum, more significance on flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much light the plant is harvesting
as opposed to what specific sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: qualities the lights are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of growers think that the
specific spectrum that you give,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially during the flowering phase,
is going to be sort of the key to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality or to getting the best out of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have really any scientific
research to support those beliefs.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the research that's been done on
flowering plants and altering the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: really suggests that altering the spectrum
has almost no impact on harvest yield or
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know that during vegetative growth,
plants will respond differently to red
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy spectra versus blue heavy spectra.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we redshift our vegetating light,
then the plants will grow lankier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evolutionarily, red light is usually
filtered through something, so it sends a
[SPEAKER_01]: signal to the plant that you're growing
under somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better kind of get taller and get up
above them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they try to stretch more, often in a
way that we as growers don't want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They become too sort of stretched out and
lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't want to put them under too
much red light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why back in the days that we did
HPS and metal halide, we'd veg under metal
[SPEAKER_01]: halide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because metal halide were better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because metal halide have less red in
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plants wouldn't sort of grow too
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of growers got the idea that we
switched to HPS because HPS was better
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum for flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS are more efficient than metal halide,
and plants don't really care what spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: they're flowered under.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we veg plants under HPS,
they grow too lanky.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'd veg plants under metal halide,
and then we'd switch them to HPS because
[SPEAKER_01]: HPS is more efficient, not necessarily
because it's going to produce sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: better harvest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would produce higher yields,
but the higher yield was because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in efficiency for the same sort
of wattage output.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to say that we want to
distribute the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding something about spectrum,
especially during vegetative plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetating growth is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a lot of growers sort of think
that there's some magic in spectrum during
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have anything in sort of the
scientific data that suggests that that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you getting into so much
detail in regards to spectrum and
[SPEAKER_00]: clarifying some things that were incorrect
over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into kind of what to look
for in an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different things that you
can look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you created a grow light
calculator, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hoping you can talk about that here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what should folks be looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Since you mentioned spectrum, you already
talked about that as something to look at
[SPEAKER_00]: and what to look at within the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But PAR, efficiency of the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the kind of like the top things
people should look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are so many different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get confused pretty easily when it
comes to shopping for an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first we just got to break light into
two parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light as a particle, light as a wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far we've been talking about light as a
wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been talking about spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about different nanometers
of wavelength.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red light versus blue light, how all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all light as a wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light is also a particle, photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what really matters, that side flux,
what we call flux, the amount of photons
[SPEAKER_01]: basically that are hitting the plant,
the amount of radiated energy that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be hitting the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more important for almost all
reasons than spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of growers get caught up
thinking about spectrum and they think
[SPEAKER_01]: about different colors of light and all of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the overall amount of light is what
ultimately really matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost every grow light has a decent
enough spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sort of knock a lot of grow lights
because they have a terrible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll certainly knock them because they
don't produce enough photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't have enough efficiency in
producing their photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to talk about counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Counting photons and understanding how
many photons your grow light will produce
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a number.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're talking about micromoles,
we're talking about a number of photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of it as a quantity of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every grow light can produce a certain
quantity of light per second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we call the PPF,
the photosynthetic photon flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: That total amount of light that's created
per second, there's different ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just say, hey, I'm using these
diodes that get 3.2 micromoles per watt
[SPEAKER_01]: and I got 100 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got 320 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could just do a calculation like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of grow light companies do exactly
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see a number often advertised
for their PPF, that's just a calculation
[SPEAKER_01]: of what the diode could theoretically do
times the number of watts that are being
[SPEAKER_01]: driven through this fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of BS because it's not
reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call that the calculated PPF,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what they do based on the
published numbers of the components that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we could do to measure the
amount of light that a grow light fixture
[SPEAKER_01]: creates is we could stick it in a device
called an integrating sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an integrating sphere measures what we
call the total PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually counts each photon that comes
out of that fixture, each and every
[SPEAKER_01]: photon, no matter where it goes,
basically, unless it hits the grow light
[SPEAKER_01]: fixture itself, because it's in the
integrating sphere and gets converted to
[SPEAKER_01]: heat by hitting the grow light fixture
itself, it's going to be counted by the
[SPEAKER_01]: integrating sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we call that the total PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of better grow light
manufacturers will have their lights
[SPEAKER_01]: sphere tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll report a sphere test
number, usually out to two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: decimal places.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see a sphere test number,
they're going to advertise something like,
[SPEAKER_01]: our fixture gets 2.379 micromoles per
joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not just going to say 3.4 or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have that finer
granularity because they actually ran a
[SPEAKER_01]: test.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually have something that
they're reporting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't grow our plants in a sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't grow our plants on the inside of
an integrating sphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow our plants usually in a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a sphere is an over count of how many
photons will actually hit your plants in a
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want a better understanding of
what a grow light is going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: deliver to the canopy of your garden,
then you want to look at a PAR test
[SPEAKER_01]: result, a well set up PAR test can measure
what we call the usable PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the usable PPF is the number of
photons that actually are going to hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I try to measure in my PAR
tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you set up a fixture the way it could
be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you measure how many photons
actually arrive to the canopy of that
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're doing there is we're using a
quantum sensor, a PAR sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is actually measuring PPF D.
[SPEAKER_01]: The D stands for density.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not, the sensor doesn't count the
total number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't know the total number of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just knows the number that are hitting
the sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it says, well, this is how dense the
photons are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically hitting this sensor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we take a good sample across a PAR test
like that, then we can extrapolate from
[SPEAKER_01]: that density across the area, the size of
the area that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, and that gets us to the quantity,
the overall quantity of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot into PPF, but PPF,
whether it's calculated PPF, whether it's
[SPEAKER_01]: total PPF, or whether it's usable PPF,
are metrics to describe the total amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of light that a fixture will produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what our calculator sort of
fundamentally works with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the amount of light that a grow
light fixture creates determines how much
[SPEAKER_01]: area that grow light can cover at a given
density, a density of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a thousand micromoles of
light, and you want 500 micromoles per
[SPEAKER_01]: square meter of density, and you had
perfect distribution, which isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: realistic, but just to say, that you had
perfect distribution, then you could grow
[SPEAKER_01]: with two square meters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have a thousand micromoles
divided by two square meters would be 500
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles per square meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: That micromoles per square meter is the
PPFD measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically how we go from an
amount of light, we have an idea of how
[SPEAKER_01]: much density we wanna grow with what the
plants can tolerate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how much space a different grow
light will be able to cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grow light calculator sort of works
with those numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if a grow light will tell you
something, like, this grow light gets 2.8
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles per joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be all you know about the
grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should assume that that number is a
calculated PPE, that's photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: photon efficacy, but it relates to PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the total amount of photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take that 2.8 over to our grow
light calculator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take that 2.8 and plug that into the
micromoles per joule tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how many watts does grow light
say it has?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, a hundred watt light,
just for simplistic reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you put that in the watt field,
and then you put the cost, which it just
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to do the cost efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'd be able to select is this
total PPF?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I think that they actually did a sphere
test?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll call it total PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I think that this is just a number that
they calculated?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'll call it calculated PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the calculator will make its own
conversions based on, all right,
[SPEAKER_01]: if that's calculated PPF, this is what we
would expect it to be able to do in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of usable PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the big things that the
calculator does is convert between those
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of PPF.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some actually more simple
calculations about how much area could
[SPEAKER_01]: this grow light cover?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much could you reasonably expect to
harvest from such a grow light?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause all of that really is a function of
the amount of light that you're providing
[SPEAKER_01]: to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can have a fairly good estimate of
your harvest potential, not your sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: guarantee that you'll actually hit that,
but what your harvest potential is,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much coverage you could get and break
down, you know, how efficient the light is
[SPEAKER_01]: and whether or not it's a good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the calculator is designed
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number one thing, if you're out there
shopping for a grow light that I think you
[SPEAKER_01]: should pay attention to is the PARMAP.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, because the PARMAP talks about
the actual light that's hitting the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those numbers that you see in a PARMAP are
the PPFD numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the density of photons at each position
across that map.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most growers don't want to put,
unless you're supplementing carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: dioxide, you're not going to want to put
your plants under more than a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: micromoles of PPFD light, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though you can go outside in the
noon day sun and measure the sun at about
[SPEAKER_01]: 2000 PPFD, you don't want to grow plants
indoors under a steady light source at
[SPEAKER_01]: higher than a thousand PPFD because they
will have light toxicity issues if you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Supplementing CO2 can get a little bit
higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're evaluating a PARMAP,
make sure that the numbers in the middle
[SPEAKER_01]: of the PARMAP aren't above a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are, that's not a realistic map.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also not a realistic map.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're like 500, you'd probably want
more light than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to find a PARMAP with this center
value is close to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the center value is close to a
thousand, you want the corner numbers to
[SPEAKER_01]: be at least 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good distribution of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: No hotspot higher than a thousand and the
lowest areas are at least 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's sort of what I try to evaluate
in my PAR test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now make sure that it's a well-set up PAR
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's any number of ways that
manufacturers can sort of goose the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers on their own tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where possible, use a third party test
or at least be confident in how they set
[SPEAKER_01]: it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at your grow light calculator
on your website right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember when you first came out
with us, this was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I really like about it is if you
put the cost in there, you can see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the cost efficiency is, like how much
you're paying per micromole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool because you know, if you're
paying outrageous price for it,
[SPEAKER_00]: then the fixtures is just not worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your relationship there,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And these days that's the best way to
evaluate the cost of a grow light too,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the cost per micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you're buying is a light
creating machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much light can it create?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then divide that by the purchase cost
is what we do for cost efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say a light that can create 600
micromoles that costs $200.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a tremendous deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be like 33 cents per micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which there are some lights that are
getting towards that range down into the
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 cents per micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we started, when I did the grow light
calculator, we considered anything under a
[SPEAKER_01]: dollar to be a good deal, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the sort of price drop that we
were talking about and the efficiency gain
[SPEAKER_01]: had already happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you go back to like 2016, 2017,
2018, if you could find grow light that
[SPEAKER_01]: got better than two micromoles per watt,
you could find them, but not that was less
[SPEAKER_01]: than two micromoles per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two micromoles per dollar or $2 per
micromole basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can get them for like 40 or 50
cents per micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best deals out there like on
sales and stuff are down in the 30 cents
[SPEAKER_01]: per micromole.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the prices have been basically cut in a
third over the last four or five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really sort of tremendous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's really incredible to see that
huge price drop and it's a lot better for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers, of course, because they're
spending less money on these grow lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's creating new problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four or five years ago, I could basically
assume when I start talking to a grower
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were underlit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every grower was underlit, didn't have
really enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really actually hard to be fully lit
with HPS lighting because it's just one
[SPEAKER_01]: bulb in the center and the reflectors
aren't that great and it creates that
[SPEAKER_01]: central hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: spot and it's just hard to get sort of a
good distribution of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd always sort of end up with good
light in the middle and crappy light
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the corners if you were in a
single fixture space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And growers under LEDs four or five years
ago, man, they were all buying the lies
[SPEAKER_01]: that this 100 watt light was a thousand
watt HPS replacement or whatever and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody was underlit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since the efficiency has gone up and
the price has come down, more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are not only fully lit,
but they have the capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to be a grower that's fully lit,
but you have the capacity to be overlit
[SPEAKER_01]: and to be actually, I mean, I'm running
into more and more growers now that are
[SPEAKER_01]: creating light talks situations for their
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that used to not be a thing really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, especially amongst home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't a thing to be sort of bleaching
your buds because you actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you were HPS and you knew you were
too close to the HPS, but not just because
[SPEAKER_01]: like you had too much LED light in your
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's crazy how that's happened,
but growers can definitely be fully lit
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're seeing home growers pull down
tremendous numbers because they're great
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution of light across their tents
and really good numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too much heat either, just sort of the
other side of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talked to us about things you can
look for in an LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So neither of us are, have any exclusive
relationships with LED grow light
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're free to talk about whatever
brands we want, however we want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about them, which is fantastic here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is somewhat like the top brands or
model lights here in 2023 that you
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend people to check out?
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of depends on your price point,
to be perfectly honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think there's ways to waste a
lot of money on lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of expensive lights
on the market that for me don't justify
[SPEAKER_01]: the return on investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there is no return on investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to be aware of sort of that side,
due to the changes in the market over the
[SPEAKER_01]: last, like we've been talking about
decade, you can get really decent quality
[SPEAKER_01]: lights for not a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no reason to pay sort of a
tremendous premium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago, there was a reason to pay
a tremendous premium for LED lights
[SPEAKER_01]: because the difference between the top of
the market and the bottom of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: was really significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way you could get the high
efficiency fixtures was to shell out sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of the premium prices for those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of those companies are continuing to
try to demand a premium price,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're no longer offering sort of a
compelling advantage over lower cost
[SPEAKER_01]: competitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to be aware of that, I see a lot
of growers and I'm thinking, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: you didn't have to spend that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is really even more true in
the commercial side of growing now than in
[SPEAKER_01]: the home grow side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think it's sort of true on both
sides that there's a certain sense of
[SPEAKER_01]: luxury pricing where people think that if
I'm spending more for something,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting a better quality product.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the end, I think, you know,
you want to pay attention to these sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics that we've been talking about,
making sure you're getting a quality
[SPEAKER_01]: fixture with whatever fixture you're
getting, making sure like things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're not overpowering the
diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not sort of goosing the numbers in
that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at diode count, I think is really
something that I'd encourage you to look
[SPEAKER_01]: at even over brand of fixture,
brand of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the lower end, because you did ask
about brands, you know, I've reviewed
[SPEAKER_01]: several of the Medigrow fixtures that are
down in the 30 cents per micromole
[SPEAKER_01]: territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm working with a couple of different
commercial growers now that have used
[SPEAKER_01]: those and set up the Medigrow lights in
their facilities and have been happy with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm continuing to sort of keep my eye
on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one I've been at first reviewed,
I think about three years ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that time, I was like, this price
is too good to be true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what's the catch on this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the more mainstream discount
brands, Mars Hydro is your spider farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those sort of they do a lot of direct
marketing, they do a lot of marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: through Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a pretty big chunk of the
homegrown market in terms of market and
[SPEAKER_01]: cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of their fixtures are pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little bit more expensive,
a little bit more expensive than the
[SPEAKER_01]: Medigrow fixtures, but you know,
the pretty decent fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I from both of those companies,
Spider Farmer and Mars Hydro, I prefer
[SPEAKER_01]: their sort of more discounted line over
their more premium line.
[SPEAKER_01]: In both cases, they have a premium line
that uses the Samsung LM301B diodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: which have gotten, and we should probably
talk a little bit about that because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like the one brand name of diode that
growers really know them in the Ostram 660
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometers that growers often look for
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that sometimes gets you into
trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a good sort of case point of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spider Farmer and Mars Hydro both have
their top end product lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: That use the Samsung LM301H and Ostram 660
nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have reasonable diode quantities and
sort of a higher price tag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both those companies also have sort of a
more discounted line that uses BridgeLux
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use like three times as many
BridgeLux diodes as they use of the Ostram
[SPEAKER_01]: diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, the BridgeLux diodes are not as
high or rated for as high of wattage,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still powering them at a lower
percentage of the rated capacity than they
[SPEAKER_01]: are of the Samsungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes the BridgeLux diodes ever
so slightly more efficient than the
[SPEAKER_01]: Samsung diodes in their top end sort of
model lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though the diodes themselves
aren't quite as good, they're using so
[SPEAKER_01]: many more of them that ends up being more
efficient because you're powering them
[SPEAKER_01]: less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you power a diode at a lower
current, it's more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you try to like step on the gas,
you just get more light, but at lower and
[SPEAKER_01]: lower efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you step on the gas harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are interesting sort of things to
think about even amongst different brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving up sort of a little bit from there,
and I can just justify some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: fixtures in terms of different features
and different sort of options and things
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have worked with PhotonTech.
[SPEAKER_01]: The PhotonTech is LumaTech in the rest of
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have nice fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like 50% more than the Mars Hydro
Spider Farmer fixtures of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like 60, 70% more than the
Medigrow fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes even more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at a certain point, it becomes hard to
justify anything kind of above there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's certainly companies that are
trying to market higher quality lights or
[SPEAKER_01]: other gimmicks in lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real differentiation is what we
talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many photons can you create and how
well do you do at distributing them across
[SPEAKER_01]: the crow space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Every other thing that grow light
manufacturers are trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at MJ BizCon, and you'd see all
these grow light manufacturers that have
[SPEAKER_01]: angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can adjust the angle on the LED bar
so you can tilt them back and forth like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The supplemental UV and supplemental IR
bars are including UV and IR diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just gimmicks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally just gimmicks to try to
differentiate from other people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: market or sell more lights or charge more
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of talk about tunable spectrums or
proprietary spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just mumbo jumbo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not related to anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a marketing battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pay attention to how many photons are
created, how efficient it is, and how much
[SPEAKER_01]: it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: How hard the diodes are driven is probably
the next most important factor to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many diodes there are in total and how
much power is there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have three to four diodes per
watt is a good rule to just take to
[SPEAKER_01]: evaluating any standard grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There may be reasons that I would agree
that you'd accept lower than that
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what the diodes were.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, you want three to four diodes
per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have less than that, you're going
to burn out your diodes faster regardless
[SPEAKER_01]: of what brand the diodes are, and you're
not going to run as efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: More diodes than that, you may increase
the longevity of your light, but all LEDs
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to lose efficiency through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you buy an LED and you're running it at
100% out of the box, you may need to
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement light after five years or
replace it after five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the commercial growers I work
with, we plan so that they're only running
[SPEAKER_01]: it at 85% out of the box and can ramp up
power over the next few years to extend
[SPEAKER_01]: the life of their fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, I said enough about brands in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to add anything or any
specific brands that you'd like feedback
[SPEAKER_01]: on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, I was going to ask you about
what I call the big three coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: China.
[SPEAKER_00]: You already touched on Mars Hydro,
Spider Farmer, and Viper Spectre is the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one I wanted to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're coming out with really cost
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a real relationship between Mars
Hydro and Spider Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Viper Spectre is a completely different
entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think of them slightly different,
although I like the new Viper Spectre bar
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: For home growers in particular,
I think that they are actually better at
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution because they're a little bit
bigger than the Mars and the Spider Farmer
[SPEAKER_01]: fixtures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should have brought them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think they're a good source of even
smaller lights, which is another
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down in that area, I would use a little
quantum board.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a three by three or four by
four or a larger space, I would go with an
[SPEAKER_01]: LED bar fixture, not a quantum board style
light or a cobb or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LED bars are considerably more
efficient and better at distributing the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was going to ask you about with
those three brands in particular is some
[SPEAKER_00]: of them are coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy the KS5000, for example,
from Viper Spectre, which I ran for
[SPEAKER_00]: several grows and I love it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 500 bucks to cover a four by
four or five by five grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some American brands out
there such as Chiltek and HLG,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, who for that same grow space,
they have prices that are a lot higher,
[SPEAKER_00]: upwards of $1,000 to cover that size grow
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it to be spending hundreds of
dollars more for these American brands?
[SPEAKER_01]: I suppose to a certain extent,
that might depend on what you're spending
[SPEAKER_01]: the money for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to recognize the components
and a lot of the manufacturing are still
[SPEAKER_01]: being done overseas, even for a lot of the
American brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're distributed in the United States,
but often manufactured overseas anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to justify spending twice
as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard for me to ever justify spending
even more than twice as much, which some
[SPEAKER_01]: of those lights cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chilt in particular is creating some of
the most efficient fixtures on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their Ultra Series, I believe,
is the most efficient series on the market
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be decades of running at that
efficiency before you'd recover the
[SPEAKER_01]: initial investment in terms of how much
more expensive those fixtures are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluence is another one that's in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's the big one that gets on my nerves
all the time with their marketing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Foze, F-O-H-S-E, is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell these really high cost lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They target, Foze in particular,
targets the commercial market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The marketing is basically like,
we know something about light that nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: else knows and only our light does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want this super special magic
sauce, then you need to get our specific
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of lighting companies that
have basically taken that marketing
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to try to convince growers that
there's some special quality to their
[SPEAKER_01]: light and that they're the only light that
offers it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to have the best results,
get this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they goose numbers on their grams per
square foot or their returns or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is that they're trying to prove that
point over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see how you justify spending the
costs for that technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the fixtures are very nice,
but in the end, these grow lights get
[SPEAKER_01]: mounted onto the ceiling of your grow
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want them to come on when you want
them to come on and you want them to go
[SPEAKER_01]: off when you want them to go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need them to cook you breakfast
and make your bed and do anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my take on the really expensive
models.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my pitch to the commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm working with a couple of
big commercial farms that just went in all
[SPEAKER_01]: in on Medi-Grow because what we're buying
are micro moles of light and that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheapest micro moles per light basically
that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are legitimate other reasons I think
for choosing different brands,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you want to be able to have a good
customer service experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a challenge depending on who
you're working with and if you're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with a dealer that they can actually get
responses from these organizations,
[SPEAKER_01]: from these different companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the American companies may
offer somewhat better points of contact,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're being asked to pay twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was looking at actual quotes for one of
these grows that I was working with of
[SPEAKER_01]: $160,000 for the Medi-Grow lights or
$640,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, you can pay an extra half
million dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what do we get for our extra half
million dollars?
[SPEAKER_01]: It better be damn good customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it, but cost per micro mole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those fixtures and some of those
companies that are targeting the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial space in particular are still
charging a dollar or more per micro mole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where companies that you're in,
more competitive markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do consulting in the commercial space
and I work with the growers like this on
[SPEAKER_01]: these lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the commercial scale growers are
spending other people's money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have a good sales pitch to go back
to their investors or their money man with
[SPEAKER_01]: about, well, this is the latest science
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, then they'll get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now home growers don't know enough either.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of hopefully what you and I
are on this mission to improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge base so that growers can't be
taken advantage of by companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying to sell them a bill of
goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I appreciate you shedding some light
on lighting and talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that people can look for within
lighting so they aren't getting ripped
[SPEAKER_00]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could go deeper and deeper into brands
and there's so many other things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could talk to about lighting that we can't
fit into this episode, but maybe we can
[SPEAKER_00]: come back in the future for another LED
lighting episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the listeners can find me on my
YouTube channel, DrMJCoco YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am on Instagram at DrMJCoco and run the
website cocoforcannabis.com, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the best place to sort of get in
touch with me at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm setting up a new sort of landing page,
but that's not quite ready for myself yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I love working with home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bunch of resources and articles
available for all sorts of growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: do consulting work with a lot of
commercial farms, either on sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting them set up in the first place or
solving problems or increasing efficiency
[SPEAKER_01]: and sort of achieving their goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested to talk about lights
or if you're sort of planning to purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: lights as well, check out our grow light
guide.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the recommended grow lights page,
there's a form for people to schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: appointments with me if they want to talk
about larger purchases or if they've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger room that they want to set up and
think about how to do a light layout or
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of how to effectively approach that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So love working with growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sort of straightening out grows and
helping sort of bring people to that next
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really enjoyed talking about lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope none of the brands feel
particularly called out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a whole sort of set
of brands that they need to figure out
[SPEAKER_01]: what justifies the costs that they're
asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're saying things that I think
aren't valid, that's my job is to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure that that's sort of valid out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not trying to make any enemies with
that, but I do think you need to ask
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself as a grower, what are you paying
for in this and whether or not it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to opt in at these different price
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully this has been fun and
enlightening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've really enjoyed doing both of these
shows with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for having me on and it'd be a
real pleasure to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you spitting your knowledge
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're tuning in on YouTube,
I'll definitely have a link to his YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel down in the description section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a ton of part test videos on
there and also information about growing
[SPEAKER_00]: in cocoa, which we talked about in the
previous episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd definitely like that in the
description section as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're interested in more of that
science of LED stuff that we got into a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit, my recent video on the science
of horticultural LEDs dive is pretty deep
[SPEAKER_01]: into how LEDs work and the efficiencies at
different spectrum and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: questions like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that part of this conversation was
interesting, I'd recommend following up
[SPEAKER_01]: with that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also subscribe to the channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't already every single
weekend, I'm releasing a new garden talk
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode and I'd love for you to
tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. MJ Coco, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, I appreciate you and hope you
enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
