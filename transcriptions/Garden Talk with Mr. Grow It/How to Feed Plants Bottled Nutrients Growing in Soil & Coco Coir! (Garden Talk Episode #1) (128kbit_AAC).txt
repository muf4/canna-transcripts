[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a discussion video for you this
week let's talk about feeding nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feeding nutrients is one of those things
where beginners really struggle and I
[SPEAKER_02]: think one of the things that people
misunderstand is that it can be done
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can feed nutrients to your plant in
different ways so in this video I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about the way I feed nutrients and
I also brought in Rob from CLTV.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to come in and explain the way
he feeds nutrients so you can see that
[SPEAKER_02]: there are a few different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well those are just two different ways but
there are several different ways to feed
[SPEAKER_02]: your plant nutrients and we're going to
focus on bottled nutrients on this video.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to see a video where we talk
about dry nutrients and how to feed those
[SPEAKER_02]: to plants let me know in the comments
section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright let's just get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright so what's up Rob we got Rob here
how you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good man appreciate you having me
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool cool let's talk about feeding
nutrients so there's so many different
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow in soil I grow in cocoa core I know
you've also grown in soil and cocoa core
[SPEAKER_02]: you've done DWC as well you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this video we're just going to focus on
soil and cocoa core.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start with soil and then we'll talk
about some of the techniques you do like
[SPEAKER_02]: starting from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: How you do your feeding and I'll chime in
as we go along and kind of say how I do
[SPEAKER_02]: things and then yeah we'll go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool so what do you typically use for
soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use a specific brand or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I was using soil I would use 90%
of the time I was using this Potter's Gold
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a Michigan based blend but it's
pretty comparable not it not verbatim but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty comparable to a Fox Farm Ocean
Forest so it's kind of like a pre-amended
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's nice with that you know for me
especially is I can water earlier on when
[SPEAKER_00]: I first initially put my seeds in or my
clones in I don't have to worry so much
[SPEAKER_00]: about feeding heavy at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when using soil like that's attractive
for me because it's kind of like I
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't say a totally emitted medium but
it's going to give you what you need early
[SPEAKER_00]: on and it spends something that when I
know a lot of people who will use like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox Farm Trio with that it works pretty
well but if you're using something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: amended when you're adding nutrients and
I've seen burning of the plants especially
[SPEAKER_00]: the finicky strains like my head banger is
so damn finicky it burns if you had
[SPEAKER_00]: anything extra to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it yeah I use Fox Home Ocean Forest
soil that's my main soil that I use and
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah like you said it's amended with
nutrients it already has nutrients in it
[SPEAKER_02]: so I don't need to feed any additional
nutrients on top of that for the first 20
[SPEAKER_02]: to 40 days or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also depends on how often you
transplant up right so I use a solo cup
[SPEAKER_02]: for my photo period plants and I'll
transplant up into either one gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: container or go into my final container
which is like a three gallon or a five
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon and once I'm transplanting up it's
got that first soil in there right which
[SPEAKER_02]: is amended with nutrients so I can hold
off on feeding any bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: because you know that soil has nutrients
in it that's eaten away at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I usually start feeding bottled
nutrients around day 30 is what I usually
[SPEAKER_02]: say day 30 day 40 is that kind of about
the same for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah the only thing that I do in between
then is sometimes I'll do a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses or something to help feed the
microbes in there and try to add a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit in there sometimes I'll even amend a
little bit with some great white even add
[SPEAKER_00]: you know mycorrhizae in there additionally
especially when I'm transplanting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much molasses do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: On average like usually half a teaspoon
per gallon and do it once a week okay and
[SPEAKER_00]: at that point I was just doing just
molasses and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it okay I do about one tablespoon per
gallon of water for molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing a lot more additionally at a
headbanger in particular this headbanger
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've grown it's a biker kush crossed
with sour diesel from Karma Genetics one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my favorite strains by far if you watch
lifestyle TV talked about it a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand times that strain is so damn
finicky man like it seems like I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: give low dosages everything even with
molasses which I've never seen my plants
[SPEAKER_00]: act weird with molasses but it seems like
as it's opening up having those microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: being fed more and it's helping the plant
eat more it's like it's too much for that
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant in particular not with my Wi-Fi
OG and now with my 11 roses that I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit harder you know three
teaspoons or a tablespoon obviously that
[SPEAKER_00]: no issue but it's only with that
headbanger which is my main strain I grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's a good call those different
genetics are gonna act differently as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as like nutrient uptake so I had mentioned
you know 30 days before I start feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: well some strains might might not need
that soon I could stretch out longer so
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics is gonna be a big variable there
on when to start feeding so that's a great
[SPEAKER_02]: call out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you use for nutrients base
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really digging Humboldt Secret that's
what I've been using for a while it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: as known really in the mainstream side it
seems like they're more like direct sale
[SPEAKER_00]: but I've been using their base nutrients
for a long time just recently I ran
[SPEAKER_00]: emerald emerald harvest yeah emerald
harvest but along with golden tree as well
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's like they're all-in-one additive
it's got kelp amino acids a bunch of other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit in it actually they kind of it's a
little bit of a proprietary secret sauce
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't really share everything in
it that's the only thing I'm not a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of but it's been one of the things
that you can replace almost the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: advanced nutrients line with just the one
bottle you need your base nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: that and you really are all set now the
only thing I add to it additionally again
[SPEAKER_00]: is the mycorrhizae I'm using at the moment
recharge before I was using great white I
[SPEAKER_00]: just use that for transplanting now but
with recharge it's got that molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: already in it so when I'm feeding the
plants especially in veg I'm already
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it that molasses and it's feeding
those microbes within that same mix and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing that usually every other feeding
they recommend every other feeding or once
[SPEAKER_00]: a week and aggressively seemingly is
working really well with these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you go by their feeding chart and if
you do do you do like a full dose half
[SPEAKER_02]: dose quarter dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I usually go by the feeding chart
but I start when I first start after that
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 days especially if I'm using soil I
start one-third strength what they
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend usually and then I gradually
increase over time as the plant kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: shows the signs that it's healthy and
hungry and it's doing well I'll slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: increase and if it gives me any signs of
burning I'll back off a little bit to more
[SPEAKER_00]: half strength and for me again the strains
the finicky strains I'm using that works
[SPEAKER_00]: the best some of the more like I'd say
tougher strains that I've grown I can go
[SPEAKER_00]: full blast right out of the gate and they
are totally fine and those ones though
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't seem as as terpy and unique to
me but they produce really well so this
[SPEAKER_00]: pushes and helps it yield really well but
at the same time with the the additive of
[SPEAKER_00]: the great white I feel like I would rather
put that energy into that terpy high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality strain than the producing strain
because I'm just smoking on my butt I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not the type who's doing black market
stuff anything like that so it's more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario where anything that I have when I
harvest I'm gonna keep it I'm not gonna be
[SPEAKER_00]: worrying so much about quantity I've had a
lot of times with the nutrient lines where
[SPEAKER_00]: I've changed up using green planet at one
point and I seemingly got a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more yield like I was impressed but on the
other side I seemingly lost a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: that terpene profile so I think I can't
completely vouch for humble secret being
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's gonna you know bloom huge buds
and do all this stuff but the quality
[SPEAKER_00]: difference using that even in comparison
to emerald harvest has been a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: difference hmm that's interesting yeah
I've been using so I started off using Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: Farm the trio love that only that's super
concentrated so I had to really start with
[SPEAKER_02]: like a third or a quarter dose or a third
dose yeah start and then kind of work my
[SPEAKER_02]: way up I think there's actually been
several runs where I've haven't even had
[SPEAKER_02]: to feed the plants a full dose out of Fox
Farm trio now I'm currently using blue
[SPEAKER_02]: planet nutrients which is completely
different and you know I usually start
[SPEAKER_02]: with a half dose with them and then kind
of in flowering I have been doing a full
[SPEAKER_02]: dose to you know again depending on
genetics but some some genetics need a
[SPEAKER_02]: full dose of blue planet nutrients so just
knowing that there's a difference between
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient lineups as far as what the dosage
should be I think is a key thing to take
[SPEAKER_02]: away there now do you feed every every
time or every other time or what when
[SPEAKER_00]: growing in so now when I was growing in
soil I usually would feed every time and
[SPEAKER_00]: it seemingly plants were totally cool
there I wouldn't do any waterings only
[SPEAKER_00]: time I would do straight waters later
towards the flushing cycle of course but
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently I would feed you know regular
basis no problem usually four times a week
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time I was using because now I'm
growing a cocoa but at the time I was
[SPEAKER_00]: using seven to ten gallon pots so I'd only
need to water you know or feed like three
[SPEAKER_00]: to four times a week if that depending on
the season and the plants never showed any
[SPEAKER_00]: stress I had one strain at the time this
is Holy Grail Kush that that one really
[SPEAKER_00]: would show some signs of toxicity but
every other plant was just beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: immaculate and I mean I've used everything
from Dynagro house and garden advanced
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients again Green Planet Technoflora
Emerald Harvest like I mean we've tried a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot but that's that's what helped me to
build the course club is I was like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be the guinea pig for this so I need
to know what the hell I'm talking about I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't just be saying all that try this try
this try that until I try them all and I
[SPEAKER_00]: really wanted to figure out what recipe
worked well for me in my particular
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics because I have buddies who've
been using advanced for years and their
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff looks immaculate I bring it to my
setup and the plants don't respond the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way they like they become kind of
general and generic you know as we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: the variables that come into play you
can't just say this is the one nutrient to
[SPEAKER_00]: use this is the one thing if you know what
your plant needs that's key but following
[SPEAKER_00]: a complete line it seems like the the
quality and the results definitely vary so
[SPEAKER_02]: I feed every other time most most of the
time it's every other time but I do check
[SPEAKER_02]: the PPM of the runoff to see kind of get a
picture of how much nutrients are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium so sometimes I will feed every time
if the PPM is low or sometimes I'll feed
[SPEAKER_02]: every other time or there's times where
I'm doing a water water feed water water
[SPEAKER_02]: feed so it really depends I always check
the PPM of the runoff do you check the
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff PPM at all do you have a PPM tester
or TDS tester or a EC meter?
[SPEAKER_00]: No I do now at the time when I was growing
soil so I've changed to cocoa but at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time when I was growing soil I didn't and
I was doing a lot of things kind of novice
[SPEAKER_00]: rookie style where I'm just throwing it in
and hoping for good results and a few
[SPEAKER_00]: times I did have nutrient lockouts where I
was getting either salt pocket build-ups
[SPEAKER_00]: which I feel like is less common with soil
compared to cocoa but it was more of me I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like putting too much in that medium
and the plants just not absorbing it fast
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and I wasn't using the microbes
like I should at the time so there was
[SPEAKER_00]: just the variables that came into play
that overfeeding toxicities became a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: problem so checking the PPM is ideal now I
do that now with cocoa is where like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I do more of that water feed water
feed where I break it down and I see that
[SPEAKER_00]: those results again different mediums
different treatment so to speak but oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: some people use a peat mix they'll call it
soil I mean it's soil but it's like pro
[SPEAKER_00]: mix like a peat moss you know a lot of
them I feel like are more absorbent and
[SPEAKER_00]: can if they are more inert and there's
nothing in the medium really then you can
[SPEAKER_00]: go a little bit harder but using a Fox
farm like that's where it was tough man I
[SPEAKER_00]: should have waited and I should have slow
dosed it but I was doing every feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently and that holy girl let me
know or let me know right away that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: just a no-go now what about pH do you do
adjust the pH of the nutrient solution
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to feeding the plants so usually
what I'll do is I'll put all my nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: into the water and then I'll check the
people are the pH afterwards and with
[SPEAKER_00]: everything other than Dynagro is the only
thing that I really didn't get it right
[SPEAKER_00]: down to where I needed to be it was closer
to like six seven with Dynagro every other
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient line I've used has been pretty
much pH perfect but it's for soil like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's bringing it right down to six point
four six point five it's I've never had it
[SPEAKER_00]: lower than that going higher dosage with
the the golden tree though I noticed that
[SPEAKER_00]: does bring my pH sound a little bit lower
you can use that kind of similar to a
[SPEAKER_00]: vitamin B supplement like you would with
super thrive where if you got a really
[SPEAKER_00]: stressed out plant you can hire dosa
instead of a teaspoon per gallon you can
[SPEAKER_00]: do a tablespoon per gallon for like a
one-time feeding and in that case it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only time the pH dropped way lower
otherwise I usually don't have to dial in
[SPEAKER_02]: that pH much when I'm using soil for me
when I adjust the nutrient mix normally I
[SPEAKER_02]: will like we'll do plant nutrients I'll
have to adjust up I forget about Fox farm
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'd adjust up with Fox farm but
I'll adjust the pH up and like roughly
[SPEAKER_02]: around six point five is where I like to
feed in at and then I'll also pH the
[SPEAKER_02]: runoff as well see what the pH of the
runoff is because yeah that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: different do you do that as well or yeah
with again with cocoa I do with soil I was
[SPEAKER_00]: this was it's been probably seven eight
years since I've grown in soil got a while
[SPEAKER_00]: but I definitely have acquaintances and
different grommies in the club who are
[SPEAKER_00]: using soil and and with that process you
know I feel like a lot of people overlook
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact that the medium is more alive
being that it's soil it's gonna be what
[SPEAKER_00]: you do how you treat it early on is kind
of how it needs to continuously go and
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when somebody's doing something
like adding a dry amendment into it and
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're changing the game instead of
using the liquid mineral based nutrients I
[SPEAKER_00]: never really went that route just because
I kind of like the easy do it get it go
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of Kool-Aid style but at the same
time like having your medium kind of work
[SPEAKER_00]: for you that's where again using a great
white or recharge or something to
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculate that root system and really get
those roots working for you is gonna help
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever nutrients you use to be absorbed
better and taken in better so that way
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just like throwing in nutrients
into your medium and hoping it does better
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be able to absorb it more one
other thing to mention for me is when I
[SPEAKER_02]: mix up my nutrients what I'll do is I'll
mix up the nutrients adjust the pH and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I'll put in microbes after the fact
because I guess the pH up and down will
[SPEAKER_02]: kill off microbes it's not gonna kill off
all of them but it will kill off some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them so it is advised to add in the
microbes after pH adjusting I didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: know that so I appreciate the tip there
man honestly didn't even know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it makes sense with the acidity
trying to add that in and changing it up
[SPEAKER_00]: it totally doesn't make sense I just I've
been really blessed to not have to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pH level too much I still dial it
in and check it but only when I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: like if I'm watering again with now with
the cocoa mix when I'm watering with that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do this plain water or water with
calmeg and I'll need to dial in that pH so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where that changes a little bit got
it okay now okay so you've what watering
[SPEAKER_02]: the plants you water all the way through
what do you do with the runoff usually
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just let it sit there for about maybe
an hour and then I'll use a shop vac and
[SPEAKER_00]: suck it all up and empty that shop vac out
I don't let it sit in there too long but
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when I'm in flower like I don't
mind the humidity level just getting up a
[SPEAKER_00]: pinch more because I'm usually struggling
with the humidity in there here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan I'm having to like kick the
humidifier on all the time like it's on
[SPEAKER_00]: 24-7 because it's fluctuating from like 30
percent to 60 percent I try to keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: around 40 50 percent so sometimes leaving
those saucers with a little bit of water
[SPEAKER_00]: will help me get that you know room
humidity right where I need it to be got
[SPEAKER_02]: it for me I sometimes I'll let it sit in
there and just let it absorb up other
[SPEAKER_02]: times I'll go ahead and I'll shop back it
up you know I've noticed that I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's you know it equals more salt
buildup if I don't suck up that if I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: suck up those that runoff I feel like this
salt buildup and I have more problems
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe it's just in my head but it just
kind of seems that way so it makes sense
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to get in the habit of sucking up
that runoff more often and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: pushing things through and kind of you
know hopefully that that kind of clears up
[SPEAKER_02]: any problems that I have but it might just
be in my head it makes sense it's not like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an ebb and flow system you know it's
if it's just stagnant water that's sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there that ran potentially pulled more
salts more minerals out of your medium to
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom and it's just sitting there and
it's stagnant I could see that being an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue and that's where usually I don't
leave it too long and it's depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the season like at the most an hour and it
sometimes I have seen again with different
[SPEAKER_00]: mediums it does suck back up pretty
quickly it'll go through there too fast
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's too dry and then it just kind of
absorbs back up like a sponge I see it a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit less with their nervous oil in
comparison to using cocoa but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I've never seen a major
issue leaving it that long it's only I
[SPEAKER_00]: think extended a period of time and that's
happened before when I think I'm good to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and I leave the grow and I come back
the next morning and I'm like whoa look at
[SPEAKER_00]: all this water still here I thought it was
good but it slowly drained out yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was trying to rush it in and out of
the grow I want to go back to nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: real quick one thing we didn't talk about
is additive so you know base nutrients Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: arm trio basically has three bottles for
example I've found that ever since I
[SPEAKER_02]: switched to LED I've had calcium and
magnesium issues and I've had to
[SPEAKER_02]: supplement with Cal Mag so I grew with HID
for six years and then I've been going to
[SPEAKER_02]: LED for about four years four or five
years now and so I now I supplement with
[SPEAKER_02]: Cal Mag do you supplement with Cal Mag or
any do you put any other out additives in
[SPEAKER_00]: there silica you know so on and so forth
yeah I add right now I'm using that great
[SPEAKER_00]: white and I'm using Cal Mag those are my
two additives that I use and then I also
[SPEAKER_00]: have the all-in-one additive which is
golden tree so like basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: all-in-one additive is like all of your
additional micro or macronutrients not
[SPEAKER_00]: macro all your additional micronutrients
it's got your amino acids kelp carbs and
[SPEAKER_00]: some minerals in there too so it's nice
you can kind of work that in conjunction
[SPEAKER_00]: with your base nutrients and then with
again if you're using something like cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm adding Cal Mag on a regular basis I
haven't had the pleasure to do soil I will
[SPEAKER_00]: be soon actually soil underneath the LED
so I haven't ran into that but I always am
[SPEAKER_00]: adding some Cal Mag in because of it being
cocoa for me do you feed Cal Mag every
[SPEAKER_02]: time even when even on your watering days
or do you only still feed Cal Mag in on
[SPEAKER_00]: your feeding days I do it more on my
watering days actually so like I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower doses recommended so 2.5
milliliters per gallon with when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding and then when I'm doing just by
itself plain water I'll do Cal Mag at a
[SPEAKER_02]: full strength of like five milliliters per
gallon I kind of varies for me I'll go
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead and add it in with my normal
nutrients at five to ten milliliters per
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon I think my blue planet nutrients
Cal Mag goes up to ten milliliters per
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon maybe some more water down I don't
know but on my watering days sometimes I
[SPEAKER_02]: will add in just Cal Mag but most of the
time I don't but that's a question I have
[SPEAKER_02]: for the people that are watching this do
you feed Cal Mag every time let me know in
[SPEAKER_02]: the comment section below what you do for
Cal Mag feeding okay next one thing I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to touch on real quick it didn't really
revolve with feeding nutrients but it
[SPEAKER_02]: relates to it which is the flushing aspect
you flush it all during your grow like
[SPEAKER_02]: mid-grow like to flush out any salts or
anything if I'm having some issues I do I
[SPEAKER_00]: usually don't at one point I was doing
that transitioning into flour and then
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stopped doing that and I've noticed
no difference what I've done though is
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just done lower dosages of my
flowering nutrients switching into flour
[SPEAKER_00]: but I recently did a little test basically
and it worked pretty well is I started
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding my flowering nutrients a week
before going into flower so in veg I was
[SPEAKER_00]: started fleet feeding the flowering
nutrients and I've got zero stretch like I
[SPEAKER_00]: measured it there was no stretch not a
centimeter none but my headbanger was
[SPEAKER_00]: yellow as hell got lime green and stressed
out like really not happy the eleven roses
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm growing totally fine totally
great bushy and nice one of my plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: was not happy so it was an experiment that
I saw was good for one strain and it helps
[SPEAKER_00]: there but I think maybe if I would have
flushed and then done that it made a
[SPEAKER_00]: result a little bit better because that
strain is very finicky that headbanger is
[SPEAKER_00]: just one that like you got to treat it
really unique yeah for me I I try to avoid
[SPEAKER_02]: flushing mid-grow as much as possible I've
tried the flushing between veg and flour
[SPEAKER_02]: before one time I worked out great and
then the other two times the next two
[SPEAKER_02]: times unfortunately I had like yellowing
like two weeks into flowering and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh great so worst time they have
problems is you know being a flower mid
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering so I try to avoid flushing as
much as possible but sometimes you need to
[SPEAKER_02]: like I'm growing some plants right now
which I need you to admit flush on which
[SPEAKER_02]: so unfortunately but sometimes you got to
do what you got to do yeah now flushing at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the cycle do you flush before
you harvest yeah so what I usually do is I
[SPEAKER_00]: feed my plant for about six to seven weeks
depending on the strain I'm growing if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a eight to nine week or usually the
furthest I go is a nine week strain once
[SPEAKER_00]: in a while if I land a ten week or I'll
let her go but usually two weeks prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest I just stopped feeding nutrients
completely and I'm just watering pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy enough where there's a good amount
of runoff but not like a crazy amount like
[SPEAKER_00]: a heavy flush you'd see a lot of people
doing so you know what I've read and what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've understood over times of growing and
reading all the different grow Bibles is
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plants gonna still have about 14
days left of nutrients in the medium so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna have time to eat that up and
I'd rather instead of it having like an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra two weeks of time to eat it up after
the fact I rather give it that full two
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks to just eat up what it has kind of
fade out get the color that I like
[SPEAKER_00]: especially I love that kind of like
purplish yellow faded look to the leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's finishing and that's where like
I don't see that unless I flush two weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: prior and again my flush is a little
different than most people I just start
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding plain water all the way through pH
balanced water of course but and that's it
[SPEAKER_00]: for two weeks and usually my plants fade
out like I want and white ash good to go
[SPEAKER_02]: for me usually about two weeks out when
the trichomes are about right I will
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on the color of the plants right
if it's like dark green leaves I'll guide
[SPEAKER_02]: not do a full flush where I'd basically
flush out double the amount of water in
[SPEAKER_02]: gallons so if I'm doing like a three
gallon grow pot I'll put six gallons of
[SPEAKER_02]: water through the medium and that'll help
get some of those nutrients out of there
[SPEAKER_02]: and help those leaves lighten up get those
chlorophyll break down so on and so forth
[SPEAKER_02]: and then other times there were already be
starting to be a little natural fade a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple weeks prior so now just feed plain
water for the remainder of the grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it'll you know continue to fade and
then it'll be ready to harvest yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's so genetic specific I think
it's so like there's never just a rule of
[SPEAKER_00]: thumb there's like five different rules
because when it comes to certain strains
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know I've had this do-si-do that
was looking like it was done in seven
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks and I was feeding full strength
nutrients I was like what's going on like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just telling me hey I'm about done so
then I just slowly started flushing and
[SPEAKER_00]: did great I had a Wi-Fi OG that was like
vibrant bright green at week eight and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: like what that's going on so that's where
I did a heavy flush and that is exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the result you know is in getting more
yellowing more the chlorophyll breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to see that plant decaying and
dying like it should like you would see
[SPEAKER_02]: outside normally and the natural
environment all right let's move on to
[SPEAKER_00]: coco core that's my specialty now that's
what I'm into man sweet all right so
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty much the same same flow that we had
before so you know what type of cocoa do
[SPEAKER_00]: you use so I'm a big fan of Royal Gold and
I really love their whole line right now
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using tupper it's just cocoa perlite
and some h4s minerals and it's pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing in it you know it's pretty much an
inert medium the main thing for me is I
[SPEAKER_00]: was getting you know big bricks of the pro
mix for a while and I started bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: home root aphids and that was a really
real headache for me because I'm like what
[SPEAKER_00]: am I doing that is creating these aphids
man and then I had another buddy at the
[SPEAKER_00]: grocer's like yeah dude I got root aphids
and another buddy had it and I'm like I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been to your grow you haven't been
to my grow we're all using the same medium
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of all just came together and
we're like yeah man they're not storing
[SPEAKER_00]: this properly like something's going on
here I don't know what like not working so
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up trying cocoa I'm like you know
what I'm gonna see how it works and for
[SPEAKER_00]: the longest time I was getting just cheap
bricks from Amazon and I wasn't liking
[SPEAKER_00]: what I was getting like just wasn't wasn't
the results that I heard people getting
[SPEAKER_00]: until we linked up with Royal Gold and
they we met them at the cups from years
[SPEAKER_00]: back and it was really insightful on how
how cocoa is sourced and how you get it in
[SPEAKER_00]: general and like even the sustainability
compared to peat moss and that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: what helped me as I'm trying to even
transition from mineral based nutrients to
[SPEAKER_00]: organic nutrients for the sustainability
purposes you know and that was a really
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive thing and then for the watering
too like you know I sometimes do need a
[SPEAKER_00]: water more often because I'm let's say I'm
gonna be leaving the next day so I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: do a heavy water in the morning and a
light water at night and then I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to worry about it for a day or two at all
and just little variables for me that I
[SPEAKER_00]: was really attracted to and I really liked
EWC at one point and I like the results I
[SPEAKER_00]: got but some of the things from cocoa that
are not from soil that I preferred kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: were mixed in hybridized with using the
soilless media so that's why I switched
[SPEAKER_00]: over and then Tupper has been great for me
man other than I can't ever get it like at
[SPEAKER_00]: the crow store it's always out people buy
the shit out of it around here got it yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: I I've been using those cheap bricks from
Amazon and rinse them out and buffer them
[SPEAKER_02]: and still I mean I've had issues with them
yeah really only grown a cocoa a handful
[SPEAKER_02]: of times so I don't have too much
experience with cocoa I prefer soil but I
[SPEAKER_02]: do have experience growing a cocoa and
yeah those those bricks are filled with
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium mostly and yeah it just they've
been like scraped up off of beaches and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and like just source very poorly you
know yeah yeah but when so when you start
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding nutrients and cocoa so I usually
start after like a week I'll let the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in especially if I'm doing a clone like I
usually use aeropondite cloners so my
[SPEAKER_00]: roots are just straight up roots going
right into the media and I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: like shock them directly right away so
I'll just feed the first week on feed I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just water plain pH balanced water and
then after that is when I'll start feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: and I start with third strength nutrients
and work my way up week by week where and
[SPEAKER_00]: then I'm to full strength if the plant
needs it if it doesn't then I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go full strength because I do see some
strains they're vibrant green and good at
[SPEAKER_00]: like three-quarter strength so I'm like
all right keep it at that like there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that I guess I could add more
potential
[SPEAKER_02]: and you use the same type of nutrients
that you use for soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: yep that again the difference here is
using Cal Mag more frequently because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it's gonna need it totally inert so
I've been using that consistently now for
[SPEAKER_00]: like seven years maybe eight years it's
been a while now I can't remember I always
[SPEAKER_00]: say like been growing for ten plus years
but longer than that at this point 2020 so
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the difference for me I don't
notice a massive yield difference I see
[SPEAKER_00]: people who argue about the the quality
difference or the the turp difference but
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the control of being able to fix a
sick plant where I can maybe add more
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients quicker or I can feed it more
consistently and the I do how I do in soil
[SPEAKER_02]: now what about pH pH is a pretty pretty
significant topic when it comes to cocoa
[SPEAKER_02]: core what do you do for pH do you pH your
nutrient solution prior to putting it in?
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah so I'll pH my nutrient solution you
know after I add all my mix to it now I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be adding the microbes after the fact
appreciate that tip there should have been
[SPEAKER_00]: on that already but um so then I'll do my
pH after the fact and I 99.9% of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do it because the lowest that it
goes with my mix is to 6.4 and so when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in veg I'll do it anywhere from 5.5 to 5.8
and the high end 6 usually I try to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: it within that 5.5 to 5.8 range and then
once I'm like midway through flower I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: change that up closer to 6.2 from what
I've read it can help the phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium uptake a little bit more and
that's gonna be you know again with cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: it reacts a little bit differently but I
see I see that kind of swelling it up or
[SPEAKER_00]: doing what I can to try to help those buds
swell up more while still getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of feeding heavy and not
overdoing it is by changing that pH is the
[SPEAKER_00]: only difference I've noticed for micro is
upping it to around 6.2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you pH the runoff as well or only the
nutrient solution going in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll test the pH of the runoff so I don't
always do it like I'll do it usually once
[SPEAKER_00]: a week and I'll check the PPM as well
because that's been like I like straight
[SPEAKER_00]: up PTSD over having new lockouts and just
salt buildups little pockets in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been one of those things where I've
thought it was a million different issues
[SPEAKER_00]: and it turns out that was the one problem
and then I look back I'm like oh common
[SPEAKER_00]: sense I was feeding way too heavy or you
know in one spot I was just pouring it all
[SPEAKER_00]: into a single spot and let it flow through
instead of evenly dispersing the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's just a lot of different
variables when it comes I feel like to
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa of it being more totally controlled
by you in comparison to the soil kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: working with it you got to kind of really
dial in your pH you got to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: you know some people grow straight cocoa
I've done that before and I feel like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: suffocating my roots other people swear by
it I always make sure I have some perlite
[SPEAKER_00]: in there I feel like just aeration to make
sure that there's some air to the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: but then in my cocoa I always again I'll
add that micro I say whether I'm using
[SPEAKER_00]: great way I usually use great way for
transplanting that's my go-to and then
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll water with recharge for me I pH 5.8
every time and then that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had best results in is just pH pH
nutrient solution 5.8 every time going in
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried to go up to 6.0 6.2 I've gone
up to before but I've had issues
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency issues and so 5.8 has just been
kind of the magic thing for me now
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring the pH of the runoff you know at
first when I first start using it it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of equals to what I put in you know 5.8
going going in 5.8 going out however over
[SPEAKER_02]: time I found that it kind of significantly
drifts upwards usually so like I'll put
[SPEAKER_02]: 5.8 in and then all of a sudden I'll see
like high sixes or even sevens and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like what the heck is going on here and so
I've done the research and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of agree that like with cocoa it'll
drift up so some people a lot of people I
[SPEAKER_02]: guess just ignore the runoff pH and that's
why I tell people grown in cocoa is to
[SPEAKER_02]: just ignore that runoff pH and just only
worry about the pH going in and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just me that's what I've had best
luck at so actually I would love to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: to the viewers watching this do you pH
adjust your nutrients going in to cocoa
[SPEAKER_02]: and also do you check the runoff pH when
growing in cocoa I'd love to know your
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts in the comment section below
flushing any difference with flushing for
[SPEAKER_00]: cocoa compared to soil same thing really
it's the same for me it definitely be the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing I've seen people using you know
additives like a to try to remove the
[SPEAKER_00]: minerals I think there's like design or
something by dining grow people will use
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things like that I'm not into that
I just do straight straight pH balanced
[SPEAKER_02]: water okay yeah pretty much same with me I
don't I rarely flush only really flush
[SPEAKER_02]: when I have problems and then I'll do that
end of the grill flush same
[SPEAKER_02]: decision-making as when I'm growing in
soil and then and then runoff what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: do with the runoff for cocoa so that to
all same exact scenario usually I'll suck
[SPEAKER_00]: that off after about sucked it off like
that out after an hour and it's like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I've seen again people let there sit
longer I've seen the drain to waste
[SPEAKER_00]: growers who have like tubs of water damn
near that it's sitting into but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: don't like that stagnant water that's
built up with minerals I'm too paranoid
[SPEAKER_00]: about having an issue again PTSD from
having the the lockouts man like I've had
[SPEAKER_00]: times where I thought it was this that
this that and it's the one issue me just
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoing it or not paying attention that
I'm the PPM is way too high in the meat
[SPEAKER_00]: like the runoff so that that's more what I
check more times in the pH even for the
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff is that PPM to see him like is am I
having way more coming out than what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in because that's a problem like
that I've done way too much in the medium
[SPEAKER_00]: and I noticed that a lot less with cocoa
than when I dealt with the soil it's rare
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have an issue like that with cocoa
and those little user-friendly things that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you controlling it is is you know ideal
but if you're not controlling it cocoa can
[SPEAKER_00]: be a major headache for those little
factors we got a dial in that pH even some
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient lines that you know it's advanced
they have the cocoa version or like cocos
[SPEAKER_00]: with house and garden even too a lot of
that I feel like is pH related but also
[SPEAKER_00]: based on that you're gonna need more
calcium a lot of times in your mix so what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna have formulated is gonna be
a little different so sometimes getting
[SPEAKER_00]: that cocoa specific nutrient could be
easier to use than trying to you know mess
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pH or modify things to work for
cocoa cool I think we covered just about
[SPEAKER_02]: everything anything that you can think of
as far as like feeding tips or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that you think we missed I think that I
mean have you done any dry amendments for
[SPEAKER_02]: either yeah I think dry amendments is a
whole different video yeah yeah this is
[SPEAKER_02]: more just like bottle nutrient feeding
either yeah pretty much maybe next time
[SPEAKER_00]: around we can we can do a video yeah yeah
I think the only thing to add would be you
[SPEAKER_00]: know again big fan of great white or
recharge something like that to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that your plants absorbing those nutrients
properly there's other options my coast
[SPEAKER_00]: and ASOS and things like that I guess it's
really totally up to the viewer but when
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes to making sure what you're
putting into that plant is being absorbed
[SPEAKER_00]: properly you definitely want that root
system to be working that's key cool well
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob thank you so much for coming on to my
channel and talking about feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients definitely things a lot of good
information especially for the new growers
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of new grows hit me up with a
lot of questions asking about feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and I think one of the things
that people confused on they think it
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be done the same way every time
there's only one way to do it they think
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean there's so many different ways
to do it so you know experiment try what
[SPEAKER_02]: you know experiment would do things and
see what's best for you is kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: advice I I give to new growers so any
final words for for this if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: check out some more advanced growing stuff
check out our last live stream and we got
[SPEAKER_00]: into a lot of Q&A that was stuff that we
normally don't touch on because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more advanced for some people
you know yep I will leave a link to Rob's
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube channel in the description section
below go down there click on his channel
[SPEAKER_02]: subscribe and let him know that mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: growth sent you appreciate it brother
