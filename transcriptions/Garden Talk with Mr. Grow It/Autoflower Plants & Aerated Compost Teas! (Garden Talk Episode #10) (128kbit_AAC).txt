[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing for your
root system to have to make your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: grow vigorously is you need oxygen and you
need microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you want to form an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a Christmas tree, you have,
you know, the lower bud sites that could
[SPEAKER_01]: be getting the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not getting the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being covered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to become airy like
popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as nutrients, I do start off with
the recharge, you know, by real growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh, my God, if anyone's been following
the, you know, the Skittles autoflower,
[SPEAKER_01]: she like exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got a trunk almost like my arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you micromanage, you are going to
overwater because you feel like you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to do something and that's where people
screw up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and this is Garden
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk, episode 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, I talk with a grower who
goes by the name 420Scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is a fellow YouTuber that has almost
12,000 subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: He has been gardening for over seven years
and he specializes in growing autoflower
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this episode, we talk about autoflower
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to dig deep and find out exactly
what he does when he's growing
[SPEAKER_02]: autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also talk a little bit about aerated
compost teas because he does have
[SPEAKER_02]: experience with those as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Click that thumbs up button if you haven't
already and subscribe to the channel if
[SPEAKER_02]: you haven't done that already as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I release these Garden Talk videos once a
week, every Saturday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course, after the episode,
drop a comment down in the comment section
[SPEAKER_02]: below.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to know what you do when you grow
autoflower plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, what do you do for aerated teas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Drop that down below.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you enjoyed this episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get right into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, 420Scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be on, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get right into things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those that don't know who you are,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself and how you got into growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 420Scene, as a lot of you guys know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still remember I was in electrical
school, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And before class, I was just looking up
the different lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how to grow and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first, when I first started growing,
there was so much information out there
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was just so crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these different forums out
there and all the different resources,
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so much opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's good information?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's bad information?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started out, I thought it was
going to be really, really tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember before I actually got into
growing, I actually started taking notes
[SPEAKER_01]: about everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light cycles and NPK ratios and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing about horticulture that I
learned is it's like you got to practice
[SPEAKER_01]: to get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get all the information you get,
but you can read every forum, everything
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't practice, if you don't
practice your craft, you're never going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I try to tell everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so many people that just read books,
read forums, and they have knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll be on the forums replying,
giving answers, yet they haven't grown the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad that it's like that for some
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, doing your research is one
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Executing and getting the experience is
certainly another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you're at the point now where you
have a YouTube channel, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you launch the YouTube channel
and what type of videos do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're at, what, a little
over, was it 12,000 or 15,000 subscribers
[SPEAKER_02]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually just grazed past 11,000
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually started out as Cush Life,
a lot of like long time OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the channel we'll know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started out with Cush Life.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, my channel is a little bit different
from a lot of the other horticulture
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTubers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost have a really chill Xcode A
kind of vibe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do grow videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do stoner life stories, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do news within the horticulture
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a lot of people like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a variety of a little bit of
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do those sit down videos where you sit
down, press record button on the camera
[SPEAKER_02]: and just fire away talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit of an inspiration for me,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do more of those types of videos
and the way you execute them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have grow vlog series and pretty
much, you know, I talk about each day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like time lapses and I try to make
it like really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And fun for everybody, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's definitely a lot of good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like my tips from my grow vlogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because YouTube doesn't like us very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hate us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hate us.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those watching and not familiar with
420 Scenes channel, I'll have that linked
[SPEAKER_02]: down in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's get into the topics
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we're going to talk about auto
flowers and we'll also talk about compost
[SPEAKER_02]: teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off by talking about auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What medium do you usually grow auto
flowers in?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was actually experimenting
with a lot of different stuff and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I'm a huge Fox farm guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows Fox farm Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What I like to do is because I do
transplant the auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are weird about
that, but what I do is I start them off in
[SPEAKER_01]: happy frog because it's a it's pretty
light soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like Fox farms light warrior,
you know, and when I do transplant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have the you know, the bottom
like the bottom half portion of strawberry
[SPEAKER_01]: fields, you know, with some perlite
because strawberry fields does not really
[SPEAKER_01]: have the best drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's I mean, it's really good for
flowering and that like the top layer of
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil I have happy frog and sometimes
I'll mix in ocean forest with happy frog,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because ocean forest has,
you know, like like bat guano,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, pretty important for
the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like my logic behind that is,
okay, you know, when I transplant,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to have to go through the
veg stage and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're not going to be in the veg
stage for that long because they are auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, by the time they start
flowering, the roots already hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottom half, which will be the strawberry
field.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of my thinking behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so do you start in like a solo cup and
then what container size do you transplant
[SPEAKER_02]: into?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go from a solo cup to like a seven or a
10 gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then are you using plastic pots,
fabric pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think they're great for
aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about your plant
getting root bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, you know, just kind of start
spinning around, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You were cutting out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you say smart pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, smart pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what do you use for nutrients
when you're feeding auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as nutrients, I do start off with
the recharge, you know, by real growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oh my God, if anyone's been following
the, you know, the Skittles auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: she like exploded, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like she's got, she's got a trunk almost
like my arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start off with a recharge like during
the veg stage and, and then I give it some
[SPEAKER_01]: composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once in a while I'll throw in some,
some of ILGM flowering, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bud booster nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's got a zero 27,
27 NPK root.
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's excellent for flower,
you know, got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you use Fox farm trio as well or,
or no, I actually used to use the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 dozen and, and the trio no more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found that it didn't really,
didn't really help me out too much,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I do like the Beastie blooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the NPK ratio was like zero 56
zero or something like that straight up
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to use Beastie blooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like three, four and five a flower,
I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that just helps out tremendously
because, you know, particularly using Fox
[SPEAKER_02]: farm trio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to get a lot of phosphorus
deficiency mid flowering and using that PK
[SPEAKER_02]: booster, the Beastie blooms helps out so
much, so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if anybody's using the Fox farm trio
out there and are facing phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: deficiency in flowering, you might want to
try Beastie blooms cause that's all my
[SPEAKER_02]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you use any, uh, sugars or microbial
inoculants?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you said to use recharge,
which has microbes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you use anything else beyond that for
microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say I use the, um, you know,
the organic blackstrap unsulfured
[SPEAKER_01]: molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I use plantation, plantation or
grandma's those are the two that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think are pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I also use honey during,
during the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people have been asking me
on my channel, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you have any kind of pest issues,
you know, because, you know, honey,
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet, you know, could that, could that
draw like have issues with bugs and sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of, you know, that sort of thing and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I like using honey is
because it is an excellent root stimulant
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know, um, you know, the,
the growth and development of your roots
[SPEAKER_01]: are like super important in the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like the roots is something
that people don't really like,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially a lot of newer growers out
there, you know, they just, they think
[SPEAKER_01]: what's important are the leaves and what
they see, but like how they feed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that, you know, the roots,
the root system, that's the most important
[SPEAKER_01]: thing right there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when do you usually apply honey or
molasses and what dosage do you usually do
[SPEAKER_01]: the honey?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do one tablespoon per gallon and the
molasses I do about two tablespoons per
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the honey I use like maybe a week
three to week five, you know, or until,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, whenever they start flowering it
in and then molasses, um, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: two tablespoons per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the flowering stage up until
maybe week six after that, I kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: cut it off and I apply those every like,
every like two weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when you say week six, are you talking
about veg or flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I cut it off?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So molasses, you're only doing in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I will, I will give it,
um, the first dose of molasses,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, um, when I start seeing like
preflowers, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in regards to feeding auto flowers and
comparing them with photo periods,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people do treat auto flowers
differently than photo periods when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you treat auto flowers differently when
it comes to feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I treat it pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless I want to veg longer than the only
difference is, you know, I'm just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to, um, I'm just going to keep giving,
you know, giving it like honey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much it,
you know, but I pretty much keep it the
[SPEAKER_01]: same as far as the feeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that you also do training on
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, that skittles that you're
growing right now, you have done some
[SPEAKER_02]: training to it, tons of tops throughout
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so what do you, so I assume you'd like
to maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you typically do for training auto
flowers in order to maximize yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, topping, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I don't top is because with
auto flowers, you know, you don't have any
[SPEAKER_01]: control, which means they, you know,
they could start flowering week three,
[SPEAKER_01]: they could start flowering, you know,
they could start flowering week five or
[SPEAKER_01]: six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if you top too early,
you're screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you top too late, that's not good
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little sketchy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So topping is out.
[SPEAKER_01]: LST is king as far as auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: LST is absolutely king.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have 62 tops on that Skittles auto
flower, dude, it doesn't even matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't even fit in the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's, it's coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes the closet and the light look,
you know, it makes the closet look really
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, that, that one reminds me
of a Carmelicious I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was similar to, to what you,
what I saw in your Skittles picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it just bursting out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually ended up getting a half
pound off of an auto flower plant before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pretty proud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people might be watching this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've gotten more than that, but I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the highest yield you've gotten off
of an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And do you think that Skittles is going to
be big enough to get over half pound or
[SPEAKER_02]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I got 10 O's on the master Kush and
that was an auto flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 O, you know, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you, it's all about training
and I love low stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously you're not stressing
your plan out at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the growth is not stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growth is constantly going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and, um, see, you want to form
an even canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a Christmas tree, you have,
you know, the lower bud sites that could
[SPEAKER_01]: be getting the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not getting the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being covered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to become airy like
popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that flat top canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Except my Skittles looks more like a,
look like a wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want an even distribution of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what low stress training is to me
and even distribution of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you get all those colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always try to, I always try to challenge
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: The most I had was actually 82 tops on an
auto, which is like ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a lot for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, I don't think as many people
really think about the importance of the
[SPEAKER_02]: veg stage when it comes to auto flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, like we touched upon before,
it's on a living and lifespan,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In my experience growing up, auto flowers,
I've had plants with no stunt and growth
[SPEAKER_02]: for the first 30, 40 days and they just
became huge versus, you know, you're
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly over water and over an auto
flower and veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you see a stunt and growth or if you
top it or even sometimes transplanting,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's a controversial topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've tried doing that before and I've
still seen that stunt and growth,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, low stress training is low
stress.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's not really going to
stunt the growth, uh, if any at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really feel like there's a lot of
people that aren't aware of keeping the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant healthy and trying to get as big as
possible for those first 30, 40 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause after that it's going into
flowering, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the problem a lot of people have
is everybody tries to micromanage their
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, every day, Oh, you know,
Oh, what's wrong with this leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with this leaf?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, bro, chill out, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, dude, like when you
micromanage, you are going to overwater
[SPEAKER_01]: because you feel like you need to do
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where people screw up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you something.
[SPEAKER_01]: This skittles auto flower in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I water twice the entire veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why I go by the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant tells you what it needs,
you know, like, like you don't know
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant knows everything, you know,
you feed it accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You water accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty much what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that particular plant, you started
in a solo cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: What day do you remember what day you
transplanted into that larger container?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a seven gallon or a 10 gallon?
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is a seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, maybe 10 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rule of thumb that I go by once the
leaves start sticking out of, out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: perimeter of the cup, you have maybe like
an extra couple of days before,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you might, you know,
you don't want to get root bound.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you, you know, that's when
I transplant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you sprinkle any mycorrhizal fungi on
the roots during transplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use mycos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using that since the get-go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I started using mycos because
Cali Green, he's the guy that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I first started watching,
you know, all these grow videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he's mycos ever since I was like,
I'm just going to keep using mycos all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I spread that around the root
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the things that's
just so beneficial that some gardeners
[SPEAKER_02]: don't use is mycorrhizal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it definitely helps with the
transplant shock, reducing the chances of
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it feels like every time I use
that there's like no slow growth at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one thing that should
be in everybody's garden is using
[SPEAKER_02]: mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people, here's the thing
though, like when you first start growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and you look at different resources,
everybody's shoving nutrients down your
[SPEAKER_01]: throat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Fox Farms the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, this brand's the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: This brand's the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody really talks about like,
you know, the microbes in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing for your
root system to have to make your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: grow vigorously is you need oxygen and you
need microbes, you know, which equals an
[SPEAKER_01]: aerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me recap real quick before we move
on to the next topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, for auto flowers in
particular, you start off in a solo cup
[SPEAKER_02]: around day 10 or so you'll transplant into
a seven gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that seven gallon is a mixture usually
of Fox Farm, happy frog and ocean forest
[SPEAKER_02]: is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there you're doing a top
dressing with ILGM bloom nutrients,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are what dry organic nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I only do that once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what points do you feed again?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do like a top dressing at a certain
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually top dress with down the earth
fish bone meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fish bone meal I put around maybe week
three or four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what some people don't know is that
fish bone meal week, sorry, week three or
[SPEAKER_02]: four of flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've gone 30 days and then 21 days
later, roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So around day 50 ish is when you're doing
that day 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are you talking about from sprout?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: From sprout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's about right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I top dress with fish bone meal from down
the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a lot of people don't understand
is it's good to start that a little,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a week earlier, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of like week five, because it
takes a little while for that fish bone
[SPEAKER_01]: meal to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to become accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's one thing I try to,
I try to tell people about that fish bone
[SPEAKER_01]: meal is great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's phosphorus right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think, I think the NPK was
like, I think like one, 12, zero or
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just that for a top dressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you do molasses every week or so,
every week or two throughout flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll up to week six of flower
and then recharge every week throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, just veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just veg for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during flower I put in my own compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that around the same time, the week
three or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, maybe week two, maybe week three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think week two is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week two of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I start putting in the compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I like to use with the compost
tea for anyone that's interested,
[SPEAKER_01]: I like using alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like using kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, if you want phosphorus,
seabird guano is what you need,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and I use earthworm castings as
well from, you know, wiggly worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, of course I also use,
I use the organic blackstrap molasses and
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that all together, you know,
and I brew that for about 30 hours after I
[SPEAKER_01]: dechlor water for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I add that into the flower as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your flower recipe.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good transition, by the way,
to get into compost tea, which is our next
[SPEAKER_02]: avenue here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's your flower recipe for compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do you have a separate recipe for
veg compost teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually, veg, I just use recharge
because it's been, I mean, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for, I'm sorry, for your ratios,
what ratios do you use for those nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: in the compost tea or the compost?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use two to four tablespoons of the
blackstrap molasses, alfalfa meal and kelp
[SPEAKER_01]: meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, you know, I do one tablespoon of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do one cup of seabird guano and one cup
of worm castings, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that for a five gallon bucket?
[SPEAKER_01]: Five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fill it with three gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, because if I, if I have a
five gallon and a five gallon,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's going to be a lot of
spillage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty good with a three, because I'm
using a seven gallon pot, three gallons,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then how long do you let it brew for?
[SPEAKER_01]: About 28, 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do you pH adjust it at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: After everything is done, I pH adjust it
because my water is like 7.8, 8.0.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it between 6.0 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's where I'm getting the
real optimal results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do you also dilute?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people will dilute the tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they take the tea, they'll add it in
with additional water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you do any type of diluting at all,
or do you just feed it straight to the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just pour it right in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what equipment do you use to brew
the teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the Unic Life UL 40 air pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 30, 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, I attach a hose from,
from the Unic Life to the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to air stones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I get it bubbling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't really talk about
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it really makes a
difference, but I think it might.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like to oxygenate the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, when I'm not, when I'm not
having the tea, like while it's dechlorine
[SPEAKER_01]: for 24 hours, I just throw the air stones
in there and I bubble it for that 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours, you know, because I feel like,
you know, you know, there's different
[SPEAKER_01]: water out there, you know, there's
different, different water, different
[SPEAKER_01]: cities.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the quality of water is
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the waters don't have enough
oxygen, even though, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: water is H2O with a molecule of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think it's important to
oxygenate the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just going to help,
help to help maintain that aerobic
[SPEAKER_01]: environment for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how often do you feed in that tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feed about every 10 to 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think every two weeks is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you check like the pH or PPM of like
the soil runoff at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually do not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't check the runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had any issues, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think on the tea side of things,
when you're using organic inputs like you
[SPEAKER_02]: are, arguably you don't, you won't really
need to check the pH of the runoff in that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now do you just use the teas as a sil
drench or do you also foliar feed using
[SPEAKER_02]: the teas?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the foliar spray when I have,
you know, when I'm mixing in the recharge,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put some in a mist, like a mist spray
bottle, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mostly I do a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about quite a bit in this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we hammered through this pretty
quickly here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of great stuff coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the granddaddy perp auto flower
grow series going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be doing some life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be taking, you know,
we're going to be making videos outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: the studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are actually trying to get to the 2021
Connecticut Cannabis Day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over at Hartford, Connecticut is going to
be music bands.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just going to be, you know,
just going to be a lot of 420 friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff going on over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be vlogging that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to get to more events
this spring and the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, of course, with like COVID,
it might be tough, but, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to see what's going to be
available as we push through this
[SPEAKER_01]: pandemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have a lot of stuff going on this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, for those tuning in,
I will leave a link to 420C's channel down
[SPEAKER_02]: in the description section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys can head on over there,
give him a subscribe, give him a
[SPEAKER_02]: subscription, follow, like all that good
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420C, thank you so much for sitting down
with me talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me interview you and pick your brains
a little bit about how you do your auto
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers, which you've been very successful
on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just, just look at his Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see the size of his auto flowers
that he's growing and knowing kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: needy greedy details on how you do things
when it comes to auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're going to be beneficial
for, for those listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and also the compost teas,
which we talked about, and I think you
[SPEAKER_02]: just did a nutrient tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't watched it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're a video on the tea that you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put out a compost tea video,
not too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was just a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go over all the ingredients that I
use for the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I have, I have,
you know, I have a lot of, a lot of clips
[SPEAKER_01]: on the stuff that I use, everything
brewing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help a lot of people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually a lot of people have been
watching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have been thanking me for
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad I could help everyone that,
you know, that, you know, that needs a
[SPEAKER_01]: good compost tea recipe that's been
working out for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to pass it on to everyone else.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll link that down in the description
section below as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys want to hear more details
about how he does this aerated compost
[SPEAKER_02]: teas, click that down there and check it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any final words?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we covered a lot today,
you know, a lot in a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks again for coming on and enjoy
the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
