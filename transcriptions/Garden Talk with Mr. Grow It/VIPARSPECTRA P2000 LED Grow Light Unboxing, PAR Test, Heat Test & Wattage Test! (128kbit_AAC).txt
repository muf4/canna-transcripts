[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: ViperSpectra sent me over their P2000 LED
grille light, and in this video I am going
[SPEAKER_00]: to unbox the unit, and I'm also going to
test the PAR output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all the grille
light's features in this video,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will link it down in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first thing out the box is the
fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that there's this card which tells
you what to do if you're happy or if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is the instruction manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This includes information such as safety
information, information about the P1000,
[SPEAKER_00]: the P1500, and the P2000, and it also
includes some usage suggestions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to use these suggestions for
our PAR test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with two rope ratchet hangers,
one wire hanging kit, and the last thing
[SPEAKER_00]: here is a power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Rage PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340nm to 1040nm,
and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do these PAR tests just to give you a
general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grosthence,
which have reflective walls, that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the numbers, so just keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the test here, I'll set it to 100% for
all the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the measurements according to the
manufacturer's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, that's 4 feet by 3.5 feet
for the vegetation stage at 24 inches
[SPEAKER_00]: away, and 3 feet by 3 feet flowering
coverage area at 20 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plugged the P2000 LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter, and it shows 1.72 amps,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 204 watts at the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have provided a link to this grow light
down in the description section below so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also did a PAR test on the P1000 LED
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video in the outro card,
and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
