[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Josh from Elite
Cut Genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, Chris?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how's it going to the community?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to have you on here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a while since I had a breeder on
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been quite some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good conversations when we're
talking about plant breeding because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so many different avenues you can
go down, so much we can get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this particular episode, we're going to
talk about breeder ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to talk about mistakes
that breeders make and get into some
[SPEAKER_01]: controversial topics when it comes to
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get deep into it, can you do an
introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Josh, founder of Elite Cut Genetics,
breeder from the Chicagoland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got into the plant we all
know and love, started reading a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: it from the Jorge Cervantes book.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had The Girl Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was called The Girl Bible.
[SPEAKER_00]: He also had a box set DVD for setting up
rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was a two or three DVD set.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was around 2007, 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started reading about it and getting
into it, but it didn't really start until
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011, which was that summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, it was highly illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't really have what we have now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be talking, have a community of
growers who can all talk, share genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very hush-hush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and my best friend, we were both
reading this together, always hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: from childhood.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me and him talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to do it for years, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That year, 2011, we decided to start a
guerrilla garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went into the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got seeds from Attitude Seed Bank back
in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent it in a t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all sketched to try to order seeds
and genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really access like there is
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to order basically from the
European guys who were running it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the Barney's Farm, Denefen,
and we had the Blue Hash Plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: California Hash Plant, Critical Plus,
Vanilla Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the first ever autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking back, it's crazy because it came
so far with autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back then, it was a new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, oh, hey, we can get an extra
harvest in the middle of summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the original lowrider seeds,
which are the first ever autoflowers ever
[SPEAKER_00]: made.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the ones I just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three different patches out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was lowriders, then we had another
patch like five over here, and another
[SPEAKER_00]: patch over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Learning from the book and the DVDs,
it was like, never take the same path
[SPEAKER_00]: twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time we went out there, it was like
a mission.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be like, we're in the army or
something, giving hand signals,
[SPEAKER_00]: listening, going out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when we did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a lot of work, I can tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lugging soil out there, it turned into a
huge undertaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a creek there out in the woods,
so we had water access.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a forest preserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was really no one going through
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides, there's a couple of ranches where
guys on horseback go through on the horse
[SPEAKER_00]: trails.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was basically it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were out there, and that same summer,
I actually got raided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like many of us in those days,
got in trouble for working with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was August 15th, 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts us right when the plants start
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have all this stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me with, I think it was around
six pounds or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I need money for lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got me for a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I don't have ways to bring the funds
back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're committed to this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to finish this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not just a want or a need.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a need now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to finish this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to go out there and harvest,
which was another whole thing that took
[SPEAKER_00]: way longer than I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going out there, like, okay, I'll hack off
the branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out there, and I couldn't even cut the
stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a pop can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I had the nice clippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be good, but no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just doing the branches, just leaving
the main stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stuffing them in bags, and then my
buddy would come down, pick me up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it in the trunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to take multiple trips.
[SPEAKER_00]: This whole time, obviously, I'm paranoid
and freaking out because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: cooperate with the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next day, I bonded out $8,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I left, they were tailing me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already at my mom's house,
which they just found out who was related
[SPEAKER_00]: to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're already waiting because they're
like, this dude's got to grow somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They found notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't know what it pertained to.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was some stuff in the works,
but it just never happened because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011, we did it, and we pulled it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to involve a couple other people,
like my girlfriend's brother and his
[SPEAKER_00]: friend, because now I couldn't have this
stuff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at six to eight years as a
20-year-old kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's traumatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely traumatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, it was like, man,
I got to do this now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got lawyer fees, all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had to involve a couple other people,
so we broke them off too, but we had all
[SPEAKER_00]: this bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, the blue hash, the cadley
hash plant, vanilla cush, and all those
[SPEAKER_00]: old school European breeders, like
Barney's Farm and Denefem, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: freebies you'd get from Attitude,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planned some of those too, but those were
the main ones I can remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, pretty much took a 10-year
hiatus off of anything plant-related,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was a good three or four years
of just fighting in court for my freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took cars, laptops, TVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just cleared you out, especially when
you're not cooperating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they're going to make an example
of you and mock you while you're sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: there, cuffed up or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was living in California for a few
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't doing anything with cultivation,
but we know COVID happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people started getting laid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the time, my girlfriend was pregnant
with our first son.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from the Chicagoland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved back for family support.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I moved back, the laws were
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a completely different time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instantly, I was like, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing and very quickly just
started doing more, doing more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before six months were up, I was already
crossing stuff, making feminized crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing that I released.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just experience, just building it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting the hang of it and seeing
what comes out on the other end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checking out the progeny to see what they
express and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Picked up some small lighting deals right
around then to Spider Farmer Viper
[SPEAKER_00]: Spectra, sending me lights to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when it started, but like I said,
there was a long hiatus and we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: going pretty much since the pandemic
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been going at it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going at it and just keep making
connections and establishing those
[SPEAKER_00]: networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being around people who share a passion
with what I love.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's therapeutic for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people can relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spending time with my plants, taking care
of my plants and creating new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeding life around the globe when you're
sending seeds out to different countries
[SPEAKER_00]: and all over the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing these out and getting to
see those pictures and just knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's happening all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're help spreading that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's an amazing feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much how it started.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to keep going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you've been through a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, they'll just give up
after getting busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You came back to it and you gained that
motivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it mostly just the legalization that
happened within your area that got you
[SPEAKER_01]: back into it and still having that love
for the plant or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved gardening already.
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad's instilled that on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had gardens ever since I was little.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got chickens now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandmother, we used to go get cool
fancy house plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd get to pick out one too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you can pick one out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: There'd be a greenhouse where they're
selling all these cool plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was involved with that at an early age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's an ultimate revenge on my
past and everything that happened to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was taken from me at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being ahead of my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people wanted to start up grows
and yeah, it was like the money grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, money was a factor, but it was like,
man, I just really wanted to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had subscriptions for high time
magazines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got the boxes just straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: A five-year subscription.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worth the high times magazines getting
sent to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up big boxes of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just basically seeing that the laws
are changing, seeing that the stigma is
[SPEAKER_00]: changing and seeing that I can participate
and become a legal business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that just felt right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like a calling to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing it on the side for a few years
before I launched Elite Cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I launched Elite Cut on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was December 22nd, 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right at the end of 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, yeah, just over a year and a
half or close to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a crazy journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, an ultimate revenge on my
past and everything that's happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just motivates me to just like,
dude, you're on the right track.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt this calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just started as an idea because I
worked in warehousing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you've talked about you still work
at Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know being a warehouse grunt that can
get old very fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of equipment all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, you have liquor.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a Coca-Cola, not water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things that you deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being around a lot of people who don't
have that mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have that entrepreneurial
mindset and you want more for yourself,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't really connect with these
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like being around these people are
just going to bring you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to surround yourself with people
who are doing things you want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get into the rooms that you
weren't in before, you know, and connect
[SPEAKER_00]: with people who are entrepreneurs or who
have their own businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like that's the circle I'm
building now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like a great community in the
Midwest here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've met some amazing people and most
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're vendors at events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now like I'm working with some of them
and no one's my photographer now doing
[SPEAKER_00]: macro shots for the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, man, it's been an amazing
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am stoked to be here talking with Mr.
Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching you, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you kind of came out during the
pandemic and stuff, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watching all you guys homegrown,
all you guys, you know, so I still be
[SPEAKER_00]: watching an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just what I like to listen to
while I'm working in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, man, it's it's been amazing and
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've kind of sounds like you have come a
long way since you got busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now you're all the way into doing
breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we're going to dive
deep into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to start with ethics.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so there's an ethical way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another ethical way to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you define ethical breeding
practices?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, ethical breeding practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, you got to watch out for the
guys that are just crossing stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging it, sending it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of like fake cuts going
around, people passing stuff around
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, oh, it's this and then they cross
it and they're saying it's this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really not or they're not testing
their their plants that they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, you know, hop late and viroid can
transfer into seed form, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're sending out seed packs that
are just infected, which is just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: just be horrible for the gene pool,
be horrible for anyone's experience trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, really testing your mother
stock, you know, knowing the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're that you're crossing, you know,
like I understand real estate is limited
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like if you if you have to go on,
like you kind of know the terpene profile
[SPEAKER_00]: or you know the cut already.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no matter what, you need to be
exploring the progeny and seeing like how
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics react together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so knowing what you're starting
with, you know, for sure, verified
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and having the clean mother
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing stock regularly and,
you know, not just crossing stuff and just
[SPEAKER_00]: sending it out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to sell untested gear,
be upfront about what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: just be transparent and be genuine about
who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's the way to go about it,
because like, you know, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: guys, like I say, just like white
labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they buy seeds from overseas,
package them and sell them under their
[SPEAKER_00]: brand or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, for me, I like to be hands
on with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like some of these companies have
been so big, so commercialized that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like running through gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's dropping seed lines every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, how can you really have a true
connection to like what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I understand it's a business,
but it starts becoming like corporatized
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, you know, you start losing the
craft, you know, like we want to be kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like craft small batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some stuff will remake maybe if,
you know, it's it's selling out like
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise, it's like the seeds that
are that are made or that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once they're gone, they're gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, craft small batch connoisseur
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So starting off with clean mother stock,
testing your gear, being transparent about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do and what you're bringing to
the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and if you're crossing like other
people's stuff, like like we do one off
[SPEAKER_00]: crosses, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, if you can get the same
blue cookies cut that I got and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get the same permanent marker that's going
around and you cross those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, those seeds are going to be
identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a couple of different
breeders might be making that same cross,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like it becomes more years once
you start making those selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nothing wrong with that
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just be transparent about what you're
doing and, you know, what you're offering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're conversating with me,
like you're going to be able to see how
[SPEAKER_00]: genuine I am if you're talking to someone
who's kind of like wishy washy or don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to question it a little bit
more, you know, about who you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the questions that people
can ask breeders in order to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are ethical breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, ask them, ask them like,
you know, flowering times, ask them like
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what you see in phenotypical
expression, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like the parent lines, you know,
the parent plants, what they bring to the
[SPEAKER_00]: table and and other questions like,
hey, you got the report for, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab report on your negative poplatin
viroid tests, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, asking for tests and just asking
them about their process, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: just asking more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is definitely a good thing to do,
because, you know, there's lots of great
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures and stuff online that you can
just, oh, this is bang and plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, OK, what's it truly
expressing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's truly coming through?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So just asking more questions about what
you're getting, you know, and those lab
[SPEAKER_00]: reports and just, you know, all kinds of
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ask more questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just look at the picture and be
like, fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so do a little more research on
what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: No kind of the terpene profiles you like
to go after, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are a few things I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So testing your mother's doctors,
asking more questions, asking them their
[SPEAKER_00]: process on like what they look for in
plants or what they're seeing in the
[SPEAKER_00]: progeny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stuff like that are all great
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned one of the things you
shouldn't really do is just create a cross
[SPEAKER_01]: and then send it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking like F1s?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people say you shouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say you shouldn't be selling F1s at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: F1s should never be on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just their belief.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others say, no, F1s perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I initial cross, send it out and have
the consumer find what they're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a variety there to choose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on F1s selling F1s?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, you can go a couple of
different directions is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you make some one off process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're making OK, you're making a seed
line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the chill out OG, you're going to
refine it, bring it to F4 or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, maybe you like the grape
gasoline cut that, you know, maybe I send
[SPEAKER_00]: you and you grew that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it in there with it, you know,
cross it to a couple of other things and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what comes out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, F1s should can be sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely one off crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also working lines,
which is like refining it further,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're refining something further
and kind of focusing your energy on a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain process, you still cross to a
couple of other things because the amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of work you put in isn't going to
guarantee that your seed line is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's not going to guarantee that
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like you put in years of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean you're going to be able
to charge a higher price or none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's good to be focusing and
refining on things and working lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, like I said, real estate's
limited, especially if you're a smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder who doesn't have like huge
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you focus some attention and
work some lines, but then you also just
[SPEAKER_00]: have some one off crosses that people can
just select their phenotype from because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of these are all poly
hybrids anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's going to be variation in the
phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, man, I think I think that's
still a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can still sell off ones just as long
as you're not just like sending them out
[SPEAKER_00]: without like any type of testing or if
you're selling them without testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: be upfront about what you're doing and
have a price point that matches it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And or send out testers like if they
support you and buy packs, then send out a
[SPEAKER_00]: tester packs with what it is, you know,
and you start getting some feedback out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, if you run some now, you have a
little more to go off of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you release these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I got my chopped cherry line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like six different crosses,
but like a couple that I'm really into and
[SPEAKER_00]: that our fan favorites is the Black Cherry
Bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to refine that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to phenohunt that one,
bring it to F2.
[SPEAKER_00]: People want it already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And but then there's other stuff that I
just want.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just leave it as is and move on to
another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other product, because we can only work on
so many things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always you always got to kind of pick
and choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and yeah, it can be hard sometimes,
but well worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk about it's OK to sell off ones as
long as you're being transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things should be tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could potentially sell things that
aren't tested as long as you're
[SPEAKER_01]: transparent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a good example of that is Robin
Hood Seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and some people don't know this,
but Robin Hood Seeds, they don't test and
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a little bit lower of a price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, and so they're very
transparent and yeah, there are companies
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that just don't test and they
send them out, but they're transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are companies out there who
don't test and they're not transparent
[SPEAKER_01]: about.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lie about and say they are tested and
send them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's a lot of problems
that happen talking about the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, after you create those seeds,
what do you do in order to get them tested
[SPEAKER_01]: to make sure they're good to go before
getting the market?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have a few close grommies,
you know that I can put the seeds with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and they can grow some out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll grow some out, you know what I'm
saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So and get some testers out too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just getting some gear out there
for people to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, you know, we'll be growing it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man, just just grow some stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to grow it out and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to see what's going on in there,
you know, before you're offering it to
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a lot of that going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to Robin Hood Seeds and
Square One Genetics, same guy does both
[SPEAKER_00]: those Square One Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's the more high end,
higher priced stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robin Hood Seeds is a little bit lower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now see, he's doing the same thing as what
I'm kind of talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's focusing his attention on certain
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, he's like, OK, I didn't put as
much time or effort into this or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it hasn't been heavily tested
or, you know, even tested at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so he's putting that under a
whole nother brand, you know, so like and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's being transparent about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's the good way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, big ups to THC Titan for
keeping it real there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had him on a different podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Geez, had to have been 2017 by now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And great, great conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get him on the Garden Talk
podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to get him on there because he's a
wealth of knowledge and he's been doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: for I believe he crossed 10 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's got a ton of knowledge in regards
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the guys I look up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to like work with some of these
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at some point, you know,
and some I like to say, too, like so some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the genetics we cross, like I said,
you can you can get the permanent market
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can maybe get the blue cookies cut,
you know, so like those can be replicated,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but it's not, you know, there's
nothing wrong with that, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, if you're offering
some stuff that other companies offer,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just part of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But sometimes you get hate from from these
bigger guys who are kind of clicked up or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like like right now I'm working on
like a slur cane number seven line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got a reversal going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the S1 isn't the main focus
because I'm not really trying to push the
[SPEAKER_00]: S1s, you know, from a guy who's already,
you know, selling the S1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I'll reach out to them like,
hey, man, I'm working on this slur cane
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, let them know, like kind of like
reach out to them, you know, let them know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I'm not trying to step on
your toes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just like to communicate with
them and it can open up the door for
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity later down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I'm working on,
you know, other crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an S1 was made and we're going to sell
the S1 and we already know it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since in-house has released it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, we're going to release it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like there's not going to be a lot of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the main focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also got to, you know, survive as
we're competing against some of these huge
[SPEAKER_00]: guys who can just pump out lines month
after month.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just playing the numbers game
on what's going to hit, what's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the slur cane number seven,
there's lots of guys who haven't got to
[SPEAKER_00]: even run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think California and a lot of
those breeders, they move so fast through
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's such old news to them that I
don't really feel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really stepping on their toes,
but still going to reach out and just let
[SPEAKER_00]: them know that, hey, you know,
I'm working on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got some S1 is not the main focus,
but hey, you know, I would love to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even collaborate with you
sometime or, you know, I'd even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'd even put money down just,
just to support that breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yo, you know, I'm supporting your
work type thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into Paul and Chucking next.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another practice that some say is
unethical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others say it's perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, what is Paul and Chucking in
case there's somebody in the audience that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't know what it actually is?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are your thoughts on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Paul and Chucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting some fun and you're
chucking it on some plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no real direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just maybe just kind of seeing
what's happening and you're just crossing
[SPEAKER_00]: it, you know, and you, you know,
there's not much direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if they're just for
you, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hunt through and find your own
phenotype, but if you're selling them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market and you're just chucking
pollen, you might not even flower out the
[SPEAKER_00]: cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, Oh, I just acquired,
you know, Gelato 33 or the permanent
[SPEAKER_00]: marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you just throw it into a reversal
tent, you know, and pollinate some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully it's, it's the right genetics,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, otherwise you'd have some
issues, but basically just rushing into
[SPEAKER_00]: just throwing pollen on things,
you know, with, with no direction or real
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I don't think it's necessarily a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people might consider some of
the stuff we do as pollen chucking,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, cause some of the crosses are
just kind of one off crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know both parent plants already,
but you know, that might be considered
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen chucking or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I think it goes back to like your
intentions on what you're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are you just doing it for
yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to like, hook up with
some buddies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just trying to find something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you like packaging these things and
putting them to market and like saying
[SPEAKER_00]: it's this or that when you don't even
know, you know, you didn't even grow out
[SPEAKER_00]: the cut that you reversed onto all the
other cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even know if it's the right
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've never grown it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, you can muddy the waters
real quick, go in that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's a way to do it and
there's a way not to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically pollen chucking is referred
to the person who just chucking it with no
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose, no direction kind of just doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what if they were transparent about it
to like, yeah, I pollen chuck these and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I did this cross and this cross,
I crossed this with this, this with this,
[SPEAKER_01]: this with this and packaged them up,
put them on market and like, you should
[SPEAKER_01]: get this from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a pollen chuck full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't grown it out, blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that okay in your eyes or is that just,
you know, it's like certain people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to like steer away right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the experienced people,
but then it also depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the price point?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are you, are you trying to
be like, yo, these are $200 seed packs,
[SPEAKER_00]: dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, yo, like, you know, these are $20
or $30.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do other packs or whatever,
you know, and this is what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have the space or the
means to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to offer something that I
think is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of like on a smaller
level, you know, of being a breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, pollen chuck or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, as long as you're transparent,
it's the guys that really, that irks me
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't that like, if you do,
I mean, man, big ups to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're straight up like, yo,
here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy it, if you buy and it herms out
your whole room, I mean, it says it right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yo, this is untested gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is what it is, but Hey,
it's, it's $20 for a pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you got, you're running the
risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're running plants, you already
know, you gotta be watching this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a, you know, Robin Hood seeds,
which is untested or it could be his other
[SPEAKER_00]: brand square one genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be those plants too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still got to watch cause you never
know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where stability comes into the
conversation as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what exactly, I feel like that term
gets thrown around and people,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people don't even know what that,
what it actually means truly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is meant by a strain or a cultivar
being stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of ways to look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like sexually stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it going to throw bananas,
throw, you know, male flowers and
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinate your, uh, the rest of your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is it sexually stable?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, also another way to look at it is
like phenotypic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: How stable is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people, at least back in
the day when stuff was created,
[SPEAKER_00]: like people wanted it to kind of just come
out and be like the same is, is whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: the picture was or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now there's more variation with
these poly hybrids and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people want to kind of hunt
their own and kind of get that variation.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not so much stability in regards
to, you know, it's different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: herms, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the herms with his nanners due to
too much stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's herms where it's actually
within the genetics to where you grow it
[SPEAKER_01]: out, it starts to flower and you see
pollen sacs form at the nodes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as being able to genetically say,
quote, breed those characteristics out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that actually a possibility at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is herms always going to be within the
genetics, no matter what is done?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, well, there's always going to
be, you know, life's going to find a way,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's how they preserve
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it goes back to like selecting plants
and, you know, working with plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's fully Herman out, not,
I'm not working with that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if there's a lot of other plants
aren't, you know, and I'm running like a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice little number of them, you can see,
well, okay, that was like the problem
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that might just be, you know,
the one off, you know, random ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just got to keep kind of running
plants and, you know, find the ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't, you can breed that out,
you know, you got to just keep selecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not going to be ever completely
gone because this is, this is how they
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is built into the plant,
you know, you can select and select and
[SPEAKER_00]: try to breed away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no matter what, like it's going to be
in there, you know, because that's its
[SPEAKER_00]: survival mechanism to, you know,
reproduce if there's no, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: male pollen around or whatever female
reverse plants around that are pollinating
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like it's always something to watch out
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can definitely breed it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just goes back to selecting plants,
selecting the strong, healthy,
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous plants that aren't showing those
hermaphrodite traits, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always a risk no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's like a five hundred dollar
pack of the hottest breeder in the game,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's running, you know, hundreds of plants
and seeing what's going on still can
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely got to keep a close eye on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talking about characteristics,
I kind of want to get deeper into what
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics you look for when
selecting parent plants for your breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously, like we want to cater to
the market, you know, but we also want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be original with what we like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like there's a lot of hype cuts on
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff always coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so we're going to grow some of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then like what's going to really stay
in our stable after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're making our selections
from, you know, some breeder cuts,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then also seeds that are popped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, it's like, you know,
the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big thing is the terpenes, you know,
certain terpenes, you know, flower
[SPEAKER_00]: structure, you know, intranodal spacing,
you know, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much they root, because if you run a
phenol, you'll see like some plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: just suddenly just like be so vigorous and
just root out your whole pot, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some aren't like, oh, that's a good
candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, the terpenes aren't
really shown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, well, it's got the strong
rooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the vigor, but it doesn't have
the terpenes, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like selecting plants with,
you know, high terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of stuff I like is like gaseous
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from a time where, man,
we were getting those OG and sour packs
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then like, you know, like 350,
$400, $500 ounce stuff, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I like, I like a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, with the market right now,
it's like candy gas is like huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like candy gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grape gasoline we got, one of my
favorites, you know, and I'm going to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: crossing that into stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to refine it like my Black
Cherry Bliss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to refine that to F2s,
but then I'm still going to take that
[SPEAKER_00]: grape gasoline cut and cross it to other
like hype stuff that I like, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's something I really like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to bring that, you know,
to the table for other people to
[SPEAKER_00]: experience too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also taking stuff in directions that
other guys aren't taking it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like going back to the slur cane example,
I'm not going to copy exactly any crosses
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the slur cane number seven in
the direction that I want to take it with
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the blue cookies,
the grape gasoline, just to name a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of them, you know, so flower structure,
I like color, but you know, obviously bag
[SPEAKER_00]: appeals big.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, just, you know, terpenes,
we want some dank terpenes coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: these flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with all the new stuff that we're
refining, like I'll be testing like like
[SPEAKER_00]: the different phenos just to get an idea
of where the terpene levels are at and the
[SPEAKER_00]: potencies and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on my selected keepers rerun
those, whatever the top three,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then send those in for lab tests to
see who's scoring the highest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also the smoke experience of people
close to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, those are some of the things I
look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, it's like what we like,
like the permanent marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Leafly 2023 strain of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a hold of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before I decided to make seeds with
it, I wanted to make sure it was something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I liked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, ran it really like I like
that gassiness that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we like gas in our terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely going to make some seeds
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gassy terpenes, candy gas, flower
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few, I was kind of going on a
few different ones that you can look for,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's got to have some dang terpenes,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love them terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and that brings about, you know,
the potency, too, because it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: synergistic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I like my stuff to taste good,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But somewhat of a rigorous process that
you put yourself through and to really
[SPEAKER_01]: find what you're looking for before you're
comfortable releasing to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you mentioned testing several times,
you know, testing a Fino, then running it
[SPEAKER_01]: again, testing it again, having people
around do smoke reports on it and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that before you even consider
releasing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really feel like a lot of people
aren't really taking those steps to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're just doing what we talked
about in the beginning, which is either
[SPEAKER_01]: chucking pollen or just creating a cross
and pushing it to market with little to no
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really going against everything in
regards to ethics when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm happy to sit down with you and
really pull some of these things out of
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe this will inspire some of
the breeders and give some of the breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: out there that are cut corners,
give them some ideas for what they can do
[SPEAKER_01]: in order to kind of be more legit,
push things through testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not just terpene testing, but HLVD,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you're not sending seeds
out that have hoplite and viroid,
[SPEAKER_01]: because yes, HLVD can be in seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think a lot of people know that it
can certainly be in seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's unfortunately a lot of the ways
that people's gardens are being infected
[SPEAKER_01]: is through the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess we're going to touch on one
of those questions I was going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like the clone swapping, you know,
that people do too, you know, and clone
[SPEAKER_00]: swapping, sorry, clone swapping.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into that right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're talking, you meant something you
want to talk about kind of disease
[SPEAKER_01]: management is kind of what it relates to
and talk all about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot, there's a lot of
collectors out there and a lot of smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: collectors, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then these people are, you know,
swapping clones back and, Hey man,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll trade you this for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's, they got all the
breeder cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a list of 50 of them,
but it's like, you don't know their
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedures for keeping
plants clean and uninfected and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like these people are passing them
around and a lot of these growers won't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know like that they even have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're swapping it with another
guy who's swapping with another guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these genetics are getting
swapped around and you're getting all that
[SPEAKER_00]: growers problem when you get that clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we try to just go straight to
the top to like a verified tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery, you know, the breeder,
you know, like close connections we've
[SPEAKER_00]: made, you know, cause I get people all the
time, you know, hit me up like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, well, I got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you be down to trade?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the sure banger 22, you know,
all the hype reader stuff that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no, I can't ever do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like I said, don't know if it's
verified.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know your SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just swapping stuff around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not paying to get your plants
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be kind of expensive if you're like
getting, you know, a bunch of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like there's a lot of that and to be
very wary of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, there's a lot of that
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you infected your other plants
that you kept around and now you send it
[SPEAKER_00]: to your buddy and it's infected.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just going all over the United
States and it's infecting people's gardens
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, lower yields, you know,
and just a lower plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, lower terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's definitely an issue that we
all need to more, be more vigilant on,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, ask more questions, go back to
the asking questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, Hey, what's up lab reports,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we have lab reports on some of our
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to have our whole spring menu
tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus our, our original mother stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have like, you know, mother stock
that's segregated from the new additions
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to drop, gonna,
you know, test all those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you gotta be careful out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause for me, at least like now it's
getting to the point where it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, this, my collection's worth like a
nice, a pretty penny, I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is my livelihood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I need to further create
more genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, yo, this, no, I got to
protect it at all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the way I treat it and the way
facilities treat it and the way people are
[SPEAKER_00]: really doing it is not the way everyone's
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the common home grower, common,
you know, clone holder, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic collector, however you want to
call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be wary of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't lose your collection to,
I made a post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't lose your collection to Carl the
clone seller or Haley Hoplaten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to refuse so many clones over the
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the people offering the
clones to me, it comes out of good heart,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to share their genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it goes back to me not knowing
like what their grow even looks like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is, is there pests in the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that powdery mildew, you know,
is there any type of disease, a pathogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have had to decline accepting any
clones over the several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've accepted in the past and it
took a risk back before I really even knew
[SPEAKER_01]: about all the risks that are involved with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, in the early beginning,
you know, and then you start getting more
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, now I can't lose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't afford both of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like, you know, if you have a
special child, oh gee, that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: like work further.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to lose that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want that to get infected,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very, very risky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even the seeds, I remember I was at MJ
biz and there was a guy who was just
[SPEAKER_01]: handing out packs of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just walking, randomly walking up
to people here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He wants some seeds, genetics,
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of my buddies took them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, he handed it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just handed it over to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm just don't even want it in
my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you, you have no idea if there's hot
blade and viroid in those seeds or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if the guy like stopped me and had a
conversation, explained a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: about it and, and you know, the practices
he did and so on and so forth,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd be more comfortable accepting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, these days,
if I don't know what the source is,
[SPEAKER_01]: if I don't know, you know, what the card
looks like, I'm most likely not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be accepting any clones or seeds from
really untrusted sources is what I'd say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause he could just be the pile and chuck
guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just like, you know, you just,
he just chucked it all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't, you just handed them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He just got, you know, you don't know,
you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's just cause he's a small,
still guy trying to get his name out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of challenges that small
scale breeders face in this industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this industry sometimes
prioritizes big names and commercialized
[SPEAKER_01]: to genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about those challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, we're like, I was kind of
touching on earlier, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're competing with some of these guys
who have like just mega facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they're, they're, they're
cranking out these seed lines like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you know, a real estate,
having the space, you know, and cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, too, if you're making seeds,
well, you're not producing in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's seeds, you know, if you got mother's
stock, well, that those nutrients and that
[SPEAKER_00]: light and everything that's not going to
produce and stuff, you know, so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of money that goes into it,
you know, to like get the genetics to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people, you know, there's a lot of
sacrifice that you got to make for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the space that you do, the limited
space that you do have because it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to limited space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not having licensing to have
like, you know, huge facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: huge plant counts, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to go around it a certain way
in order to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys, like I said, are cranking
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we're only going to be able
to release so many per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, I want to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I'm going to have to get
some out to some people, grow them out
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, make sure they're not Herman out
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, we're not going to be able to
drop, you know, lines like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I was telling you earlier,
it doesn't matter if you worked on it for
[SPEAKER_00]: this long or for years, it doesn't
guarantee that those seeds are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: sell well, all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that time, money and energy went to
really what, you know, and so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of sacrifices we make and,
and for the people doing it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: more power to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know the struggle of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I also like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, it's, it's touched by
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like what I want to bring to the
table, what I truly like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of these guys are just pumping
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I say, it's just kind of a numbers
game.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different market came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This came sure banger 22.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pollinate a bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's run a hundred of each.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not getting that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to release these six
crosses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in order for us to get to that
point, it's like a lot more, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot more time and effort to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, support those support those
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like, you know, we're pouring our
passion into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like, you know,
you gotta, you gotta, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: follow their story and like their
selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like more than just like the brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it almost like takes on a life of
zone once you're at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, like I said, almost
corporatized where you're just looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers on a sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well we're going to do the permanent mark
times this, this sold well last.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do this with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's cool and all,
but like, you know, it kind of strips away
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the passion I feel or like some of
the genuineness that can that like what I,
[SPEAKER_00]: what I'm offering or what other breeders
are offering like yourself and other guys
[SPEAKER_00]: who are just pouring their heart into
this, you know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is our obsession.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for me, this is my therapy,
my obsession.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what helps keep me grounded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going nowhere and I'm keep forging
those networks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like even in the beginning,
man, you know, you have some pushback,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, from your own, your own mind,
your own doubt, your own worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then even people around you,
well, aren't you going to need this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like, well this dude, he's got this
and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you going to, well, I listened to
none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kept pushing forward and expanding
and going and going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking back now and I'm like,
I'm so glad I didn't listen to no one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so glad, you know, I've taken this
journey and, uh, you know, I was,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, I was working in a warehouse
and, uh, I quit, I quit, uh, it's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: a year ago coming up on a year,
but basically I just felt it in my gut,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like, I was still doing it on
the side, you know, but I was like missing
[SPEAKER_00]: out on opportunity because I'm rushing
around all day to try to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's great and taken care of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I go to work and I get off work,
work till like three in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working three to 11 PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm working till like three in the
morning, doing plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to get up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I got kids seven in the morning and
man, it was just getting so to be too
[SPEAKER_00]: much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes mother stock,
like mother health would suffer because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm rushing around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to do too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well now I can't cut clones off her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, now someone's hitting me up for
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm missing out on that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, these warehouses don't pay
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to really say for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, man, if I just put my full
effort and attention into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I can make that money because I'm
missing out on money because I'm here at
[SPEAKER_00]: this place, maybe clearing a hundred
dollars a day after taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was like a huge leap of faith and
just, you know, I felt it was right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, looking back now,
I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been all glamorous.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been all pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been all perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ups and downs, you know,
money goes back into the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just got a bunch of graphic
design done more labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like almost $800, you know,
like, so there's a lot of money that goes
[SPEAKER_00]: into the testing, you know, having grows
for testing your stuff, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of money that goes into it to
make it all possible, but I wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_00]: it any other way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in control of my destiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I got, like I said, I got
chickens, you know, we got my own
[SPEAKER_00]: chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got my own garden, tomatoes,
all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be canning my own foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm just grateful to be on this
journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm grateful to be here talking to you,
man, straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really, you know, so much work to do
all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really, it really has to be a
passion or defeat to persevere and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: going and get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, I have a cross called Chill
at OG and I started it back in 2019 and
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the only cross I've ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's something I've been working
on for several years and it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more difficult for me because I'm a small
home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a plant count.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to stay within.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've done hunts where I threw away
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't what I was looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next grow nailed it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, grow takes four months or
something like that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly four months in order to complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all the way down F3 now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really I probably could be on F4,
F5 now, but I'm picky, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a, I'm waiting to get what I'm
looking forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know is in the genetics that I'm looking
to pull out and bring down to that F4
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes a lot of patience and it's not
easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I commend you for, for going through it,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think when you make your
next filial generation, you should throw a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple other plants in there, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, all right, well, here's my refined
Chill at OG, but I also have Chill at OG
[SPEAKER_00]: to the great gasoline or the chopped
cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you offer a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is definite value in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also like you like mixing in the land
race genetics to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I liked that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's some guys in the Midwest here
killing it with like land race stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I want to like work with them to
kind of get something like that too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like a breeder Khalifa genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got like some IBLs like lemon
Afghani, like a true IBL land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like they'd be a great one for you too,
honestly, you know, but you got your
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan Valley in there, which is kind of
a similar thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Indica, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I want to work something like that
into the genetics too, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: man, it's a lot of work and you have all
those mixed phenos, you know, even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gifting out the product,
you know, not, it's not always ideal when
[SPEAKER_00]: you have all these mixed phenos and like,
yeah, well, this one has no smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one, you know, or so,
yeah, you're, you're spending all that
[SPEAKER_00]: time and it's like, now you got some smoke
that you particularly might not,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, prefer or it's decent,
but it's just not hitting the mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you filled it with like a breeder
cut that you know is going to perform and
[SPEAKER_00]: give you the potency yield and,
and the terpenes you're after,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's like, instead you're putting that
into your breeding projects or it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not trying to yield probably,
you know, you're just trying to see
[SPEAKER_00]: expressions and, and uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the money and time that goes into
that, you know, it's, it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, it is a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not for the faint hearted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do got to like have some true passion
in order to pursue this straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are a lot of folks that are
getting into breeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're doing their first cross or
maybe they have a cross already and now
[SPEAKER_01]: they're working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for those who are
on their first or second round of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I would say, uh, just, just build
that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's like, uh, you know,
when you cross something, you might be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, wow, well this plant dominated the
cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I'm gonna use this with
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if I want that to come through,
well, the genetics aren't going to mix the
[SPEAKER_00]: same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be the opposite now when you
cross it to that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, uh, you know, stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the experience, just keep going,
keep running plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, that's what gets you
better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what gets you to the point where
you kind of know what you're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of know what's going on with the
genetics and knowing the plants you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, like just cause
permanent marker is hot, doesn't mean you
[SPEAKER_00]: should just get it and pollinate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, get it, grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be way behind these guys
who are pumping out the seed lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another struggle, you know,
like getting that cross out, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it ain't going to happen,
but you know, cross it and or grow it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: See if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I like what this brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: The table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what this plant does, what it's
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you kind of know what to expect,
you know, so definitely know your parent
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know, cause that's something
that a lot of people don't always do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so they don't know like what are
they looking at or if they like it or does
[SPEAKER_00]: this one lean this way?
[SPEAKER_00]: So knowing your parent plants is huge and
go with your heart, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I understand we got to keep
the lights on and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, focus your attention on
certain things, but you know, make some
[SPEAKER_00]: other stuff and, and just, keep growing,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep, keep experimenting and don't ever
think you know it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I feel like with this, you can just
keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like never ending.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, and be transparent, be genuine
cause that'll shine through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll shine through man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be genuine, transparent and go in the
direction that you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like we're going to be making hype
stuff and crossing hype stuff or we're
[SPEAKER_00]: taking it with the cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like directions we want to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, for the most part stuff that has
been made yet, you know, so yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a couple of things I can say.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of good advice and really a
lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole episode, you know, this is
something that, uh, we haven't really
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about in this podcast, ethics,
you know, some of the controversial topics
[SPEAKER_01]: when it comes to breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much for sitting down with me
today and talking about these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's, let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find us at elite cut genetics on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also have a website dropping soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even by the time you post this,
we'll be able to take the card payments
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that.

[SPEAKER_00]: and just stay tuned for the drop of the
new website.

line, six crosses, including the S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, so that's been released and one
that we're releasing just waiting on the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully it wanted like a four,
20 drop, but you know, within this next
[SPEAKER_00]: month is the jungle cookies, which is
across a blue cookies and the jungle cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the jungle cake is wifi 43 to wedding
cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know what wifi 43, that was
hunted from over 500 seeds, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: by the jungle boys at TLC collective from
OG rascals, a white fire OG seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 500 seeds were popped,
you know, and that was the one selected
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a cross for my trop cherry line
with the wifi 43.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, so yeah, the jungle cookies,
that's going to be the new drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the slur cane line will be coming
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: First will be the S one.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're releasing that right away while
we start getting some other stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and giving out some freebies of
those to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, get them some gardens right
away.
