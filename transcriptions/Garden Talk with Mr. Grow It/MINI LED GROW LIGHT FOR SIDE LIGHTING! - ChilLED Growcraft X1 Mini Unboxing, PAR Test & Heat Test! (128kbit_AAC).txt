[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilled LED sent me over their brand new
LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the GrowCraft X1 Mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light is used for side
lighting and in this video I am going to
[SPEAKER_00]: unbox the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will test the power output and I'll do a
heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the
features that this grow light has but it
[SPEAKER_00]: will leave a link down in the description
section below so you can click on that to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more about the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first thing out the box are these
cables.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the cables is an extension cable
that goes from the LED grow light to the
[SPEAKER_00]: driver and then there's a cable that goes
from the driver to the wall outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this bag there is a dimmer and there's
also two rope ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this box is the mean wall driver and
lastly is the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilled LED is actually giving one of
these away and they're also giving away an
[SPEAKER_00]: X1.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link to the giveaway down in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that to learn more about
the giveaway and to join it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the part test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Rage Power Meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part test isn't meant to be exact
it's meant to give you a general idea for
[SPEAKER_00]: what the power output is especially since
this is for side lighting like I mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements and grow tents that
have reflective walls that will increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you saw when I unboxed the light this
light does come with a dimmer I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: plug the dimmer in so the grow light is
operating at 100% for this part test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take measurements at three different
distances 12 inches, 18 inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the LED grow light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 0.56 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 67.5 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a link to the giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: ChilledLED is giving away one of these X1
minis as well as one of the regular X1
[SPEAKER_00]: grow craft lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys

[SPEAKER_00]: up and I will leave it at that.
