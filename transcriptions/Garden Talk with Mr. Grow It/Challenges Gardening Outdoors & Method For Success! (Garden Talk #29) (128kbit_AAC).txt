[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it keeps raining and you're like,
damn, I got to water in my liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get nutrition in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a conundrum because your
plant's wet already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's good to cover yourself
with, well, it's been raining,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I did have some top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside, thinning your plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're out there scouting for pests,
you're not going crazy through,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you got to thin it out a little for
air movement and not creating
[SPEAKER_01]: microclimates for pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes, man, game changer for the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't think it's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to think this as well, like,
oh, well, I'm using synthetic nutrients or
[SPEAKER_01]: salt based nutrients or this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to work well with the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can work together for sure in your
grow media.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your plants as happy and healthy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps a ton with pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant that's ailing or showing signs
like the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they'll come to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have an easier chance of taking it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Dude from the Dude
Grow Show.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always love a little grow talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just, yeah, it makes me
feel iry inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of positive feedback in the comment
section there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really like to see you.
[SPEAKER_00]: See these collabs happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like you get more and more
positive feedback in the comment section
[SPEAKER_00]: about collaborations going on in the
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you coming on and
collabing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get to know about you and
kind of your grow style with outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some challenges with
outdoor growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it should be an action packed talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to begin, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and kind of how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: First came to me as, I wouldn't say
challenges, but sometimes I thought I
[SPEAKER_01]: could do things better with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the very way back in the day would
be my dad had tropical plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: house.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have tropical plants in the
house, so my first plant was a tropical
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in my bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, we've got to get some ambiance
in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just a little bit of make this
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the lead from there to really,
I've always liked hot stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot sauce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and my brother would challenge each
other with who could eat the hot jalapenos
[SPEAKER_01]: out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's like, dude, I can probably just
grow some habaneros.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that turned into just messing with
people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Drying them, making hot powders,
habanero pepper eating challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I guess finally just getting
into, yeah, the value of medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: was what really, when I started to grow
indoors and then recently, not recently,
[SPEAKER_01]: but later in my growing career,
had the opportunity in Colorado to get
[SPEAKER_01]: some grows under my belt outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just on the backyard level,
you know, medicinal garden for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's it in a nutshell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to grow peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually planted a couple pepper seeds,
actually have the seeds right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a bullnose pepper from Baker
Creek.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I planted like four of them and they
didn't sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to give another shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that was really cool about
pepper is that I found out is like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can grow them in small containers and
get like a decent personal yield out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it, like one gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give you a quick tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had, some seeds have been harder for me
to start for peppers and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you do like a soak?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the paper towel soak with them for
probably at least, I was thinking it was
[SPEAKER_01]: two to maybe four days, keeping it soaked,
watching them just to start to get them to
[SPEAKER_01]: pop a little and get their first little
tail, little root coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I planted them, had much better
success.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to give that a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the board for a bunch of different
seeds that actually can help out,
[SPEAKER_01]: help get them excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to have to give
another shot because peppers is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: something I want to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not just those bullnose ones or
bell style peppers or habaneros.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carolina Reapers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool to grow one of those
eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you typically grow indoors,
outdoors or both?
[SPEAKER_00]: Both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be indoors typically all the
time, except for when it's summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a, it's whether it's been a grow
room currently I have a five by five grow
[SPEAKER_01]: tent that I have out in my garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So summertime, I find it convenient
wherever your indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it summer, summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I'm usually so busy with the
outdoor growing going on in summertime
[SPEAKER_01]: that to have to deal with both
responsibilities as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: cleanliness you should be doing when going
between the two, because it's really easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to run around and just go into your tent
and go out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now outside for me, I only have
two very small medicinal plants because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're only in one gallons right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically said, I'm going to quit
growing my medicinal plants outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm at because of the problems I've
ran.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Vancouver, British Columbia here
compared to growing outside in Colorado,
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole different animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do keep busy with, like we said
before, I got peppers outside every year,
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I've gotten into strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone strawberry basket crazy because
I love it keeps them one at head height
[SPEAKER_01]: for when you're walking around to see
what's ready to pick and just,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then two, it can help keep a lot of
different pests away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, a bunch of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't eat tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My neighbors are like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey, they're for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're for the wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're for gifting to the neighbors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that'd be what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's growing on as far as what I'm
growing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, no indoors, not until fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things got to cool off too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes summer can just be too hot for
the indoor growers to have the proper
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to maintain all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the kind of medicinal plant side of
things, are you the type of person that
[SPEAKER_00]: chases after yield or do you kind of let
the plants do their job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do your thing and not really worry
about yield as much?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get yield typically
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking like these things
love, love to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not ever usually chasing yield first.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to know what you're starting
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: What either you're starting with a quality
source seeds or maybe some trusted cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so chase chasing plant health first
and foremost, but yield outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: People should remember when you're
thinking about growing medicinal plants
[SPEAKER_01]: outside, what, what is your goal?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is this just to try to see if you
have a green thumb and how much I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has some sort of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but since you can get a lot of yields,
I mean, if you could grow three,
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon plants and dependent on
people's consumption, uh, be good to go
[SPEAKER_01]: until the next season around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that being said, upscaling that
you could grow to 20 gallon plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh my God, this is too much,
too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so no, don't chase yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, yeah, mainly know what I'm
starting with is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what potential it has and that it's
good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's focus on growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into your style of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start with, with IPM and some of
my viewers are going to laugh at this
[SPEAKER_00]: because usually IPMs at the very end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Hey, we probably should have
started with IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just, it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those that don't know IPM
integrated pest management and layman's
[SPEAKER_00]: terms, it's really just things that you do
in order to prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, tell me what do you typically do
in order to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like the last word in that it's
management, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are trying to prevent, you're going
to have pests outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know your area, if you have the
opportunity to talk to different growers
[SPEAKER_01]: or even maybe some of the pests you'll see
on other garden plants, you might get an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of what you're going to have to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so for me here, I didn't talk to many
growers, the area in Vancouver,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially I'm in a little micro climate
where I live tons of humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pests that kick my butt are always new
ones to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was called the corn earworm on my
outdoor buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never dealt with that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no clue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, most important thing I'd say for IPM
on outdoors, since we are in an
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that we're not controlling as
much as the indoors is being there and
[SPEAKER_01]: scouting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also being able to thin out your
plants, uh, they can get so big and bushy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have air movement, uh,
depending on the size of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: but scouting and looking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it can be nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go by it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could go outdoors for two weeks,
maybe a month and be walking around and
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at your grow and have no problems
because nature's in balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are taken care of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but then eventually what happened to
me because I had a nice hops plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was growing some hops just to look cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to do anything with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I don't have time to brew
as well, but, uh, that brought in some
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids, which in turn they actually,
it was this hops plant was right next to
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plant and the aphids just
preferred it for like a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just stayed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, okay, if that was an indicator
point, I'll call that then I'll leave them
[SPEAKER_01]: alone to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually, of course they worked
their way over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, cause I wanted to see what's happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got a ton of ladybugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs can be really good outside for
aphids, especially since they're big
[SPEAKER_01]: enough to watch them just go on in and eat
those suckers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just stand out there with like
hanging out, maybe the pine or whatnot and
[SPEAKER_01]: just watch them go to war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was refreshing when you can see
the bugs are big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our predatory insects aren't big
enough to enjoy that, but when you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: them eating the bugs that are going to bug
your plant, um, that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we can go just deep as you want
with IPM outdoors as far as what to do
[SPEAKER_01]: when we, we see pests and whatnot,
but that's first off scouting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you also, I mean, important pieces
to check the undersides of the leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under side of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want to be looking there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say a lot of bugs you can
see, but a naked eye, but you do need a
[SPEAKER_01]: loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran into hemp russets outside one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you do need a magnification to see
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, spider mites like to start from my
notice on the lower parts of the plant on
[SPEAKER_01]: the underside of the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, before you start to see a bunch of
damage going up the plant, you can usually
[SPEAKER_01]: catch them when you do run.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to do a preventative
maintenance, let's, let's say you notice
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a few aphids or a few spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're in veg, we can preventative
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you like neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like neem as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually don't mind the smell of neem at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supernatural.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's inexplicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive, easy to apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but doing a type of spray program once
every week isn't bad, but I don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: spray anything that's going to hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if things, again, I said are working
like in balance, like nature, the bugs are
[SPEAKER_01]: taking care of each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to hurt anything that's doing
a good job either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but predators outside people that
know, okay, this is my second year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last year I got these predators aren't
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get them quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get them viable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know you have a problem putting
predators out, definitely are a good idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the outdoor environment, um,
there's a lot of good places, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: to source those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to local insectaries to search
beneficial insect, insectaries on Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll pull up some options.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've had anybody on or
any to recommend, but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's Arbico Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just throw that one off the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they have a lot of information on
their site as far as, uh, identifying
[SPEAKER_01]: predators, which ones will work good for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, so that would be,
that would be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once a week spray, is it just neem
you're using or using any other type of
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do like to use for me, I use neem or
for whatever I'm spraying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically I'll use a type of wetting
agent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, mine's Optic Fuller has a product
called Trans Transport, um, which I use
[SPEAKER_01]: and that once a week spray I'm talking
about, you know, if I, if I'm battling
[SPEAKER_01]: something, we got to break its cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we got spider mites and eggs are
hatching every three days and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: variations there, how hot is it out?
[SPEAKER_01]: How cold is it out is really going to
affect the cycle of some of these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you do have to spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're trying to, we've identified pests
that want to take care of them spraying
[SPEAKER_01]: every three days for, um, I'm going to go
for probably at least 10 days to two weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: should break their cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, you can choose both
methods though.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a garden that you're like,
you don't necessarily want to spray and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have access to see what the
beneficials can do for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I recommend going that route too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually will do a combination of both.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I had hemp russet mites, I'm doing a
spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to beat down the population.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to assume, which is the number
one downfall for people spraying for pests
[SPEAKER_01]: is it's really hard to reach everywhere in
your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to make contact.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that can be problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first I'll do the spray cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, I'll maybe do two
releases of beneficials just to hang out,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, maybe I missed some eggs and things
are going to hatch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has always worked for me just to
take care of most pests and pests for me
[SPEAKER_01]: outside have been aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're sizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten thrips outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some spider mites hemp russet
mites in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but we can go into the other things
too, where I talked about here,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in British Columbia, bud rot molds,
mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nightmares, literally nightmares for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll save that for the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about some of the other
challenges that are going on beyond pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, cause that'll be a real good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bud rot in particular, cause I've
experienced that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can also speak about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to mention, um, this kind of ties
into maybe you can tell me if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something else you're asking me,
but healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow your plants as happy and healthy as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps a ton with pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, a plant that's alien or
showing signs like the pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they'll come to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have an easier chance of taking it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I had Chad Westport on my podcast
a couple of weeks ago, and he talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: bricks and kind of how you can measure the
sugar content in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your bricks level is 12% or above,
then, um, pests don't attack the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I thought was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's another way to, to kind of,
um, kind of see the health of your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for those that don't know them,
I want to research a little bit more on
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about your media.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for, uh, what's in your
mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: That can vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking, okay, we're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of times can be what's
available to you and your look where you
[SPEAKER_01]: live or you live in Colorado and there's
like 25 hydro store options around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that can be a variable for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: A base for me would probably be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the HP pro mix bale Pete, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cause it's just, you can get a lot
out of that bale.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's compact and it's usually
available even at nurseries.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have local grow stores and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then in the Pete, I don't make a
super soil, but I do like to put things in
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm cast just some basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, let's put some organics in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worm castings are good to mix in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you could do a 20% mix of worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do a 10% mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your call.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of recipes out there,
um, which is going to give you some
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to give a diversity in your
bacteria and your living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, other things I know you're a fan of
when we had you on insect frass,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a cool product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm learning more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixing that in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, also works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been cutting on and off playing
with cutting some cocoa into the Pete.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to help with it's like water
inability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pete gets hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't catch it quick enough for
your water on the top or it sucks in a
[SPEAKER_01]: little from the side of your containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you got a, the water kind of
beads off for a minute until it absorbs
[SPEAKER_01]: in, uh, different ratios of cocoa I've
messed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done like 25% cocoa to Pete ratio,
and it does help with that water and
[SPEAKER_01]: inability, which I've liked.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually mix in a lot more
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually don't go to, I'm not a living
soil grower, although I do like to put
[SPEAKER_01]: some things in my soul and leave room in
my containers to do top dresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, and then after that, um,
yeah, that would be the base of my mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think of anything I'm
forgetting that I like to put in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, again, sometimes it,
it does vary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, some compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is some nice compost,
I don't mind mixing in another 10%
[SPEAKER_01]: compost, uh, as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this just helps the overall mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people do some additional
aeration due to anything like,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, perlite or there's enough in,
uh, that specific Pete perlite,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most, if you don't have, you're
getting a straight Pete, then yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be adding in perlite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perlite for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, there's a lot of good recipes out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Search around, uh, shout out to build a
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got some good recipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have, if you want to get
that veil of Pete, you can just get a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient amend kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like in the instructions,
it makes it real easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to go out and source all
these different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to do somewhat of a living
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I say living soil, everybody
typically, I shouldn't say everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: typically knows it's a nose, but an
enriched soil that's going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're relying on your soil more to feed
your plants than you putting liquid or
[SPEAKER_01]: other nutrient inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about container size?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically start in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically end up in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's like, what kind of car do
you like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there's so many variables with
container size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we just talked about this again when
you're on our show, shout out to coming on
[SPEAKER_01]: the dude grow show, but what, how are you
going to feed your plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I noticed and I'm learning my peppers
that I have now, which I think almost too
[SPEAKER_01]: small are in one gallon containers,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to feed those a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One gallon isn't, as we call it,
a big enough battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's just not, it can't hold enough
organic matter, nutrition, whatever that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets fed, liquid nutrients, uh,
quite often the bigger your container,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigger battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but if you can have an enriched mix,
let's say, but I'm gonna tell people,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, it's still relevant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to tell people to do at least
a 10 gallon outside, but you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that just has maybe a small
apartment with a balcony and they do three
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers in a, uh, in three gals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but I guess we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to go at least, I'm going to say 20
to 25 gallon if I can outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you don't want to be chasing after
water on hot days, depending on your
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so the smaller the container on hotter
days, the more you have to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you do have to keep on them more with
feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so bigger is going to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller usually has a little bit more work
on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a little bit more maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and yeah, and container type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I don't like the black nursery
containers, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, it's like, I wish they made
them white, which is probably more
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive on hot days.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can touch the side of a black nursery
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just feel like my roots and my risal
sphere and my plants just going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: upset about that and require more
maintenance, more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, fabric pots are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all kinds of brands out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's different, I use product
called radical bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like a mesh PVC fabric type
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, container size as well as
important container type.
[SPEAKER_01]: I seem to people kill it in the five
gallon home depot buckets though,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or you see people planting the
30 gallon rubber made trash can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the monster street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just planting that seed directly
into that 20 gallon or are you starting in
[SPEAKER_01]: a small pot for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your transplanting method or
techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when do you transplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so you can go outside pretty early or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends, um, where I want to end up,
but I'll just say I go into first typical
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of people, a one gallon nursery
pot size container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will start a plant in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can keep a plant in there for as long
as you want and watch it get angry or hold
[SPEAKER_01]: it back or keep topping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I go, I go from that one gal,
which is going to be not fully root bound,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like ready to go, whatever I put it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to put that one gal probably
into my finishing container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people, so if I go from a one
gal boom, I'm going to go outside into my
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to overwater that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be easy to do, but I skip the
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe people would go to a five and then
to the bigger size container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I just don't want to up pot and do,
it's not that labor intensive for me
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm not doing that many plants,
but I like to go from the one gal to my
[SPEAKER_01]: finishing size, whether that might be a
five, mine is going to be at least a 20 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that's not as, uh, best nursery
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's color Scotty.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does he call it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something best management, nursery
practices or they're typically,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going like one, three,
five, or one, three, like they're keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can keep your plant chugging
along a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but yeah, this is my transplant
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it comes down to personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some people can have space
constraints, constraints are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: start indoors and they're going to stay in
that small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to try to stay as small
container as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, um, transplant,
some folks don't want to, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a thing that could happen if
you have this small plant in a large
[SPEAKER_00]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes down to personal preference in
my opinion on transplanting, what
[SPEAKER_00]: container size to use, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like to deter anybody on,
I mean, this is talking about my grow
[SPEAKER_01]: style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said before, I always say in at
least a 20 or 25, man, you can do a one
[SPEAKER_01]: gal if you want, you could try all kinds
of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's one thing about as far as these
medicinal plants, they love doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love to grow outside when you have,
you know, you're not, we're not worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about having the expensive, nice grow
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the best grow light on earth,
the sun kicking butt for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's, it's hard to kill these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love to grow and there's a lot of
ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my way is not always, there's a lot of
different styles also want to throw in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically use for base
nutrients and additives?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So base nutrients and additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so my base nutrients, so my mix
initially, it's not that enriched,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's the, the base Pete, some cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get a little nutrition from
the worm castings, not much little
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition from the insect frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that could last me maybe a few
waterings or whatever, but I have to get
[SPEAKER_01]: watering this thing with some nutrients
right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually use a set of bottles lacing
recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, actually for like the past three or
four years, I've been using, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ramos nutrients, nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and just, it's a basic, I can follow
the feed chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's eight or five mils of all the product
that's light though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not going to a high PPM,
the highest parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PPM and EC is how you guys measure
your, what, how much nutrient is in your
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have that pen, you're looking
at a feed chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, well, I put in X,
you know, you're probably going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: within the range, um, that they want you
to be in, but that's, that's not my only
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people will be like, that's
pretty low, 700 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I'm also going to take a break
with some of my, as we say that fish
[SPEAKER_01]: brings the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm going to add in, so there's a
bunch of different fish fertilizers out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, a little bit of fish because I like
to diversify what inputs I'm putting in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe, you know, I like some of
the thicker funkier products at times or
[SPEAKER_01]: top dressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you like to top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I used to before I stopped using bat
guano, I do need to do more research into,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw in us like a scary
documentary on Netflix where I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is how they get the zebra.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I don't know, man, and how the
people in their camps, it just didn't seem
[SPEAKER_01]: cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I'll look into it a little more,
but when I had bat guano, it's a good,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, bone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think I have fish bone meal
now, which is a by-product of the fishing
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, which is a high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take these products and I'll do a top
dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's different points in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's blooms really coming on,
um, just to feed the plant in all
[SPEAKER_01]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm giving it's the word
Synganic, uh, we're feeding synthetically
[SPEAKER_01]: or salt-based nutrients and organically or
just, you know, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do stay away from meat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a little freaked out of a big egg,
bone meal, blood meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to learn more about what possibly
might be in those by-products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if any of the antibiotics or
funkiness from that industry comes over,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't, I have other things I can use
in my garden where I don't need to use
[SPEAKER_01]: those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to think what else I do have
some favorite, like, I don't know if you
[SPEAKER_01]: do, like do you water in with any bottles
at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any favorite bloom additives
or something like that's a typical
[SPEAKER_01]: additive or that you would use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use, back in the day,
I used to use PK Booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Used to use Beastie Blooms by Fox Farm
when I was using the Fox Farm lineup and
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was always the, when I worked
hydroponic retail, it would be one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most hottest, like people would be like,
all right, I'm a month into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of boosters you got?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what kind of booster?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is a zero 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like they just get pumped,
but it's not all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do really like it's kind of unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: One massive from Green Planet is a,
like a tricantinol type and there's more
[SPEAKER_01]: in it than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if they can market it as
that, but it's one I really dig on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to think what other bloom
boosters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, if you have your base nutrition
really rocked though, it's not about doing
[SPEAKER_01]: a big booster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mess up things in your isosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can kind of, I think, affect what's
going on with the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go too high in with phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So watch that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, that would be one of my,
my many, many main additives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course I haven't said it in any of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use, I know you like recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use recharge across throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things that in a
roundabout way for me ties into IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recharge guys is just a microbial
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you aren't using microbes, you want to
be adding microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only have so much time with this plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To get it right and kick out a good,
a good crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other microbial inoculants
you use beyond recharge?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you use any sugars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people use molasses,
honey, brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you do any of that or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Recharge has enough molasses in it to
where I don't need to add another sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar guys is going to feed the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to diversify my sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I think if I'm a microbe,
maybe I want to eat something different
[SPEAKER_01]: than molasses today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I get into, God, I don't know
the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox farm has a, they have a line,
something like a Bembe or Bembe line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's actually called Bembe.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a sugar from, I believe from
Beats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can picture maybe some of the microbes,
and this is kind of bro science or just me
[SPEAKER_01]: making myself a microbe, will be more
turned on by eating some of this beet
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar today and do some type of different
attribute in my terpene profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So other than that, what other sugars have
I used?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just those two mainly as far as a sugar to
feed the microbes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another micro product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, you asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did, I haven't since just availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up here, microbes in Canada are really,
it's just goofy regulation thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to get your hands on some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, mammoth pee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I'm stumbling on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mammoth pee I've used on and off as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I haven't in a while, but I would
still recommend at transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some cool, I don't know if you
know any, but mycorrhizae products that
[SPEAKER_01]: are specifically one strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the intradices that it's nice at
transplant to get that on, I think mycos
[SPEAKER_01]: when you can get that on the root zone,
when you're actually transplanting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can put some mycorrhizae in the hole,
make sure you got that connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one good time to use another type
of, that's actually a fungi, mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much use the same products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mammoth pee and recharge
combination is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they both just work so well
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I remember using recharge and
mammoth pee several grows ago and taking
[SPEAKER_00]: it out of the one gallon container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots were just so amazingly pearly
white, like beautiful and just I never got
[SPEAKER_00]: that before, you know, using recharge,
you know, so in mammoth pee together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend that combination for
anybody who is interested in, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: using, trying out some new micro products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Learn about microbes too.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys, you don't have to learn a
ton, but that was in my top three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it was LED lighting,
CO2 and microbes off the top of my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: but microbes man, game changer for the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to do a lot better and don't
think it's a misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to think this as well, like,
Oh, well I'm using synthetic nutrients or
[SPEAKER_01]: salt-based nutrients or this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does, it's not going to work well with
the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can work together for sure in your
grow media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, look into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not, it'll, it'll help your
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned one other thing on
feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned Ramo nutrients and
you mentioned, mentioned these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing some top feeding fish,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you following the feeding schedule for
Ramo nutrients at all, or are you doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced dose or are you not looking at
that feeding schedule?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to just have a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I feel the feeding schedule as a
basis, they're aligned specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy because it's always the
same amount across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter what bottle you're using
until you know, if you, you can start off
[SPEAKER_01]: at five mils and that gives you this PPM
and then you can go up to eight mils or
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go up to 10 mils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't follow a feeding schedule,
particularly as far as a new grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's nice to say, okay,
here's a nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me hand you their feeding schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow this and you should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know your quality, your quality,
your water starting points.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, if you're on a well or
whatever you're on, it is nice to know to
[SPEAKER_01]: get either a water test or know your
starting PP or a pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: My starting pH is seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a well here in British Columbia.
[SPEAKER_01]: My PPMs off the tap are I think one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the water is so good here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just nothing in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to know that starting point is good
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that you should succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that'll mess up a feeding
chart is if you have hiccups in the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and you need to slow down on something or
you need to not feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then outside, speaking of all this,
I don't know if this ties into something
[SPEAKER_01]: you got coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your plants aren't protected from
weather and rain, rain alone is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it keeps raining and you're like,
damn, I got to water in my liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to get nutrition in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be a conundrum because your
plants wet already.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's good to cover yourself
with, well, it's been raining but I did
[SPEAKER_01]: have some top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like a tip there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know you got some weather coming,
because it could rain for like a week
[SPEAKER_01]: straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happened to be in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are always wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't add any nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nor are they probably going crazy at that
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cloudy out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been raining on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can't add nutrition and you
know weather's coming, you can always top
[SPEAKER_01]: dress some nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't even have to be organic
amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have vegetable granular fertilizer
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's just like Osmocote type stuff
where you sprinkle a little on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if you water through with plain
water, you're going to get nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that answered your question with the
feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope I'm not rambling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got my cold brew kicking in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a little caffeine going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need to cut me off at all,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually ahead of the game a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question was going to be about
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you touched on well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your water source is clean going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question was going to be talking
about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is your pH good?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what does it come in at to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you doing any sort of adjustments?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you monitoring it all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quick with the well water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys got hard well, like if you got
high PPM in your well water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you get a little pen and it's
like holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like at 400, 500, 600.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know it's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I haven't had to deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times I think it can be calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different liquid nutrients that
you can adjust your nutrients to that PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not giving too much of one thing
or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you do have that high of PPM,
I would like to know what's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would consider a water test if that's
going to be your main source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or after that, if you don't, you got to
look at a water filtration system such as
[SPEAKER_01]: RO, which gives you a zero starting point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why when commercial facilities,
when they got to replicate their feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: plan across multiple facilities or
anything, everybody has the same RO
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the lead grower over here is
looking over here, he knows everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting at the same point, at least with
the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you do have, or even city water,
not just well water, check that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've heard of some people say
they're, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your, do you know what your PPM is
where you're at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it high?
[SPEAKER_01]: My tap is like 485.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what, now what, what's in
there or what does that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I mean, I have the water report that I
get from the, from the city, but I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I can't always trust that either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many, it seems like variables with
what's in the pipes between here and there
[SPEAKER_01]: and the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyway, check that guys know your,
your water point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you asked about pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: My starting pH is seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know most nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about most Ramo nutrients
buffer down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, I think they anticipate a seven
ish starting point because I always brings
[SPEAKER_01]: me down within range, which is going to be
upper fives, 5.9 to six point,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll water in 5.9 to 6.4 or five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, or even high, excuse me, even higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot, a lot of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Active.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to help buffer out and take
care of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a little out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you touched on PPM and EC earlier
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You threw out a couple values.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you threw out 700 PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me like what values you aim
for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people will start with a low PPM
during seedling stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they'll kind of work their way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me kind of your strategy for
PPM or EC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think, uh, it's been overdone a
lot with, uh, people like to push
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants super hard to get the
most they can out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you should come on back and try to
go lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine would be, okay, early veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm around, you know, three, 400 prime
time veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, man, these things are going,
everything's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could go, you can go up to, I'm still
staying probably around though,
[SPEAKER_01]: five to 600.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying if you went higher,
it might, this can be stream dependent as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, depending on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but 750 to 800 is what I've matched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out at, and I don't see, I see not
diminishing, I guess diminishing returns
[SPEAKER_01]: might be the right phrase.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go higher, I'm not seeing more come
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can mess with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, if, if you're growing the same
type of plant season after season,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you change up the strain or the
plant type, then you just, how do you
[SPEAKER_01]: track that?
[SPEAKER_01]: But less seems to be more typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say not all of them, nutrient
companies want to put down like what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to put down the least
amount you could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they, I'm not saying they're
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: To rip you off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they're going to go a little bit
on the higher end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the nutrient charts offer three
different levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen like, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will be like, are you at the master
level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you at the pro level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you at the beginner level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which I don't know why they word it like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: See what your plant, don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Underdoing it's a little better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and if you want to try and bump up at
different times, uh, go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, using microbes, I keep going
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that helps with nutrition across the
board and I have not needed a high PPM at
[SPEAKER_01]: all since doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always lower than the feed chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't want to mess with all
that and you're intimidated by that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put a plant out in a container with
some enriched soil, some compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: water and some microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, there's also just bagged
soil out there that, uh, ocean forest is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most commonly available across the
nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard different growers granted,
uh, it's not going to work for all
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, but man, all they did is water in
with some ocean forest, which is an
[SPEAKER_01]: enriched soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got a harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you probably can do better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're probably going to run out of
nutrition, getting towards middle towards
[SPEAKER_01]: the end, but this, it can be real easy or
easier than worrying about PPM pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but I grow some Gannick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both values, I'm taking care of all of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up and talk about plant
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what plant training techniques do you
typically do growing outdoors on it
[SPEAKER_01]: outside when these things want to grow
like beasts?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can do a lot of different
training tactics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if it's, uh, first would be,
you're going to want to top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause these plants you're going to,
when you're going to go to bloom in
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, it was around mid August.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd start to see flowers come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd assume I was two weeks in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I wouldn't, I would want my plants to
be, and this is relevant to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how big a plants you can grow,
but I would top them back like three or
[SPEAKER_01]: four times topping your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking off X amount of the top of
your plant down to a node.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you can, you know, Google that out
and see exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only time you, you don't want to do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know, like, Oh man, I'm going to be
going to bloom probably in about 10 days
[SPEAKER_01]: for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set that date at August 15th.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the last time I do some topping would
be maybe August 1st.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a little bit of recovery time
for new shoots to come out and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: to be good, but keep in mind, you're going
to gain at least, I'm going to say across
[SPEAKER_01]: the board, two feet, if not three feet,
maybe four feet when you get into bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when training can come in too,
where you're doing your bending over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally make sure your plants
properly watered and healthy, bending over
[SPEAKER_01]: your stems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will just bend to not get a
break.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I even bend to get a little bit
of a break in the stem because I know how
[SPEAKER_01]: quick these are going to recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a tie down method where you're
taking part of a plant and you're bending
[SPEAKER_01]: it way over here, maybe because it needs
to stay below a fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and also thinning outside,
thinning your plants out to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: those micro climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're out there scouting for
pests, you're not going crazy through like
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to thin it out a little for air
movement and not creating micro climates
[SPEAKER_01]: for pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking about the fence, uh,
having the plant not grow over the fence,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you got, I got some, some good
comments on whatever outdoor security,
[SPEAKER_01]: your neighbors, that kind of thing as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you have a question on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people who swear by the 45
degree angle method.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just do this one outdoors particular,
they just do a one bend of that being
[SPEAKER_00]: shoot at 45 degrees and that's going to
allow the lowers to come up, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought was pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helps create more shoots coming
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just like a Christmas tree
style that you typically see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's one basic, easy thing that
you can do for training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, when growing outdoors,
you can do it indoors too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, we're, you know, we're focusing
on outdoors on this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about, um, more, more so pruning
defoliation, lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of that stuff growing
outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that was, that was tying into kind
of where I'm talking about thinning out
[SPEAKER_01]: your canopy, thinning out your mid
lollipop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you said, definitely that's
bringing up your lower branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that can be an area where if you
have that all thick down there where you
[SPEAKER_01]: might get a problem at the soil,
like to see my soil level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was about to say, I like to put
sticky traps out at soil level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's more for indoors for me sticky
traps outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm catching some good guys
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it hurts my feelings, but,
um, yeah, pruning your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lollipopping it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get even more of those shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was hard for me as a new grower to cut
off a lot of the lower ones because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, Oh, there's going to be some good
flower on here or here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but really taking those off and I
don't like to fully lolly pop it up two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three feet, but taking a lot of those off,
uh, to enable, to send that energy and to
[SPEAKER_01]: send all that to the upper parts of the
plant, uh, works great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into challenges growing
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So indoors, outdoors, totally different
battlefield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we already talked about pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one challenge you get a face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I was just scrolling my notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did want to mention one other thing
before I forget about IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we don't have as option as much on the
indoors, um, and outside if it doesn't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's depending.
[SPEAKER_01]: My plants are usually always covered
outside, which we can get into,
[SPEAKER_01]: but spraying your plant, taking the hose
and just giving your plants a really good
[SPEAKER_01]: wash.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a simple plus you're going to
get naturally outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get some type of dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pollen or you'd be actually for me
here now in British Columbia, smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: particles from fires going on somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washing your plants is a good idea and the
same, it'll wash off potential negative
[SPEAKER_01]: egg sacks or pests that are bothering
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it was once every other day and
you're just just clean off your outside
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good, a good tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just blast them with plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you say wash your plants,
are you also talking about bud washing at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end after harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't done bud washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you wash your plants,
it'll show your weak points and where you
[SPEAKER_01]: might not have them staked up properly as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause sometimes they'll just bend way over
whatever, but, um, get that those plants
[SPEAKER_01]: staked up with bamboo, um, bud washing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, it's not the end of the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your buds get wet, um, if they get
rained on, but I don't intentionally try
[SPEAKER_01]: to wash buds at any point with the
pressure, pressurized water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of the other challenges that you
faced, uh, growing outdoors, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I was mentioning is that there's so
many different things beyond pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that you had mentioned
earlier was bud rod.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to talk about bud rod a little
bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that was one that just came.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a few different types.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like bud rot can be just some rot in the
bud that you get from a type of like
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria or mold, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sometimes just buds that are really
big and dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew big bud crossed with white widow
outside and the buds were so big and
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't know I had the rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and this was in Colorado until I
started trimming and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's when it's really disappointing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I wasn't even anticipating it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and for me, it came from corn
earworms, corn earworms.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I understand right, I'm trying to
recall as I believe a moth that lay like
[SPEAKER_01]: an egg or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this thing comes, it's a
caterpillar and a caterpillar looking
[SPEAKER_01]: thing just goes around throughout your
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it does, it shits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have the feces from the
caterpillar in there, which creates the
[SPEAKER_01]: rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, well it's, so that was kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it wasn't actually this
caterpillar would be like a half inch
[SPEAKER_01]: long, um, it going around causing it was
actually it's taking a dump.
[SPEAKER_01]: My flowers that caused the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did not have my flowers protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different ways you could try and
handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, BTI, Bithyllostare gensis subspecies
israeliensis is a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting enough though, these things
have become resistant to it on and off
[SPEAKER_01]: because everybody uses it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the corn earworm usually affects corn
crops, um, but it, it's found in the
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the flower structure, I don't know
if it thinks maybe the moths like that
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like a corn stalk or not,
but it messes with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way for this one that I have
found, maybe when I try to set up a grow
[SPEAKER_01]: next season, a little bit smaller is
putting out the fine bug netting that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can buy for agricultural purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And therefore these moths and things
cannot fly into your plants, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it is just such a bummer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I, and then I did get a little PM,
um, and there's not a lot you can do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I could take that back.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are plants and there are,
uh, breeders for different areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that you might be able to get a strain
that is less susceptible to that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always cite an instance on the indoor,
um, indoor grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, I had four plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three of them completely got PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them, same tent, leave share in
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, this is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all the same type of plant,
but different strains and this one just
[SPEAKER_01]: won't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's an example of, uh, PM really
prefer powdery mildew when I say PM these
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to control that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different sprays and things you
can do for PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be on it, but man, depending on
the size of your garden can really up your
[SPEAKER_01]: labor a lot trying to deal with these
things, um, outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of going back to bud rod,
I had bud rot before indoors and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: briefly talk about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had plants where I decided to do no
training because I usually do training and
[SPEAKER_00]: topping and low stress training and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My audience wants to see something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me do no training for the beginners
who, who don't want to train.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had all these plants and they had
nice real big colas coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and unfortunately my fan died
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The oscillating family had died overnight
and I only had one fan in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always have two fans in your environment
in case one dies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that's something I'm doing moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but really it, you know, I noticed it
that my fan had to have just been dead for
[SPEAKER_00]: like 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no air movement whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the humidity skyrocketed, uh,
overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't, I don't remember if I
like just watered the plants that the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous night or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, what I'm trying to say is that
the bud rot happened like pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, once you get bud rod, it starts to
form, it starts to form like on the stem
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of works its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about a betrayed a scenario in
particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it'll, uh, it'll continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So although I fixed that fan issue,
I still like two more weeks left in the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fans were going, I had air movement,
but that botrytis that's still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't just magically stop growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't magically just disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I got all the way to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I noticed actually that I had
botrytis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's complete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, luckily it was only that top main
cola, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fattest ones, the lower buds were
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like that's typical too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, I just threw away those
top colas as sad as it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were beautiful and it sucks to take
that cola and just throw it in the trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to do what you got to do,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to be smoking that crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the lower buds were fine in
there, but it was, uh, it's not fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: That air movement is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one other thing to mention is you can
identify if bud rot is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the leaves coming from the cola,
if it starts to yellow from the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves, that's an indicator that you
could potentially have bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can, um, you notice, you'll see some
of the little leaves coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: developed flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is the last grow I forgot to
mention on the, and we've been talking
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been thinking, but indoor my last
harvest, I probably lost about not bad,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe 10% of the flowers, but you would
see, I could, you just be looking around
[SPEAKER_01]: in the canopy and this unhappy family for,
not family, but leaf sticking out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a test is to just grab that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it pulls right out super easy,
and then you can see a potentially a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit of dust or whatever,
you know, like that area is contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I did for that is I just
immediately take a, uh, just a plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: garbage bag or whatever over it and then
snip below it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm worried about, you don't want to
turn off all your fans and hope none of
[SPEAKER_01]: that little dust spreads around anywhere,
but assume you're already going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to, when you get to final
processing of your plants, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: run into more of it and just be pleasantly
surprised if not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's not fun at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, and now I also, another tip is I make
sure I set up alerts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use a sensor push alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people use like the pulse,
but I have alerts come to my smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: If my humidity is too high, well,
I get an alert on my smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I need to go take action so I can
see now the fan does die out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I should be getting alert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's not, not fun at all getting
bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the challenges?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've got a few other good ones here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some fun ones here, time or male function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Colorado had four, four outdoor,
four or five outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the first thing I realized I'm
going to need to eventually, cause the
[SPEAKER_01]: first season I put no protection over my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lived in an area where every once in a
while it was almost guaranteed we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to get some hail that comes through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, and I could see, I was like
addicted to, I'd sit at the computer when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd see a look at, uh, the weather
underground or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd have the enhanced radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, man, it's common.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'd be like, I got to stay home
this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_01]: No mountain biking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have umbrellas ready after that
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: I set up, uh, what I call my Tiki grow or
I used, you can get the corrugated,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, greenhouse panels from home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm not a handy carpenter,
but I can rig stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a grow tip here is you can get two
foot long pieces of rebar that are already
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-cut at home Depot and easily pound
that one foot into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they sell all kinds of different
sizes of bamboo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's bamboo poles that were eight
foot or maybe 10 foot tall that the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: diameter of them were big enough just to
slide over that rebar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, boom, now that and some
green zip ties, I'm starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus I want my outdoor grow to look kind
of cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought having a bamboo like grow
shack over it with some corrugated plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: panels works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stayed upright seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can protect your plants from
even if it's just rain and weather and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how to rig something up or even
into the structure that temporarily goes
[SPEAKER_01]: over them, you're a huge advantage there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd run into weather, um, as far as
the challenge here that man, the sun's
[SPEAKER_01]: going away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to get too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had spare grow lights sitting
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't put out two 600 Watts and a
thousand watt HPS out over my outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then had a timer male function coming
home at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dark out and in between my house
and the neighbor's house, it looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: UFOs landing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like luckily at that point I lived on a
court.
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew all the neighbors at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't doing, uh, at that point in time,
my garden was allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have anything to worry about or
to get in trouble for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but that was just rather interesting
to be like, Whoa, uh, talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you grow outside light
pollution, uh, does your neighbor have a
[SPEAKER_01]: light that might shine to where your
garden to affect its photo period?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a street light in front of my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, Oh, what am I getting to do
about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you don't want to have white
pollution coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can handle some.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about how bright it is when a full
moon's out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for this particular situation,
um, it's like, okay, we can't do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to the light that we can't, we can't
vandalize the light or do anything to the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I set up a ladder and actually I
took a piece of foil and spray painted it
[SPEAKER_01]: primer gray.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked kind of gray like the light and
just wrapped the backside of it that
[SPEAKER_01]: pointed towards my house and just used
some, uh, some type of zip ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that lasted like five years as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my neighbors actually like,
thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That light used to shine into our window.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful of light pollution out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anticipate where you're going to put your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to get any light pollution
from your neighbor's security light or
[SPEAKER_01]: outside lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then it ties into smell,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have some smell from medicinal
plants and different, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: different strains, different strengths of
smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, my neighbors were cool, but also
sensitive to it at times like that's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting kind of strong, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but you know, keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can do a little research into that
into what, which plants might give you
[SPEAKER_01]: more smell than others at prime times and
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so those would be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you, did you want a little security
talk at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I know that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was going to mention, you remind
me of, uh, when you talk about the smell
[SPEAKER_00]: one time, it would mean three of my
buddies were trimming and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: FedEx guy came, rang the doorbell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I opened up the door and he had to
have smelled something really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I smiled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, he, he saw my shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a grow shirt on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Oh, that's what that smell was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, I mean, kind of that wraps
into security, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want people to, um,
you know, know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to hide the smell with,
you know, carbon filters or air filtration
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you want to talk about security
a little bit, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you, it was the FedEx guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said for me, it was the, my mail lady.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's at the mailbox and she was like,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next time she's at the
mailbox, I'm like, see your garden at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, talk to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, here's some free recharge.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just make sure she's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but it was all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, keeping your garden, um,
out of sight if need be, uh, keeping it to
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's not a lot you can do about
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the wind's going the right direction
and you have neighbors close by,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can blame blame skunks if need be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, keeping it, you know,
out of sight and, uh, secure as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, things are changing all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: With how secure you need to keep a grow
and, and it really, it's nice to share
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but, uh, the less people that know the
better, it's easy to put things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, out, it's a notify, you know,
this day and age with technology and the
[SPEAKER_01]: affordability of different cameras or
things that can let you know, Hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's in your garden or maybe even
your catching that can tie into animals or
[SPEAKER_01]: pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to know that
something's there that shouldn't be deer,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll really love to eat your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can get other types of pests that
might come in and really like to eat your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, but having a notification if
somebody's been there, somebody's there,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, is good and just be around,
man, be around your plants, like it,
[SPEAKER_01]: be around your grow as much as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's healthy for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free therapy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you will, I don't know about free.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, we do invest in our grows,
but yeah, be around to check things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely some really,
really good advice.
