[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you did that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grud and
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode 3 of 4 on the Happy Hour
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast was actually posted on a
different YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That YouTube channel no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I figured I would upload this podcast
to this channel because there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: good information within these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I talk with Beast Coast
Farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is pretty big on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He does no-till living organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two highly requested things for
this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor growing and no-till living
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Beast Coast Farmers he has a ton of
information when it comes to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's more on the commercial side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's managing hundreds of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However nearly all of this information can
be applied to home growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a home grower this is
definitely a good podcast to listen to if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're either doing organics or looking to
get into organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do actually have video on this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may not be the best quality but I do
have video.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last couple episodes didn't have any
video so this is an improvement,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But enough of me rambling on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody we got Beast Coast Farmers
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got Mr. Growett here too.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing brother?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another day in paradise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another day another dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty stoked to have Beast Coast
Farmers on here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've followed his Instagram for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: His Instagram is Beast Coast Farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah man we're just gonna ask you some
questions about your growing style and go
[SPEAKER_01]: from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Growett I know you have some questions
for him first so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll kick it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I'll kick it off this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right so tell us how did how did
everything start with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you get into cannabis and then
also talk about how you started growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How you got into growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well my growing came right after I fucking
like the same season that I had smoked for
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time I had started growing that
same season because there's seeds in my
[SPEAKER_02]: blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that I had a I have an older brother
he's four years older than me and so when
[SPEAKER_02]: I was 10 years old he's 14 and he was he
was starting to smoke around then and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: was blazing with him when I was 10 so like
I he threw away a lot he threw away the
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds that he had taken out of the bud and
and I had remembered that those seeds are
[SPEAKER_02]: in the trash and I went through the trash
and took him out and it was actually like
[SPEAKER_02]: right in summertime it was like the end of
June and I just you know germinate I
[SPEAKER_02]: looked up online dude straight up
germinated those seeds and put them
[SPEAKER_02]: outside and just started growing right
from there right from right after 10 and
[SPEAKER_02]: right up right every season after that I
you know I was able to get plants their
[SPEAKER_02]: veg inside start them outside start them
outside that season because I didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere to grow indoors at the time but
every season after that I had an outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: crop and you know coming all the way until
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know the more I looked up looked
it up in line and stuff and saw other
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it and you know saw saw this
industry coming coming forward and I knew
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was gonna be you know legit not
just now for a job market you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why I that's why I like put my I
don't know my heart into it kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your very first grow let's talk a
little bit more about that because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually painful for people right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your very first grow you said you use
basically bag seed basically and you grew
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you know so I grabbed Miracle Grow
soil you know and just straight up just
[SPEAKER_02]: started doing trial and error like before
that before they were out they put were
[SPEAKER_02]: put outside they're in a cardboard box
they had like some CFLs in it I made like
[SPEAKER_02]: a small exhaust and intake dude like this
is all when I was like 10 years old so and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was in my closet and then my mom finds
it and they're like my mom's like get
[SPEAKER_02]: these plants out of the house you know for
sure and then right the day after that
[SPEAKER_02]: like I already put them right outside so
like yeah that's what kind of started my
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor growing like it kind of I was like
in the beginning dude I was all about
[SPEAKER_02]: chems it's funny like hydroponics chems
and growing indoor completely sterile you
[SPEAKER_02]: know my my organic side just kind of like
came from just keep keep on growing
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor every single season just you know
and like like you're saying you know some
[SPEAKER_02]: people's first grows are absolutely
terrible and stuff and stuff but you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like mine wasn't too bad in the beginning
you know I've had you know some terrible
[SPEAKER_02]: shit happen indoor but I had a lot of that
trial and error when I was a little kid
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like learning like drainage and
and just you know proper like weight you
[SPEAKER_02]: know how much you should water a plant and
then and stuff like that did you run into
[SPEAKER_02]: like bugs and stuff outside when you first
started yeah I was right about to mention
[SPEAKER_02]: that like I I have never seen a spider
mite in my outdoor garden ever in my all
[SPEAKER_02]: my years of growing and I've you know I've
gone I've gone to other other places not
[SPEAKER_02]: far from my area and you know I've seen
you know infestations and shit so it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like it's pretty funny to think about
but I also have like right next to me
[SPEAKER_02]: cranberry bugs so they also spray
pesticides so that's just one thing I can
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's been keeping them on bay
all these years you know maybe the the
[SPEAKER_02]: cranberry bug pesticides that they spray
got you yeah I haven't seen shit like I
[SPEAKER_02]: have I have problems with like potato bugs
ever no inch like inch worms like you know
[SPEAKER_02]: there's the they are tomato beetles too
and then those those those corn boring
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't the boring corn worms they like
bore into the stem and like you'll they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: leave like a small hole looks like
somebody took a drill and it'll look like
[SPEAKER_02]: some sawdust is coming out of it and what
they're doing is like just you know eating
[SPEAKER_02]: up the stem and then just like taking that
stuff and shoving it out their hole and
[SPEAKER_02]: those are a bitch dude okay what do you so
what are you using for pesticides then
[SPEAKER_02]: basically it's like it's a fun I use a
fungicide like I've used I've been using
[SPEAKER_02]: serenade for a long time and that's a bio
fungicide that's just but insect for like
[SPEAKER_02]: insects and shit it's usually like just
part of my IPM management you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just be like spraying them especially
after a rainstorm because a rainstorm will
[SPEAKER_02]: wash off any beneficial bacteria and yeast
that's on your that's on your plant that's
[SPEAKER_02]: on the leaf surface so like after rain
you'll you'll do IPM or foliar and usually
[SPEAKER_02]: what I use is for my foliar or IPM neem
oil I emulsify neem oil with yucca with
[SPEAKER_02]: yucca so like I also warm the water first
so I have a little bit of warm water and
[SPEAKER_02]: then mix my my neem and then yucca into
that and that's what emulsifying means
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah emulsify will is helping helping an
oil go into solution and that is like
[SPEAKER_02]: really good for that you can also use
potassium silicate silicate ag sil 16 that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff is a really good emulsifier but it's
just good for also using that silica will
[SPEAKER_02]: will raise the pH of your leaf surface so
that will prevent mold and also by using
[SPEAKER_02]: that neem oil and coating it also aloe
vera so aloe vera neem oil those two
[SPEAKER_02]: things will coat your will coat your
leaves and your plant and it'll actually
[SPEAKER_02]: make it so like insects don't like to eat
it so if you have it on there before you
[SPEAKER_02]: know before these insects even come you
know then then they won't even like to
[SPEAKER_02]: bite it onto it you know and it become a
snack for them you know also another thing
[SPEAKER_02]: is having a healthy living cover crop like
I found like having that clover and things
[SPEAKER_02]: living on top just makes it so there's
another food source other than your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: for insects to eat and it'll also make it
for other insects to come to the to it you
[SPEAKER_02]: know so there'll be some there'll be some
you know some competition and that brings
[SPEAKER_01]: us to like the next part of this that I
want to talk to you about and well one
[SPEAKER_01]: more thing about the pesticides do you
worry about spraying that stuff like neem
[SPEAKER_02]: oil and stuff in bloom yeah so like
usually like the reason why it's called
[SPEAKER_02]: ipm is because it's all it's all you know
you shouldn't be able you shouldn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to use anything in bloom you know you're
preventing you're preventing all okay
[SPEAKER_02]: happening the whole time so that when you
come to bloom it should be smooth sailing
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and there's things that you can
do you know that you know like straight
[SPEAKER_02]: you know which I don't do like burn sulfur
or something like that I believe that you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it'll it'll come onto your buds and
it's gonna degrade your product what I
[SPEAKER_02]: think with with pm is you should just do
better pheno hunting and also better like
[SPEAKER_02]: ipm and also fully like just better
pruning like pruning is just like you know
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're there every day then usually
shit doesn't go wrong you know too much
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's like something has to
develop over a few days for it to go wrong
[SPEAKER_02]: you know so it's like for you that yeah
for you to have a priority on those plants
[SPEAKER_02]: dude it helps so much especially when
you're not mixing chemicals and then give
[SPEAKER_02]: me it to them the fact that you even have
to dedicate time and the ph and do all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff you could be searching for
things that are going wrong or something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that you know and my experience with
all with visible powdery mildew like you
[SPEAKER_02]: can you can you can spray it with with
like a hot like a diluted hydrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: peroxide usually I get it in like 30 plus
percent and then dilute it in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: then it'll that'll that'll kill it on
contact but you need to follow it up with
[SPEAKER_02]: something you know to what I say is like
put the sun put a sunscreen on after you
[SPEAKER_02]: wash it wash everything off you know
because because some people think that pm
[SPEAKER_02]: is a systemic and it'll always be in the
plant but in my and also my experience
[SPEAKER_02]: with outdoor you could take a plant dying
of pm straight almost dead and if you
[SPEAKER_02]: transplant it and as long as the root
system is still healthy enough for it to
[SPEAKER_02]: take it take on a new pot or take on into
a new bed then it'll it'll promote growth
[SPEAKER_02]: that new vegetative growth that is
unaffected by them and then also the uv
[SPEAKER_02]: light will help literally kill the mutant
as new plant is growing so there will be a
[SPEAKER_02]: time where you can take a cut of a fresh
of a freshly growing of freshly growing
[SPEAKER_02]: plant matter and then be able to
re-sterilize that and it'll be no pm you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I've seen I've seen cuts that have
been brought outside with pm brought
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor and then now they're fine you know
because of that method right right and dj
[SPEAKER_02]: short actually like um says that a few
things about that in his uh in his bro
[SPEAKER_02]: journals about how the uv light just kills
pm outdoor and how and how you can just
[SPEAKER_01]: take fresh cuts like that who so the
you're the uv light from the sun you're
[SPEAKER_02]: saying yep the uv light in the sun so
around my area june is the highest uv
[SPEAKER_02]: index so if you're trying to fuck pm up
and you have an indoor plant then you
[SPEAKER_02]: should take all your plants out from
indoor and if you want to save them or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that then put them outside
in june transplant them all june you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: veg them and you'll do shit to them to uh
to help them and then take cuts off from
[SPEAKER_02]: and try and save them usually like people
will just toss it you know like unless the
[SPEAKER_02]: medics are very uh priceless or or
valuable or whatever and um when i was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at your instagram most recently i
saw you're growing in what looks like a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of fabric pots and you're you're doing
the no-till method with the cover on top
[SPEAKER_01]: can you explain to everybody like the be
like the noobs what you know what that's
[SPEAKER_02]: about yeah sure no problem so like um you
want to start with a base soil and the
[SPEAKER_02]: base soil you can make in a few different
ways like you can do a ratio of 100 to
[SPEAKER_02]: like um 20 25 25 50 or you can do 33 33 33
um of peat moss compost to aeration and um
[SPEAKER_02]: and uh your aeration being like perlite uh
you can use perlite but in my opinion
[SPEAKER_02]: probably the best two is hydroton and
pumice pumice being the best and then
[SPEAKER_02]: hydroton being the second best and then um
you you mix those those those three things
[SPEAKER_02]: together um perfectly you know and then
you have base oil and then what you add to
[SPEAKER_02]: that base oil um is amen dry amendments
you do you do like um the i did cladmus
[SPEAKER_02]: coots a little bit of a modified cladmus
coots recipe which is um it's a half you
[SPEAKER_02]: do a half cup two two uh per cubic foot of
base oil then you add neem seed meal kelp
[SPEAKER_02]: meal crab meal insect frass gypsum oyster
shell flour and then uh two cups of basalt
[SPEAKER_02]: and then another thing that i added was um
was a half cup of uh alfalfa meal um and
[SPEAKER_02]: uh once you mix that up you know you let
it you let it uh you let it cook for six
[SPEAKER_02]: to nine weeks you uh you mix it all up and
you add you add like you can add just
[SPEAKER_02]: water i had added just water because i was
lazy but you can mix up a lactobacillic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid you can mix up uh you know even a
compost tea or fish emulsion fish emulsion
[SPEAKER_02]: will definitely help you know jump start
it and um like what i was saying about
[SPEAKER_02]: that cooking like uh there's a lot of um
decomposition going on so uh and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: like the the the fungus the mycelium it's
uh it gets very hot so like um that's why
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to let it cook like there will be
a phase of the plant where um its root
[SPEAKER_02]: system knows that this decomposition is
going on it goes into a weakened state but
[SPEAKER_02]: it literally bounces right back from it
you know but usually you just want to wait
[SPEAKER_02]: until that um the temperature of the soil
has gone down and the decomposition is
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to slow um but but that means
since the decomposition has been slowed a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the plant available a lot of the
available nutrients you know is now plant
[SPEAKER_02]: available um and not in a different phase
in addition in different form um what i
[SPEAKER_02]: had what i had done for the first the so a
45 gallon pot is uh 1.5 cubic feet for the
[SPEAKER_02]: first foot at the bottom i had put um base
soil i had put uh super soil and i let
[SPEAKER_02]: that cook in in those pots with nothing on
top for for about uh about five weeks and
[SPEAKER_02]: then i put and then i had um what i had
done recently is finally got base soil the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest 0.5 feet in the rest of the 75 45s
that i had and um and then because you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have to make your whole soil super
soil you don't have um you can only make
[SPEAKER_02]: you can just make uh three to six inches
at the bottom layer fill the rest up with
[SPEAKER_02]: base soil and then just leave that top and
then you can just do like a top like inch
[SPEAKER_02]: of super soil on the top and that and
that'll be that'll that's a no-till pot
[SPEAKER_02]: you can know you don't have to um till
that for its whole entire lifespan you
[SPEAKER_02]: know like you mix it up once as long as
you mix it up well enough the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: all you got to do is top dress after that
what is your crowd or your cover that you
[SPEAKER_02]: put on top yeah so like um i had i had
made sure that the that it was very arid
[SPEAKER_02]: and i actually added a little bit more
pumice and hydroton on the top but um like
[SPEAKER_02]: uh i have this 12 seed cover crop that's
from build a soil i i i maintain a living
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop um and like what i was saying
you know when you have another food source
[SPEAKER_02]: then insects literally won't even eat your
cannabis you know especially if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying your ganja with a foliar it it
doesn't make it taste as good as things
[SPEAKER_02]: that aren't sprayed with a foliar like
your cover crop you know all right that's
[SPEAKER_02]: good thinking yeah so they'll they'll um
you know they'll eat that and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: literally just turn it into insect press
right on your top soil you know and it may
[SPEAKER_02]: can plant available nutrients for you um
but another thing about the living cover
[SPEAKER_02]: crop is that its root systems will help
move macro micronutrients around in the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil in that 45 gallon pot for the plant
to use so like um if the if the ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: hasn't you know said hasn't gotten down to
it yet and the cover crop is starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: get um nutrients on the sides it'll just
bring it right to where it's needed um but
[SPEAKER_02]: uh you can kill you can kill that cover
crop after it's gone to seed so like you
[SPEAKER_02]: keep it alive you let the flowers come you
let all the um let all those things turn
[SPEAKER_02]: to seed and then you can just kill it you
know um and put that mulch uh hay top
[SPEAKER_02]: layer on on the top um one thing that's
really crucial is um not letting the sun
[SPEAKER_02]: when you when you say like um when you're
doing selective weeding and um there's
[SPEAKER_02]: some bad weeds there's the grasses popping
up and then you uh you uh you take it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you uh you uh crush it up and then you put
it on top of your soil you don't want the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun to hit it directly if you can have
some hay or something or um or mulch that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can put on top of that um it'll since
it was just living um and it's still green
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff and it has a lot of nutrients
still in it um if the sun were to just uh
[SPEAKER_02]: hit it directly it would just bake that
off and it would um it would turn to
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon quickly um if you had put that
mulch layer on top those plant available
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients will you know it'll stay wet for
days and then uh worms and mites and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything will will come to it and um
since there that it's like staying moist
[SPEAKER_02]: on the top layer um that's also you know
another thing about living keeping a
[SPEAKER_02]: living uh mulch layer or even just any
kind of mulch layer the sun is hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: your soil directly you know so so like it
promotes more root growth towards the top
[SPEAKER_02]: and it keeps your root your top your uh
top few inches at a cooler temperature for
[SPEAKER_02]: for um to stay homogeneous and wet that's
awesome man that's some uh next level shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's it's like you set it all up you
know like a few times you know and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: just sets it you know it's like a smooth
sailing after that um there's so many more
[SPEAKER_02]: just one plant in a 45-gallon pot yeah
exactly so like i have like all those um
[SPEAKER_02]: they're looking small it's just you know
that's for my winter crop all those will
[SPEAKER_02]: be done towards december you know the end
of december and they'll be uh supplemented
[SPEAKER_02]: light all the way until you know um till
the uh the beginning of november you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's like you're saying winter crops
so he gave us a little bit of details
[SPEAKER_01]: before the podcast can you tell everybody
about how you're going into that your
[SPEAKER_02]: winter crop yeah so like all those all
those plants are um are outside at the
[SPEAKER_02]: moment until they can be moved into my
greenhouse my greenhouse is getting its
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical done but um like you want to
supplement light like we're getting into
[SPEAKER_02]: uh we have about two weeks left of veg and
we're it's starting to transition into
[SPEAKER_02]: flower naturally outdoor um you know um
we're getting about at the end of this
[SPEAKER_02]: month we're about 14 hours of light and
then we'll get down to 13 and we won't
[SPEAKER_02]: even achieve a full a full 12 12 until um
november i believe um but the reason why
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm supplementing supplementing light is
to keep them in that vegetative state you
[SPEAKER_01]: know so you have lights in a greenhouse
that you're going to use yes uh i'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm gonna have 10 uh thousand watt double
ends and oh damn dude yeah hell yeah so
[SPEAKER_02]: like uh it's gonna be filthy yeah so um so
and also like if it's a cloudy day you
[SPEAKER_02]: know i'll turn those all all 10 lights on
and make the sun happen for them you know
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah yeah but um like that shit with the
winter crop man like you just got to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure you're supplementing light properly
if if you're if it's starting to get too
[SPEAKER_02]: cold out then you know you need to you
need to adequately heat them because
[SPEAKER_02]: environment is so key dude you know like
we're just blessed when we come into
[SPEAKER_02]: season that that uh mother nature gives us
you know the perfect season but um i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely gonna have to have like
potentially a propene heater i don't need
[SPEAKER_02]: a dehumidifier um i'm gonna potentially
potentially need a humidifier for winter
[SPEAKER_02]: time uh to add moisture to my greenhouse
you know and stuff like that but uh it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be really cool for sure it's and not
many people are growing a geodesic dome a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people are growing you know
traditional hoops and uh you know whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: the forever flowering uh companies are you
got pictures of that up right yeah yeah i
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have too many pictures of the actual
like geodome like i will i will like a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit further down the road but like
um uh because of my area just because of
[SPEAKER_02]: my area you know not many people in my
area and for the viewers watching i don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you mentioned your instagram yet
it's at beast coast farmers i'm looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: it right now um are you strictly an
outdoor grower now are you 100 outdoor or
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm moving towards that man like um i i
want all production outdoor like i can
[SPEAKER_02]: have a greenhouse where i can be
propagating and vegging and mothering all
[SPEAKER_02]: that stuff and then have a greenhouse
where that because it'll it'll be
[SPEAKER_02]: continuously heated you know all the time
no matter what it's no matter what the
[SPEAKER_02]: season and um but by all means you can
have you know say cloning or mothers or
[SPEAKER_02]: veggies inside but i'm moving towards no
flowering indoor i haven't been flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor for for like two years now and it's
been all outdoor so how many plants do you
[SPEAKER_02]: typically run um indoor like um well
outdoor usually well outdoor it's hundreds
[SPEAKER_02]: it's usually in the hundreds wow and like
last season i had done uh like 250 and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're all in varying size and pots and
beds and at one location and i actually
[SPEAKER_02]: seeded every single one um earlier in that
earlier last year i had been i i was
[SPEAKER_02]: bringing uh my seed stock to me and
trading some growers and i actually got
[SPEAKER_02]: taken by the police for me so i lost like
like five years of breeding and then i oh
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah so last year last year i was like all
right well i'm just gonna chuck pollen
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and now i have seeds forever
but at the same time dude seed making dude
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like you know you don't have to make
f2s f3s if you do it right the first time
[SPEAKER_02]: like i i had fino hunted uh like 2000
seeds so out of 2000 seeds i found five
[SPEAKER_02]: males that were insane so i just let them
hit the wind you know and out of those
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000 seeds i found 250 females that were
you know very very good um like some of
[SPEAKER_02]: them you could you could be completely dry
and they don't wilt they just still pray
[SPEAKER_02]: you know even though they're completely
dry and you can can kick them over and
[SPEAKER_02]: shit um that's that's just from unique
unique lignin uh structures and shit dude
[SPEAKER_02]: it's i think a lot of this dude like a lot
of growing and um is having a phenotype
[SPEAKER_02]: for your area you know um say like if i
take some cali southern cali seeds and
[SPEAKER_02]: then take them to northern you know like
maine or something you know you'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll have some adverse effects happen
for sure or if you take clones that were
[SPEAKER_02]: under sea level or above sea level and do
vice versa you know that's why people need
[SPEAKER_02]: to have acclimated strains and make their
own you know because um making your own
[SPEAKER_02]: strains it they'll grow perfectly where
you live you know um just by making a few
[SPEAKER_00]: generations of them so with with hundreds
and hundreds of plants that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: managing at a time seems like a lot of
work there what advice do you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are trying to do the same thing
you know what management advice man dude i
[SPEAKER_02]: i just i recommend just doing the organic
route you know like it's easy you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's like less things i need to do
for them and plant health is maintained
[SPEAKER_02]: you know on a on a larger scale you know
um if you were to give plants chems you
[SPEAKER_02]: need to um you know have every plant being
wet the same way and then flushed or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever and also um a lot more plant
diseases and um things can happen from
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know so like i i just recommend
going down the organic route not not going
[SPEAKER_02]: the chems and having to water things in to
achieve what you want you know to find our
[SPEAKER_01]: results and stuff because you're just
spraying them with a hose at this point
[SPEAKER_01]: really right like are you wanting to tap
water or do you have like a ro thing set
[SPEAKER_02]: up i used to do i used to do ro you know
like um i i don't i'm not working with
[SPEAKER_02]: city water you know or anything like that
or chlorinated got you i have i have two
[SPEAKER_02]: separate wells for both my locations and
like it's you know well water the well
[SPEAKER_02]: water i'm pulling is uh my first one is uh
80 tds and the other one is 120 and um wow
[SPEAKER_02]: that's low for especially for well water
yeah and um what's in it is magnesium
[SPEAKER_02]: calcium uh small amounts of iron silica
you know all shit that i'd be adding to it
[SPEAKER_02]: it's pretty funny you know and uh you'd
even you even drink it or put it on your
[SPEAKER_02]: skin it makes it soft from its mineral
content so like just from that like giving
[SPEAKER_02]: that to bacteria or or giving that to a
fungus you know stimulates it um watering
[SPEAKER_02]: is definitely a key though man like i i
don't just i don't always just give them
[SPEAKER_02]: water like the more you give a plant the
better the bigger it'll get in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: teas you know and brewing teas um but i
can by all means i mix up soil that can
[SPEAKER_02]: just be sustained with just water
beginning to end like that cutes mix like
[SPEAKER_02]: from uh the claddened scutes recipe i'm
gonna have to look at that yeah for sure
[SPEAKER_02]: like that's right on buildaspoil.com too
uh buildaspoils and shit i had spent a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of dough on builda soil uh this season
even though i'll probably try and uh
[SPEAKER_02]: source some things on the post um and only
have to order a few things from them next
[SPEAKER_02]: year but um but by all means like they're
the shit they give you free information
[SPEAKER_00]: you know in the whole nine yards what has
been your biggest yield so far too big
[SPEAKER_02]: probably like 25 30 pounds like that of of
sensi you know yeah that's a that's record
[SPEAKER_01]: breaker for the podcast so far i'm pretty
sure that's like you know at one time you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and uh the the money that i had spent
dude to do that like it's nothing dude
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like it's it's almost it's almost
nothing it's like it's like my the ounces
[SPEAKER_02]: and the pounds are are uh the ounces are
like pennies about um with with using
[SPEAKER_02]: organics and using the sun and shit like
that so that was that was an outdoor grow
[SPEAKER_00]: and then how many plants was it roughly
that was off of like 80 plants okay like
[SPEAKER_02]: and but you know usually you know like i
can yield off of one plant i can go over
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like 2.5 you know and um bigger
than that you know um it's all about the
[SPEAKER_02]: veg it's all about filling in a screen you
know too uh it's gonna be funny like this
[SPEAKER_02]: is this season is the biggest season that
i've ever gone and then like next season
[SPEAKER_02]: you know even bigger and bigger that's how
it's always been like uh i when i look at
[SPEAKER_01]: your instagram like you talk about filling
in a screen you're not scrawling all these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are you um no but the ones that are
gonna go into the geodome that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: a scrog net completely 500 like almost 531
square feet of scrog and oh wow yeah and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's you know the canopy will be six uh
about six and a half seven feet tall so
[SPEAKER_02]: you'll be on a stepladder you know just
looking at the canopy it's gonna be sick
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to um you're so i noticed
like you're doing like you're you're
[SPEAKER_01]: training the plants and pulling them down
like the branches down yeah like and i do
[SPEAKER_02]: that every day you know i could i have uh
the bamboo i just found actually a local
[SPEAKER_02]: like uh um bamboo spot to just go get mad
bamboo and and like start doing more
[SPEAKER_02]: training but um i i completely you know
you don't have to top your plants either
[SPEAKER_02]: you can um you can regulate you can you
can uh get oxen to be you know regulated
[SPEAKER_02]: just by bending the plant oxen is uh the
whole a growth hormone that that uh is
[SPEAKER_02]: responsible for the elongation and uh when
you when you take off the apical mirror
[SPEAKER_02]: then uh you're you're you know um it's
like a shock to the plant you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's i don't know um it can be beneficial
but by all means all you if the plant is
[SPEAKER_02]: able to just be bent um and then held down
in that bent position then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: achieving the same you know but better
you're you don't have to do any kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stress like cutting the plant up uh you're
maintaining more growth matter are there
[SPEAKER_01]: any books that you can like reference that
you've learned this stuff from or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: all just from like trial and error and the
internet i've i've definitely i've been
[SPEAKER_02]: reading a few books like um teeming with
fungus teeming with microbes teeming with
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients uh mycelium running uh but you
know and um a lot of a lot of trial and
[SPEAKER_02]: error dude you know higher hybrid you know
i've watched videos for so long dude and
[SPEAKER_02]: like i got i literally did a huge you know
like um uh like 25 gallon like a few 25
[SPEAKER_02]: gallon dwc well rdwc all connected and
shit and uh and um replicated his style
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and i love it i still to this day
i still love hydroponics i still respect
[SPEAKER_02]: it but i just won't go down that route
again it's just uh it's too wasteful you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you just you know you you don't you
don't think about what when it where it
[SPEAKER_02]: goes down the drain on a small scale you
know it doesn't matter you know if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: not if when you get to a larger scale and
you're dealing with hundreds of plants
[SPEAKER_02]: then you should you should be you should
think about what you're putting into the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground and then where that water going and
all that because anyone can just you know
[SPEAKER_02]: spend money you know on chems and then
just spew them on anything you know to
[SPEAKER_02]: make money or something like that but
that's not what it's about yeah for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: bro i agree with you there um and i agree
that doing a large scale with chemicals is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be i mean like how are you going
to be able to afford to do that it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah you know by all means you know like a
small you can spend a thousand dollars and
[SPEAKER_02]: get 10 grand back at you easily you know
over that you know with or whatever it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's funny how how much it actually
[SPEAKER_02]: costs to make a pound be better for you
and the whole nine yards terpene content
[SPEAKER_02]: the terpene content from organic and by
using the sun it's unmatched you'll never
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to get the terpenes that you get
from outdoor indoor you know just uh
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just the way it is what was your
biggest catastrophe in growing definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor uh powdery mildew indoor you know
i've i've gone through fighting the battle
[SPEAKER_01]: through flower is that the third powdery
mildew indoor we've heard it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: almost every podcast powdery mildew is
brought up at least it's not like butter
[SPEAKER_02]: mites or some shit you know um definitely
pm dude it's insane like it what i think
[SPEAKER_02]: is just like um powdery mildew for indoor
dude it's like it's if you even see that
[SPEAKER_02]: dude it's like catastrophic catastrophe
you know like has it crushed your yield or
[SPEAKER_02]: what yeah it the fact that you see it it's
cutting your yield like it's it's um you
[SPEAKER_02]: shouldn't fight the battle going into
flower you know if you seed and veg
[SPEAKER_02]: already don't flower you know it's like um
cut everything uh get new genetics uh
[SPEAKER_02]: don't don't accept genetics from somebody
you don't really know very well and then
[SPEAKER_02]: start or start from seed and start with a
very sterile sterile room um sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that is is the better option than
fighting the battle anyone dealing with pm
[SPEAKER_02]: dude it's like you should really rethink
about what you're doing you know because
[SPEAKER_02]: um it's it's just a battle not worth
fighting you should always be doing ipm uh
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated pest management so you never
see that shit you know you should have
[SPEAKER_02]: your you know a regiment that you you know
everyone has their own regiment that they
[SPEAKER_02]: do and um it's it's crucial like um you
can make a a lactobacillic acid very it's
[SPEAKER_02]: very easy to make you take um you take
rice rice wash water so you all you do is
[SPEAKER_02]: you take rice and you add some water and
you um and then you mix it around and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you you strain out the rice and then you
add it to uh raw milk at um a one to ten
[SPEAKER_02]: ratio so one part wash water ten part milk
and then you let that um you let that uh
[SPEAKER_02]: you let that sit for 48 hours and uh
within within 12 hours within 24 hours
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll already start separating uh cheese
curd at the top and then lactobacillic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid serum on the bottom and um you just
take the cheese curd you can make meat
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese out of it and then um that serum on
the bottom is is an ipm you know like you
[SPEAKER_02]: you should spray lactobacillic on your
lactobacillic acid on your plants like and
[SPEAKER_02]: almost every day you know like or like
three times four times four times a week
[SPEAKER_01]: or something i feel like people are going
to get a lot of value out of here in that
[SPEAKER_02]: well for sure dude yeah and um uh like
korean natural farming is like something
[SPEAKER_02]: that everyone needs to start doing for
growing their food growing for their ganja
[SPEAKER_02]: and all that shit just the amount of money
that it takes to to to make the end result
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's just it's insane like to
just low right you're saying namely low
[SPEAKER_02]: dude like for like hundreds and hundreds
of acres to adequately like water that
[SPEAKER_02]: with say fermented plant juice would
probably cost you like maybe 50 dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: you know if you know for 100 acres for
like 300 acres yeah and uh all you got to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is grow the plant matter you know it
makes sense yeah right it's one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller time people i don't know if
they're gonna be getting into it like the
[SPEAKER_01]: newer i don't know like the new growers
but yeah man i mean when i was a new
[SPEAKER_02]: grower like i was saying it's all about
ken so i was just looking into what
[SPEAKER_02]: company is doing you know is has the best
prices and best results and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: super easy to get like to walk into a
grocery store yep like the first time i
[SPEAKER_01]: walked into a grocery store i bought like
a lot more than i needed i know and i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: sure they had smile on their face yeah
like exactly i mean that's the thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: going in the grocery shop and like looking
at a magazine yeah is they're gonna try to
[SPEAKER_01]: convince you that you need to use as many
bottles of nutrients as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: regardless of the company i mean they're
all there to make money yep and so exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a reason there's 10 part systems
and not three part systems yeah you'll see
[SPEAKER_02]: the organics side and it'll just be a
little you know it'll be a little section
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go into and you know um everything
else is kems everything you know kems
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and the i'm sure the people in
there won't won't you know um you know
[SPEAKER_02]: bring up anything about organics or or
whatever if unless you ask or unless
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for it you know right
because the margins are going to be as
[SPEAKER_01]: good for they're not going to make as much
as much money selling you organic stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: and on top of that like the marketing that
these companies are doing it's pretty cool
[SPEAKER_01]: like you go in there and you look at all
the nutrient bottles like they'll make a
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle of salt look cool yeah for sure
dude right and it's and everything's just
[SPEAKER_02]: you know got the same shit in it and in
different quantities and whatever else for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it's easy to get lost in there yeah
and to say that it's you know like um it's
[SPEAKER_02]: tested or it's um it's commercially you
know it's used like advanced nutrients i
[SPEAKER_02]: was like contacted by the like east coast
advanced nutrient guy and he's like oh you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you should start using a commercial
nutrient or something like that i'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: like you know i always just delete that
the years you know when i was younger like
[SPEAKER_02]: i had poured kems right on an organic
garden you know like general hydroponics
[SPEAKER_02]: and i had yielded i had yielded more than
i would have yielded but you know i had
[SPEAKER_02]: hurt that ground you know and in it um and
then it would need time to repair itself
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and for those salts to fully
leach off and drain off and for whatever
[SPEAKER_02]: else but like i saw like what i don't know
like what the effects are since i've lived
[SPEAKER_02]: in the same place and that's another thing
i actually have not moved my whole like
[SPEAKER_02]: i've moved one time from when i was in
third grade to where i am now and i
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't moved and i've grown bud here my
whole life so like that's the reason why
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like i i'm pretty good at growing
where i live you know and um especially
[SPEAKER_02]: you take care of your shit yeah yep and um
noticed i've noticed since i've been doing
[SPEAKER_02]: um since i've gone the straight organic
route and i've seen life come to my come
[SPEAKER_02]: to my land you know there's more worms in
my bed there's you know there's
[SPEAKER_02]: dragonflies everywhere there's mantis
there's ladybugs everything you know
[SPEAKER_02]: before it wasn't like that like you know
the the soil wasn't as fertile and when
[SPEAKER_02]: you start when you start doing organics
and you start getting better at it you
[SPEAKER_02]: promote life and you promote shit to come
to your shit to work for you you know
[SPEAKER_02]: basically that's awesome dude yeah for
sure so having the knowledge that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: now if you can go back in time and talk to
yourself before you started growing what
[SPEAKER_02]: advice would you give to yourself just go
the living soil route fuck hydro fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: chemicals like dude it's it's funny how my
mindsets change dude like it's so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: funny to think about i i say that to
myself a lot is if i if i knew what i know
[SPEAKER_02]: now but back then you know i wish i could
go back in time and talk to myself don't
[SPEAKER_02]: we all bro don't we all be like don't
spend all your money on food every day or
[SPEAKER_00]: what's upcoming for you are you working on
any projects in the industry or anything
[SPEAKER_02]: like that i do have my geodesic dome so
i'll and you know that's gonna be that's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be dope i'll be able to push out a
good a good portion of uh of organically
[SPEAKER_02]: grown bud every like three to four months
but another thing that i'm doing in
[SPEAKER_02]: massachusetts there's a a large dispensary
that's going there um i i will be growing
[SPEAKER_02]: for the them with my uh with a good friend
of mine and we only need six people to run
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole uh 50 000 square feet so um and
and that's going to be growing with kems
[SPEAKER_02]: but i know i know um i'm confident in my
abilities that that you know that can grow
[SPEAKER_02]: buds gonna be dank you know dude i gotta
turn it out there man that's not that far
[SPEAKER_02]: of a drive yeah for sure yo like um in
massachusetts there's a lot of hurdles you
[SPEAKER_02]: gotta go through you can't grow straight
organics in in in commercially for
[SPEAKER_02]: massachusetts at least uh you got there's
like too many um there's too many uh
[SPEAKER_02]: standards the like the heavy metals um and
and a lot a lot of other things just and
[SPEAKER_02]: also mold and things like that like if you
have a living soil and you have uh
[SPEAKER_02]: mushroom sporulating in your indoor
environment you'll have a you'll have um
[SPEAKER_02]: mutagen on it you know and it'll it'll
it'll spark your uh and it won't pass you
[SPEAKER_02]: know or something like that so i got you
you gotta like grow with water and rock
[SPEAKER_02]: wool and cocoa and all that and then flush
it and then you know that's just the way
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna be for right now well yeah uh
tons of people do it and they succeed and
[SPEAKER_02]: ori ori grown um i i really admire his uh
his way that he's that he's doing his um
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary i'm sure i'm sure oregon has a
high standard as well i'm pretty sure
[SPEAKER_02]: massachusetts has the highest standard in
the whole country which kind of yeah it's
[SPEAKER_02]: uh makes it harder to you know make a
product to put it on the shelf but in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion that's cool because all the all of
the patients will be getting a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: quality product but you know um what he
does is he takes a pro mix just straight
[SPEAKER_02]: you know straight pro mix and uh he uses
dragonfly earth medicine um which is an
[SPEAKER_02]: organic water-soluble nutrient and that's
it so all he uses is uh those two things
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and that's he's not using any
kind of chemical um his byproduct is uh
[SPEAKER_02]: three gallons of uh of of pro mix you know
which he piles up you know hundreds of
[SPEAKER_02]: those three gallons and piles them up and
then uses it for outdoor organic use you
[SPEAKER_02]: know instead of using rock wool which
takes like 4 000 years to decompose and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's glass and you know and i've seen i've
seen his instagram it's just definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: legit i don't i might have even reached
out to him but i don't doubt anyone that
[SPEAKER_02]: grows indoors with kems just because of um
just because of how sterile you need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: and how careful you need to be with indoor
and all you guys i mean mr grow it like
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody who has a youtube channel and or
an instagram that's just sharing their
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge and information like you guys
aren't really getting much out of doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that like you're doing it for the love of
the industry like maybe some maybe some
[SPEAKER_01]: people are making money now but after
they've like grown a bit but like when you
[SPEAKER_01]: start doing that and you don't have any
subscribers or like all these all these
[SPEAKER_01]: people are just doing it to share
information and help the industry and so i
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely like a lot of my shit that i've
learned has definitely come from you know
[SPEAKER_02]: my own trial and error but like i've
definitely talked to the right people and
[SPEAKER_02]: um and instagram has definitely helped me
like tremendously meeting people you know
[SPEAKER_02]: and um seeing and you know coming to this
final consensus of how i grow now like um
[SPEAKER_02]: putting information out there dude it's
not like it's not a secret you know
[SPEAKER_02]: especially with growing this but growing
bud it's not secret and people shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to hide their methods they should
just you know give it to everybody um
[SPEAKER_02]: right which is pretty funny to think about
how uh there's this like colorado colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: grower um he he was like um his company
wanted to like fire him and take his
[SPEAKER_02]: notebook uh and like they never got his
notebook and he just left but it's pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: funny how they you know they think they
need it yeah if they get you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: that that method you know then they don't
need the person for doing it it's funny
[SPEAKER_02]: which is totally wrong yeah totally wrong
dude it's like the captain's steering that
[SPEAKER_00]: ship you know right where can people find
you what what uh shout outs do you have
[SPEAKER_02]: contact me on instagram for now my my uh
my youtube is definitely up and coming i i
[SPEAKER_02]: have i have a homie that's been helping me
film and uh we've compiled a lot of film
[SPEAKER_02]: so we just got to do editing well i think
we're ready to wrap it up man yeah ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to wrap it up thanks a lot for coming on
really appreciate it yeah i really
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate you guys having me all right
have a good one take care thanks again
[SPEAKER_00]: brother take it easy guys if you click the
video on the left that'll take you to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other podcast episodes that we did and the
video on the right is automatically
[SPEAKER_00]: generated by the youtube algorithm until
next time peace you
