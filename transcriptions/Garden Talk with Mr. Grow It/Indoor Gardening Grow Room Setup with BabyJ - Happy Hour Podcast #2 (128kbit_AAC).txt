[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka MrGrowIt, and welcome back to
[SPEAKER_02]: my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: A few months ago, I released a video with
THC Titan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was actually a podcast episode from a
podcast that no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned in that video that I had three
more episodes.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this video, both myself and Chris from
Happy Hydro sit down with Baby J from the
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow 420 Diaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you who don't know Baby J,
she has been uploading grow videos to
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube for over five years now,
and her channel has almost 7,000
[SPEAKER_02]: subscribers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sit down, we talk to her, we find out a
little bit more about how she got into
[SPEAKER_02]: growing, and then we talk in detail about
her grow setup and her grow style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since this was a podcast episode,
there's actually no video.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is audio only.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I apologize for not having any visuals
for you, but this podcast definitely has
[SPEAKER_02]: some good information in it, so I wanted
to repost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know for the last podcast episode
that also didn't have visuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some had mentioned that it was good to
listen to in the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, I will stop rambling now,
and let's just get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, this is the Happy Hydro
podcast, and we're here with Baby J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby J, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, Mr. Growett?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited to be here with you guys
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to interview Baby J on her
grow and her YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll kick off the questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Baby J, I've been watching your channel
for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I think since 2015 or
something like that, you got a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's clear that you're very, very
passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us, how did it all start?
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you get into growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: On my 21st birthday, my friend,
he decided to give me a plant as for a
[SPEAKER_03]: present instead of a normal present.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he was just telling me, he was like,
well, just go ahead and check out YouTube,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it'll teach you everything you need to
know about growing this plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I didn't know anything about the
YouTube world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even know anybody just putting
videos out about growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was back in the day when Mr. Tide and
Enjie Closet first started his channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was crazy how much YouTube has
progressed since then.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got on YouTube and I started
watching all the videos about people
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were so many different ways,
so many different techniques out there to
[SPEAKER_03]: teach you how to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I spent hours and hours and hours every
day watching YouTube, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched YouTube more than I watched my
own television.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I literally watched it for about a few
months before I actually got comfortable
[SPEAKER_03]: with actually posting videos, because I
was watching it and I still had the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wasn't really too comfortable
posting, because I really didn't want
[SPEAKER_03]: people to, I don't know, I didn't really
want to look like I didn't really know
[SPEAKER_03]: what I was talking about before I started
making videos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you have that fear of,
yeah, I don't want to look stupid on
[SPEAKER_03]: camera, or whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it took me a little while, actually,
to post content on my channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was actually growing a few months
prior to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first grow actually didn't really turn
out too well.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's pretty much how I got
started, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you go for inspiration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are like a YouTube channel,
or what's a YouTube grow or something that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can remember that really inspired you
or helps you when you were doing your
[SPEAKER_00]: first grow or when you got started?
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow420Guide, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow420Guide was the guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he was pretty much doing the same
setup that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the only grower that I'd seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I started off with CFLs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was looking at a closet or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was actually a little closet box
because, you know, the little plastic
[SPEAKER_03]: totes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys watch Love Vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, Mr. Grote, if you checked
out Love Vibes channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the beginning, he started off with
these little grow boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you buy the little plastic totes
and, you know, you make a little mini grow
[SPEAKER_03]: box with CFLs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, back in the day,
I was started with CFL.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I watched a lot of videos that were
pertaining towards CFL.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Grow420Guide had an awesome CFL grow on
his channel that I was watching all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Love Vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the little grow box idea from Love
Vibes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made a few little grow boxes,
you know, to start off with or whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: the case may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would say early inspirations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grow420Guide was really the main one
because he was actually growing in the
[SPEAKER_03]: same type of setup that I, you know,
kind of sort of had.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is he still active?
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen videos from him in quite a
while, but even still now, he has a wealth
[SPEAKER_03]: of information on his channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can go back, you know, videos and
videos back and you're still going to find
[SPEAKER_03]: just a wealth of, you know, content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to ask her a couple more
questions about her first girl?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's get into the first girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the nitty gritty of the
first girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it was bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to hear about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was OK, because OK, you guys don't
laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is pretty much newbie mistakes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But OK, when I first started growing,
like I said, I got the plan for my friend
[SPEAKER_03]: and he told me to, you know, you look on
YouTube and blaze, blaze, blaze.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I didn't know that, you know,
you would need nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I was under the impression
that you just get dirt, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you feed it water and, you know,
like any new would, you know, think,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, get water, dirt and it should
grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got some Miracle-Grow soil and
everything was going good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the plant was going,
it was growing, you know, Miracle-Grow
[SPEAKER_03]: has, you know, a little bit of substance
in it now that I, you know, I know really
[SPEAKER_03]: more about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it kept the plant going for a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when the plant actually needed
nutrients and started actually showing
[SPEAKER_03]: deficiencies, you know, I started to
panic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, you know, you know,
second nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, let me go on YouTube and figure out
what the problem is or let me go check
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me go see what the problem is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I found out that I needed
to supplement with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ordered my first nutrient supplement,
which was a general hydroponics floor
[SPEAKER_03]: series.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, on the back of the bottle,
it says, you know, makes per gallon ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm so impatient because as a new
grower, if you're really into the if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're really into growing cannabis,
you're literally in your I'm in there all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking at the plants, I'm you know,
they're not even doing anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just staring at them, hoping that
I can see a difference in them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I got my general hydroponics
and it said on the back of the bottle mix
[SPEAKER_03]: per gallon.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was so impatient thinking that if I
feed them, you know, I had a little water
[SPEAKER_03]: bottle, just a little eight ounce water
bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I swear I mixed up a gallon's worth of
nutrients in that little eight ounce
[SPEAKER_03]: bottle of nutrients and fed it to my plant
and must have fried the whole crap out of
[SPEAKER_03]: my plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Y 'all like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the end of that story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, because after that,
it really I think I actually push it to go
[SPEAKER_03]: mail, honestly, because it started
throwing ball sacks like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have just been a mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, that, you know,
I fried it seriously bad and it turned out
[SPEAKER_03]: to be a mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was kind of down about that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm sure I haven't seen your YouTube
channel, but I'm sure you figured it out
[SPEAKER_00]: since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those mistakes, it's so funny because
a lot of new growers, they make that type
[SPEAKER_03]: of mistake all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, you think that if you feed
it more, you're going to get more results.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's never ever the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I would teach less is really
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of growers can tell you that
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the current grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your setup is has expanded quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have like a multiple tent set
up now, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about tell us about your
current grow setup that you have going.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now in the main flower room,
I have a Spectrum King and two Mars Hydro
[SPEAKER_03]: 600 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: All LED lights or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are all LED right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, I'm using majority all LED.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't experimented with any,
you know, intent, you know, HIDs or
[SPEAKER_03]: anything like that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, you know, a lot of heating
issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to dial my temperature
and everything in because even with the
[SPEAKER_03]: LEDs, I'm still experiencing, you know,
the spike in temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I have all LEDs I have in the
veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have my T5.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 240 watt T5 as well as I'm still
using some supplemental CFL lighting as
[SPEAKER_03]: well for veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have and that's all in the
tent, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the CFLs in the tent and then a
Mars Hydro 300 in the tent as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I have a breeding tent that's
actually using the micro LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys heard about micro
LED, but a nice little 100 watt unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect for breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect for, you know, a smaller two by
four grow, especially because I have two
[SPEAKER_03]: of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're making your own strains then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I'm experimenting with a
little breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing too serious because, you know,
I I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to say because you know
how like people get so uptight about
[SPEAKER_03]: being, you know, pollen chucking and
whatever the case may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, fill them in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's pollen chucking?
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, it's just when you just throw
whatever you can together.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really, you know, true breeding,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a smorgasbord of pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like a true just one to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, and it's a lot of
controversy behind that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a lot of breeders can tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like when you you said you're
having heat problems when you like walk
[SPEAKER_00]: into your room, do you have all of these
tents in one like bedroom or is it do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an air conditioner in there or they
spread out throughout or?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the way my room is set up, it's it's
it's actually pretty you probably wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: even think it would be like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have where I have the main fly room,
it's a huge I'm talking about huge walk in
[SPEAKER_03]: closet like it's pretty much a whole
nother room in itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then that's the main flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you get can you get air
conditioning in there or anything or like
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have I have I have air conditioning in
my main in my main room, which is actually
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like it's like in the dead center.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like the epicenter of my
whole setup.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have AC in the main room,
which actually, you know, supplies the
[SPEAKER_03]: basement where the bedroom is as well as
the main flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the only problem I'm having is because
I think I need to get a higher BTU AC
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's not really, you know,
it has that little it's like a five
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand BTU, but it has to cover,
you know, the basement as well as the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of it's not it's not enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, five thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they get like a normal window unit
is usually like ten thousand BTU.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does anyone know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a smaller unit now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been meaning to upgrade the AC
unit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually thinking about going ten
ten thousand BTUs and up because this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a window unit or.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a window unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know some people use a standing
air conditioners and I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard mixed reviews about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I know there's two different
versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: One version actually releases smelly air
through the exhaust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's another version that
actually pulls air from the outside and
[SPEAKER_00]: then uses that and then sends that same
air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it like doesn't release smelly air.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, of course, those ones I would
be able to get with some what's one of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, pocketed funds and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are like super expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are more expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if they're even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just saying, I've just heard of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're better at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know window units are pretty reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, they're pretty reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing about it is, too,
because I have central I have central,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, air conditioner in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have it's like I have that going as
well as the window unit just to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: combat to kind of even it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now, since it's so
expensive, so hot right now, and I'm in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, you know, my flower room is
getting with all the LEDs on and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Eighty two to eighty six.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the highest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's kind of a little, you know,
I'm used to floating like the seventy nine
[SPEAKER_03]: is range, you know, and that's and that's,
you know, in winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's kind of touching it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's touching it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though for LEDs, though, because I
mean, most manufacturers recommend you run
[SPEAKER_02]: high to higher temperatures like Spectrum
King.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Spectrum King, Brandon over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: He recommended me to run up to eighty
seven degrees, which I thought was kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's the point of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: He had mentioned that, you know,
in some places, weed grows naturally at
[SPEAKER_02]: this temperature and high humidity so it
can survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually more happier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And VPT Charles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the high humidity kind of helps it
out, like in the 60 percentile range kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of helps out with the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my thing is with the heat problem,
I'm kind of paranoid about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew and everything,
because I've had a bad experience with
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's with me picking up clones from
the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why, man, you got to be safe with
where you're getting clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to make sure you're on top of that
quarantine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because I brought the clone home and
it just was, you know, I didn't know it
[SPEAKER_03]: was infected with powdery mildew until it
hit flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what pissed me off so much about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about the quarantine situation a
little bit more like get the clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring them in, put them in a little tent
by themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, put them somewhere away from your
main stuff you got going, at least for a
[SPEAKER_03]: few weeks, because I mean, whatever that
clone brings in, you're going to infest
[SPEAKER_03]: your garden with, you know, you got to
kind of think about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say quarantine it away from
your other plants and just like make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: you keep up on like, you know,
your IPMs and making sure, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the maintenance is on point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what if it's in a clone dome,
one of those small clone domes in like the
[SPEAKER_02]: corner of your tent, for example,
is that segregated enough or would you
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend more than that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, me, I like, you know, I'm air of
caution, you know, as being a grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you go through a lot of,
yeah, you go through a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wouldn't want, you know,
you get a clone and the next thing you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, it's infested with mites or
something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, your whole freaking
garden has mites now because, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like CO2 tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, if you're using CO2 tanks and
you're exchanging them at the grow store,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they are, they're, they're just
mites, powdery mildew, anything that was
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden that that CO2 tank was in
before is going to be on that tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, grow stores aren't infested with bugs
and mildew and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I worked at one for three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm well aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to tell people before you put that
CO2 tank in your grow room, you better
[SPEAKER_00]: bleach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, if ideally keep it outside
of the room, do you use CO2?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I do not use CO2 right now because
I'm, you know, my whole theory is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the AC is actually bringing in a
lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since I'm actually in the room,
I, you know, I'm breathing and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, it's probably not enough CO2,
but I, you know, I'm, I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable with, you know, not actually
having a supplement with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, you know, maybe it might help the
girl if I do, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, right now I'm not really too big
on me to getting CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was just going to say a basement
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're, um, if you're growing in
the basement, I mean, CO2 is heavier than
[SPEAKER_00]: air naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a bunch of people living in the
house, CO2 is probably levels are probably
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be higher down there,
I would assume from it's sinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have a gang of people,
you know, that stay in the house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in a pretty big house.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I, I'm very confident about
the CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, I don't feel like I have to get
external CO2 right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, although I think it may benefit,
benefit the grow a little bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause you know, CO2 is really beneficial,
but.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to just go through what we
have here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower room, led lights, veg tent,
CFLs, T5s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say you, so there's led in there
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there is, there's one Mars Hydro 300
watt unit that's still in the tent just to
[SPEAKER_03]: give it that, you know, that mixed
spectrum kind of sort of, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, everything is right now still in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I just harvested, um, I'm still
getting, you know, flowers trimmed up and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now I still just have plants in
the veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: The flower room is kind of out of
commission for right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you go through your harvest
period and you got to reset, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a whole process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean the room for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you growing hydro soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Coco was bring, bring me into that
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me a little bit about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing in pro mix HP.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess it is a soil, soil medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any food in it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to feed it all the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to supplement all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the things I like about
the pro mix brand is just, I like the,
[SPEAKER_03]: the controllability you have and you know,
you get to control it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like I said, Miracle Grow has shit
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, you know, let's say you,
you got the Miracle Grow soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't really just go and dump
nutrients in it right now because it
[SPEAKER_03]: already, you're going to burn your plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It already has stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to say pro mix has beneficial
bacteria in it, mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using the one with the mycorrhizae in
it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really beneficial for roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you like, are you using plastic
pots or fabric pots?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using plastic right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a, I have a couple of fabric pots
outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little outdoor project that I'm
doing that's in fabric pots, but indoors I
[SPEAKER_03]: use mostly plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're not mixing anything with the
pro mix, just using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you put like clay pebbles in the bottom
of the pot or anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was actually thinking about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: To kind of help as far as like with
drainage and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, drainage and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was thinking more so like,
you know, cause I'm going to try to Scrog
[SPEAKER_03]: this next round and flushing is my main,
that's been my main thing about the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_03]: I killed it last, you know, last round
with the Scrog, everything went well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was thinking that if I was to layer
the bottoms of the pots with, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least some clay pebbles or something,
it would kind of help get all the,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the excess salts out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get, you get what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: To kind of not have the plant just sitting
in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because like I said, with the Scrog,
you kind of can't move it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just told me you're still killing it
without the clay pebbles though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but you know, I'm really anal about
the flushing thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to make sure that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted the listeners to,
to know and hear that like, even if you
[SPEAKER_00]: forget to put your clay pebbles in,
as long as you are careful and do all your
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube homework, you can still come out
with a good grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people think that you have to
have a lot of expensive equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't start my channel off with
expensive equipment at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, of course, you know,
I got YouTube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got LEDs, you know, later on,
but I didn't just start, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't start off with expensive
equipment to start my grow or my channel.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can grow without all of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so do you put your plants just like on
the ground in saucers or do you have like
[SPEAKER_00]: a big tray or something?
[SPEAKER_03]: In saucers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have them all in saucers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking I wanted to actually get an
actual big tray for there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't have to actually carry them
around all in saucers and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just kind of coagulate in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so can you tell me like what size pots
you use, how many plants and like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do your roots look like when you pull
them out at the end?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like filling up your whole pot?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a problem that I've been
noticing as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using five gallon tall pots for my
main flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: For veg, everything is in a two gallon
right now, except the, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the little babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you transplant?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a little unorthodox with
transplanting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep my plants in these small containers
for a little bit longer than I should.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not even going to lie to you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when it's one person taking care
of like 20 plants or something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and then I, you know,
I'm working on everything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of, you know, drag on the
transplant a little bit, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you hand watering then?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now I'm hand watering.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little watering wand that I,
you know, put into a little bucket and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one more, one more question before I
let Mr. Grow It take over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of nutrients are you using now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was last round using the Raymo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, I've been every round I've been
changed, switching nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that's not really, not really a
good idea for a lot of new growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to tell anybody to do that,
but I'm still trying to find my niche.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to find what I can dial
in and what I can use.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be, you know, convenient,
more easier for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as, you know, I have, I have,
I have people send me nutrients all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really just want to find a simpler
way to supplement my plants and not have
[SPEAKER_03]: to use so many bottles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you PA, well, Raymo, before I ask this
question, how many bottles does Raymo
[SPEAKER_00]: have?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know much about them,
but I want to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's about seven bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it's like advanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't use all seven though.
[SPEAKER_03]: You use about four in veg and then you use
about five in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you have to adjust your pH and you
have a PPM meter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very important things that every
grower should have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of meters do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm using, what is the name of my pH pen?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an expensive one or is it just
like.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was about 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing about it is I had one of the
cheap, I had the cheap Chinese ones and
[SPEAKER_03]: they work good, but I don't know,
for some reason mine's died out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just had, I was like, I'm not going
to keep buying, you know, spending $40 for
[SPEAKER_03]: a pH pen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just go ahead and buy the,
you know, the $80 digital one should be
[SPEAKER_03]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The brand of a pH pen I have is an eco
tester.
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eco.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm familiar with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just used to sell a bunch of them at
the grow shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're waterproof, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're checking pH and PPM,
you're doing, are you doing pre feed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing runoff or are you doing
both?
[SPEAKER_02]: Both, both.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very important to do both because
I've had pH issues in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I like to know what's going on
in my soil as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as well as when I'm
supplementing and giving them the food
[SPEAKER_03]: before, if that makes any sense.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what, what using ProMix, what pH range
do you like to stay in?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then throughout like, you know,
growing, what PPMs do you try to keep your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants in?
[SPEAKER_03]: pH wise, I like to say 6-2 in ProMix.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plants do really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, like I, if I keep it at 6-2,
I don't have to worry about lockout
[SPEAKER_03]: issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, depending, I remember I had a really
bad pH wing, the nutrients that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: using, whatever you're supplementing your
plants, you know, like Floranova,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys are familiar with
that Floranova series.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a thick organic, semi-organic,
whatever the hell you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: from pH.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That thing will cause some major like
soil, soil pH swings for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to make sure you flush your,
your, like, if you're going to use that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to flush regularly, like
literally, because you will get some major
[SPEAKER_03]: pH swings with that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like you lived it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really glad you're sharing that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually thinking about trying out
that line of nutrients and it's good to
[SPEAKER_02]: hear that, you know, tips like that,
I think is helpful for, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: people that currently use the nutrients or
are looking to use the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know a lot of people that have had very
good success with Floranova.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, I think it's a very good
nutrient because when I was using it,
[SPEAKER_03]: the plants, like when I immediately fed
it, like especially to grow, it
[SPEAKER_03]: immediately gave, like, I love the fact
that it's just a one bottle, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: base.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't have to give it
anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Literally, you can just feed it that and
your plant's getting everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever just grown fully organically
or like it, like the way that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing right now, has this kind of been
the way that you've always grown or have
[SPEAKER_00]: you ever tried hydroponics or anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to try hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, the way that I've been growing
right now, I'm comfortable with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like, like the medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have cocoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought cocoa a couple of weeks ago
because I want to start experimenting with
[SPEAKER_03]: cocoa because I think that would be the
kind of, it'll kind of be, because you
[SPEAKER_03]: know how it's a soilless medium,
you can run it in hydro and it can work
[SPEAKER_03]: very well with a hydro system.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I'm so comfortable with soil,
I think cocoa would be a really good
[SPEAKER_03]: transition into hydro, if you get what I'm
saying, because I'm so familiar with the
[SPEAKER_03]: soil base.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, it's kind of similar,
just in the hydro setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, you can overwater in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you transplant a plant into
Coca-Cola and then you don't let the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: establish themselves and then start
hammering it with water, you definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: can overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once those roots are established in
cocoa core, you can hook up a drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can water, you can just really,
you can water the shit out of them and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have good drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good drainage is always key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really key.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about your ventilation system?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we talk about that yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what are you using for like an inline
fan, ducting out of the room?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember if you said that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then do you have like a lot of air
circulation going on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I have a shit ton of air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as with inline and out,
I do not need, right now I don't need it
[SPEAKER_03]: because the way everything is,
like I said, my room, the flower room is
[SPEAKER_03]: an open closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a huge room.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I shade it off with, you know,
for the dark period, I shade it off with a
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic sheeting over the, you know,
over the door, yeah, over the doorway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and at the top there is, there's a
little, I'm not going to say a little
[SPEAKER_03]: section.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a section where air, it blows,
blows.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even need a ventilation system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty much what I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a lot of fans?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I have a whole ton of fans going on
through this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as I'm sitting here right now,
I can feel the wind just.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what, what do you think your like
biggest catastrophe was or your biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: failure growing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would have to say my biggest,
biggest fail with grow would have to been
[SPEAKER_03]: that powdery mildew incident, but it
didn't even collapse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It might grow too much because I mean,
I still ended up harvesting the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just did it though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jose, um, Cervantes way, you know how he,
you know, washes the buds after harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything with the peroxide bath and
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it that way and it kind of just
washed the mildew away.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what does he do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I have no idea what that is.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, he washes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and he has a video on it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: He, for to get rid of powdery mildew on
your buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, he takes the bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, after harvest, he cuts it off
and he, he has some water.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a bath mixed up with some,
uh, hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like, uh, one teaspoon per
like five gallons of like hydrogen
[SPEAKER_03]: peroxide, you know, hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, he just washes the buds and
you can see the powdery mildew flow all
[SPEAKER_03]: over the top of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen this Mr. Groot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You, you gotta watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's definitely a controversial
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some people are so against bud
washing, but I mean, yeah, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: scary seeing him submerge an entire branch
all the way under water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty gross.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shit ton of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydrogen peroxide washed buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really think about it, like super
sanitizing your bud, but you just have to
[SPEAKER_03]: make sure you get all that excess water
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to have rot or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how he did it was he had a fan,
he had him hanging up after he washed him
[SPEAKER_03]: and bathed him and everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: He rinsed them down and then he had him
hanging on this little rack and he just
[SPEAKER_03]: had the fan blowing on him just to make
sure you got all that excess moisture out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know, you don't want that in
your bud and everything, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did that with mine and it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ended up having a pretty cool harvest,
but I mean, you know, is this something
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, it's not nothing you want
to, you know, have in the back of your
[SPEAKER_03]: mind that you have powdery mildew on your
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have that smoking mildew,
you know, I'd rather wash that shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: some hydrogen peroxide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you, that's crazy,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to watch that video.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I've watched people cut down like
crops because they don't want to deal with
[SPEAKER_03]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've met.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have dunked that shit in a
bucket of water and kept it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but you know, you got to think
about the labor for that too, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got about what, a hundred plants with
PM, you know, you've got to dump all
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when that much shit's on the line,
you got to get creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do, you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a very creative way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you, I mean, you can literally see
the powdery mildew like just off the bud
[SPEAKER_03]: floating on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Baby J, we want to ask you another
question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your biggest yield to date and how
much, how much wattage were you using?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so proud of this, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, I had to say, this is really my
proudest moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause this is when you really found your
niche in growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, when you get that, when you get
that satisfied feeling like, yes,
[SPEAKER_03]: I finally got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's my season.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys go back for anybody watching
this podcast, it's my spectrum King Mars
[SPEAKER_03]: Hydro combo.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's the name of the actual
cycle that I named it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I first got the setup when I
had just got the spectrum King put in
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had my 600 watt, both 600 watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 880 something watts pumping in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had my gorilla smash from Canada
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what, you know, it's gorilla is
gorilla glue crossed with, is it lucky
[SPEAKER_03]: charms or I got to get back to y'all on
that, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just, I gotta get back to y'all
on that, but yeah, it's the name of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strain, but it's, it's from Canada
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what genetics test for awesome
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But oh my God, you guys, I yielded
literally over a pound for plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: General general hydro floor series.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my little simple, I'm trying to tell
you guys fair, very simple nutrient
[SPEAKER_03]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_03]: All I had was the LED, you know,
both LEDs in there for strength for plants
[SPEAKER_03]: of the gorilla smash over a pound in my
little, in my little grow area.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys now, if you have to check it out,
you have to watch it for you to really
[SPEAKER_03]: see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my gosh, that was perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't have any problems on that grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything went as smooth as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran it nine weeks straight, harvested at
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything was just perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect flush everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your, and um, you're like for
drying your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, you know, like, do you use a
dehumidifier or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's your, what's your drying
situation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, so I dry in my actual room and my,
because I have the AC in here,
[SPEAKER_03]: it kind of keeps the room really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the room is actually cooler than the
actual flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if it's 82 in the room in the flower
room, it's about, 72, it's like 10
[SPEAKER_03]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a diff, it's a difference for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally, you can walk out the
flower room and feel the difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, with me having the lights off and
everything, once I harvest, I like to give
[SPEAKER_03]: myself two weeks before I actually reset
the flower room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within that two weeks, I have
everything drying and it's like a 60,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like a 69 ish, 69 degrees,
uh, about 50, 52 degrees humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, 50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I like to dry around there and I keep
it about seven to 10 days depending
[SPEAKER_03]: on if I have some fat ass, but like some
fat buds, I'll keep it a little longer
[SPEAKER_03]: just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, that's pretty much the baby
J to dry method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're still, you're, are you still
rolling the same wattage in your flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room as you were when you got this yield?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just, and you just had a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to maybe update us on,
or, you know, on your yield from this
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think it's going to be bigger or good
too?
[SPEAKER_03]: If anything, it's going to be about the
same, um, because I had two plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: there, it's actually the phenol two of the
same strain that I got a pound off of,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um, it's the, because of the phenol,
it's not as, it's heavy yielding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not going to get, you know,
it's heavy yielding properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why, that's one of the reasons why
I didn't keep that phenol.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, I should pull pretty close too,
because the mayhem bears, which is another
[SPEAKER_03]: strain from Candida genetics is,
I mean, the buds, I mean, Mr. Grow,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you, you, you seen these buds are
freaking huge, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen some of your, uh, some of your
recent videos, like I said, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, it's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you guys haven't seen, uh, baby J's
garden, you got to go over to her channel
[SPEAKER_02]: and check it out because she's really,
really growing some really nice,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we got one more question for you,
Mr. Grow it, um, the loaded question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will usually ask this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so listen to this one, knowing what
you know now, if you can go back in time
[SPEAKER_02]: and talk to yourself right before you
started your first grow, what advice would
[SPEAKER_02]: you give yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: Simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not mix a gallon's worth of nutrients
in a little mini bottle.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is the worst mistake you could ever
make because it was like immediate,
[SPEAKER_03]: like it was immediate damage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like literally the plants started wilting
immediately when it got the feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish that would have been on video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I admit you guys, I kind of wish I didn't
because I'm one of those, I like to show
[SPEAKER_03]: my mistakes just so people know that I'm
not, you know, I, you know, I have
[SPEAKER_03]: mistakes still too, you know, with
growing, growing to have, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: run into mistakes all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to document everything and I
really wish I was more comfortable back
[SPEAKER_03]: then to be able to document that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that was some, it was funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was really funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every time I talk, tell people about that,
they just crack up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be sweet to watch like a
time-lapse video and fast forward of like
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant reacting to being overfed or
underwater or like stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I would, I would say,
you know, makes my ratios, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed to get better with mixing my
ratios for the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say get my, I would, I should have
got my AC unit sooner because I was
[SPEAKER_03]: running into heat issues with my CFLs
because like once it gets hot,
[SPEAKER_03]: it gets hot and the humidity was high and
I started getting fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm, you know, I still get fungus gnats
till this day, but I got a really bad
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus gnats infestation on my season
three.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say get my temperature and
everything under control, have better air
[SPEAKER_03]: circulation because if I would have had
better air circulation in that flower
[SPEAKER_03]: room, I would probably wouldn't have had
as bad of a fungus gnats infestation as I
[SPEAKER_03]: did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So baby J, what, um, do you have anything
like upcoming?
