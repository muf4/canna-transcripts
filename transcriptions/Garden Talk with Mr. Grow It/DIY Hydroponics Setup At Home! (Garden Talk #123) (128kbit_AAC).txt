[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Mr. Nice Guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going, Chris?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you happen to get your name from that
1997 Jackie Chan movie, Mr. Nice Guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: where the Chinese chef accidentally gets
involved with a news reporter who filmed a
[SPEAKER_01]: drug bust that went airy and is now being
chased by gangs who are trying to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: videotape?
[SPEAKER_01]: Read that plot right then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty close on the genre, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was in the 90s, but I don't
know if you've seen Half Baked,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the delivery service was Mr. Nice Guy
Deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of stole it off them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where you got it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for coming onto the podcast
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to talk all about hydroponics,
which is really your bread and butter,
[SPEAKER_01]: DIY.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of experience there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you first tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, my background isn't too,
let's say, focused on horticulture or
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rather, it is DIY and I learn and do a lot
of research between what I know and how I
[SPEAKER_00]: can apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of my experience from work,
not to mention I grew up at a young age
[SPEAKER_00]: working construction, spa framing,
a lot of different physical kind of jobs
[SPEAKER_00]: growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used that to apply it to now I'm
gardening and fixing my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up here in Cali, Southern
California, so you can imagine the weather
[SPEAKER_00]: is not too crazy, but it does kind of
shift up and down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I mentioned, a lot of my DIY
goes into my experience through life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been working on cars,
computers, electronics ever since I was a
[SPEAKER_00]: little kid, kind of mentioning and
applying that where I need it and where it
[SPEAKER_00]: can be used most efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look up to growers like yourself on
YouTube ever since I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Canuck, I don't know if you watch
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we love Mr. Bugby, if anything,
kind of on my feet on a daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm an everyday learner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could apply it to what I love as a
hobby or as a grower or gardener,
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to be the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to gardening, I guess I
really started gardening when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased my home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a few years ago with my wife and
we have a lot of backyards basically to do
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have avocados, we even try growing
watermelons, potatoes, assortment of
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes, if you want to call that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids love doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My daughter loves picking those and
growing them herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a mandarin tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to grow a lemon tree so I can
have the necessity, you know, area,
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's backyard, a kind of dream for
that same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have my seasonal medicinal
plants outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, it's kind of derivative
of my indoor stuff that I have and I push
[SPEAKER_00]: it out there when the season's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now what would you say is your overall
style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoor, outdoor, organics,
synthetics, soil, cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would imagine my style of gardening
would pertain mostly to indoor hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: where I use different methods of growing
for different growth stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use cocoa, rock wool, hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also use synthetic blends, especially
since it's a hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have too many things and build
up algae or film and causing the flow to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop going one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work a lot with a recirculating system
so I need the flow to be constant and
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to maintain a perpetual grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have two different tents indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like my seedlings, my cuts,
my fresh cuts I have on one side and when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're rooted enough and big enough to
move it to the to my bigger tent or my
[SPEAKER_00]: next tent over and I have my end stages of
like vegetation and flowering at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: there at least and repeat the process that
I take cuts that I need and get tired of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of go on the search for another
mother.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mostly hydroponics indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly what we're talking about
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you like to get into the DIY
side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You built your own DWC system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's break it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's break it down a little bit for the
beginners first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might not know what DWC is or
also are DWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain what both of those things
are?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, DWC or deep water culture is more or
less a form of hydroponics similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: like, I don't know if you're, I know
you're familiar with the Kratky method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple thing is like having a jar and
roots are hanging into the water and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of depletes the nutrients as it
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep water culture is more passive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or less passive for that same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: It requires that you implicate oxygen so
it can add to the roots for that same
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's kind of the
difference between over watering your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and under watering them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely difficult to do so within
deep water culture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a nutshell, the plant is suspended in a
neutral like medium with its roots mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out in the container to take the
nutrient water up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time you have,
like I mentioned, some oxygen being
[SPEAKER_00]: aerated up from maybe like an air stone or
depending on how big you have your setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to draw some micro bubbles up there
and keep the oxygen going and keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant healthy and keeping it some air to
breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then different to maybe a RDWC or
recirculating deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my, let's say situation, I have like a
kind of three plant setup where I have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the buckets kind of interconnected with
PVC tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll give it a nice flow between all
the same water flowing between the three
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll make it so I don't have to refill
or maintain individually those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: those same plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like, you know, when you're
doing like a deep water culture or like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something that's all connected,
you want to kind of keep to the same kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like plant or cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so it doesn't get too, they're not
too different in growth rate or like
[SPEAKER_00]: things you have to kind of like,
let's say, maybe manipulate the different
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients that you have for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some plants like, they're very
temperamental, you know this, and
[SPEAKER_00]: depending where they come from,
they have different, let's say,
[SPEAKER_00]: means to uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for the most part, the two biggest
differences between the deep water culture
[SPEAKER_00]: and recirculating is the passing of the
water between the tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be anywhere from, you know,
simple like vinyl tubing, or you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've seen setups where they have
anywhere from inch stick to pipes to like
[SPEAKER_00]: three inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go anywhere from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, it's not the biggest
difference if you have a smaller setup,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the higher flow would be kind of,
it will circulate a lot of the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep it like not idle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't be sitting there and kind of like
building a film or anything of this sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the case with like deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the water is like fluctuating a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so arguably our DWC is a little bit
easier for the regions you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reservoir and things of
recirculating through multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really just have that one control
versus DWC kind of like individual
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to fill up individual buckets
and manage the nutrients for each
[SPEAKER_01]: individual plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you mentioned, it has a downsize
for recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got all different cultivars in
there and they have kind of different
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient uptake, it can be finicky,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have some plants that are
perfectly healthy and others that are
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's definitely some pros and
cons to both of those methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty cool that you do the
RDWC method and that you actually built
[SPEAKER_01]: your own setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the DIY
hydroponic recirculating system that you
[SPEAKER_01]: set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for my setups, for the most part,
I like to have a basis before I build so I
[SPEAKER_00]: can have some expectations at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it does pertain to budget and the
space I have to work with, and more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less trying to maximize the usages of what
I have already and what I need to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: With my 2x4 design, I designed,
like you mentioned, a three-plant RDWC
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also kind of implicated a wire waterfall
to get the top roots cut with some
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of like the idea of a
bubble-ponics kind of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a waterfall and it gives some
nutrients to the top roots so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: expand through the oxygen gap between the
bubbles coming from the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you essentially don't want to feel like
your water is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four-gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I merely fill it up like a third and then
all the moisture hits the roots anyways
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's very little dry-back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basics to some deepwater coasters
require a reservoir, depending on how you
[SPEAKER_00]: go about adding your nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally deleted my reservoir and even
my chiller for more space within my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But depending on your situation,
I know it's kind of humid where you stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water temperatures might be kind of up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can imagine using your chiller would
be more optimal for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I didn't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of pulled it, saved some
electricity and the extra computer tower
[SPEAKER_00]: that sits on the outside of my tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in Cali, I'm pretty good with my
water temps at mid-60s sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the colder the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too cold, but the colder the roots,
the better the uptake for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was mentioning earlier about space
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do a lot of measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure everything does fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with the buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not easy to find for, let's say,
aside from commercial use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to go for a while trying to
find these buckets with their proper lives
[SPEAKER_00]: if they have already come with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Uline.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do sell a lot of commercial materials
for job sites and this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anybody can purchase it regardless of
your status of wholesaler or being in
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I found my buckets at Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sitting on a stack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess they were putting flowers in them
and they were there to take some.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh, can I have these?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use them for a project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, take a few if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essentially trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's some nice black buckets that I
found lids on Uline for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drilled off some holes, added a netting
pot on there to hold my rock wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially the plant that's going to be
growing in there for the rest of its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, my netting pots are anywhere
from eight inches, pretty big ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: sit halfway through the bucket and can be
great expansion for my roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rock wall opens up pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fill the gaps with hydrogen and it does
pretty well with the drainage for that
[SPEAKER_00]: same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the flow, I've gone from tubing,
vinyl tubing to PVC piping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found different outlets on Uline and
even Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that same reason, to build it properly
and make sure everything fits.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same reason, you don't want to
build something like this and not be sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's not going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing in the world is a water
leak midway through your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to flush and redo it all over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dismantle it and find your leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seal it and go for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the nightmare of hydroponics or
deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like filling the bottom of your tent
with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting that vacuum out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned four gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why four gallon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be better with a larger bucket,
smaller?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why four?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on the spacing that you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taller the bucket, I probably wouldn't
mind too much, but the four gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: height is anywhere from a foot and a
quarter up and then they're maybe 10
[SPEAKER_00]: inches wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great fit for giving the space for
the plant to grow upwards and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: take too much space around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have piping and other things like
different fans and maybe a pump for my
[SPEAKER_00]: water within the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less a cleaner area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ever concerned of the roots
filling up that space?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you know plant size to bucket size?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a blessing in a situation like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more roots, everyone wants roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fill your union soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to fill your pot over roots as
much as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, I have my water flowing
through one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: These roots can get clogged within those
pipes.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, that's why people have
bigger pipes so the roots don't clog up
[SPEAKER_00]: and affect the next pot over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a battle in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the bigger roots, but at the same
time, you don't want clogs either because
[SPEAKER_00]: you need that water to flow and not
overflow at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: My drip, it's taken out of one of the same
buckets that's connected.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking water from the bottom and
throwing it on top of each of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to overflow if I have one on
the clog at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining them is definitely a good
idea, keeping an eye on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what size tubing or PVC?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you determine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you're using a four-gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size tubing for the four-gal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it go by number of plants to the size
tubing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that relate at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: With this, my most recent build,
it was availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have definitely went bigger
tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have it at an inch and a
half, almost two inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would definitely have gone to two or
three, but the second part that's needed
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't always available.
[SPEAKER_00]: The knuckle that I thread the PVC into,
I didn't have the other part to go bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than what I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm dealt those cards, so I make the best
of it, if anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope they have a three-inch threaded
knuckle that I can add to my next setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely would go bigger for that same
reason with the roots and the clogging
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: ABS, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's black versus white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take in less lighting and no
build-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no build-up of algae between the
tubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's thick enough, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally haven't come across it with
this tube, but you will with vinyl all
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you're not running a
reservoir, but for those that are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to run a reservoir, how do they determine
what size to use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Reservoir space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, when I did have my reservoir,
it was great to have it to the left of
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever side of my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that reservoir out there,
you're going to have to find a means to
[SPEAKER_00]: run a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't run lines horizontally or at an
angle or anything like this for that
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to have it level to the ground so
the water can flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these tents aren't made with
outlets at the bottom of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're usually have a foot up for ducks
or cables.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to punch them whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have holes through the
bottom of your tent and modify an outlet
[SPEAKER_00]: so you can find a side for your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: As for the size of it, it really depends
on how much you want to suspend for your
[SPEAKER_00]: tanks to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a reservoir and then an automatic
fill.
[SPEAKER_00]: When your reservoir starts losing water,
it starts refilling from the top bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those go anywhere from 10, 15 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you don't have to go inside your
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your refills are much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say maybe your flushing would
probably be more of a pain in clearing out
[SPEAKER_00]: an extra bucket, especially if your grow
is more compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I always look for more efficiency
for my turn and how much more easier it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's the same idea or outcome,
I'm probably going to go for the latter
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then can you talk to us about pump size?
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody's building their own system,
whether it be a four plant system or eight
[SPEAKER_01]: plant system, how do they determine what
pump size and how many air stones to put
[SPEAKER_01]: in each bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, I've always found myself
always going bigger, the better for some
[SPEAKER_00]: things or the better quality and brand for
that same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's definitely a minimum of let's
say, free air pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a three plant system with six inch
flat air stones and I have one commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: pump with outlets running for all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely smaller versions of
them, less loud or more loud for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on your situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: General Hydroponics, they make some simple
pumps with pre-lit outlets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon has several pumps that are really
affordable and they come with outlets too.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, they're not as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just a name really.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all pre-made in the same place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally use a commercial one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's yay big and it's very quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some rubber like feet, so it kind
of vibrations go off the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It runs 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been running it for several years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't spend too much on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's one of those things I was able
to purchase.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think someone had to use a fallout on
Instagram, an offer up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers fall out all the time and they
kind of give up on a hobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come up on some of these products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in California, we have shops that
close down on the regular and turn around
[SPEAKER_00]: and have to sell their materials and
parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's me picking it up on the other end
if I could find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned 8-inch net pots is what you
have within the buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use Rockwell and then Hydroton
surrounding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about using the
Rockwell from start to finish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you start cutting it and then kind of
have it in your seedling area and then
[SPEAKER_01]: switch it over to the bucket?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe Rockwell has gone a long way,
especially with tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a brand Grosdan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of big on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make different versions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone makes Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually use their plugs and their
4-inch cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used bigger ones to experiment,
but it's not really necessary unless
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do a drip-to-drain setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I start with plugs or small little cubes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I insert them into another 4-inch cube as
I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: My seedlings and my fresh cut clones,
I drop them in there and dome them up in
[SPEAKER_00]: my tin and get some humidity to let them
get rooted first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they're rooted and I get stuff poking
out of them, I drop them into another
[SPEAKER_00]: pH-ready 4-inch cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let that sit in there for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: After a couple of weeks, it gets pretty
rooted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it's kind of vegetated to a tin,
more or less, a couple of feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring it over to the next tin over and
get a final couple of weeks of vegetation
[SPEAKER_00]: so the roots can expand and run the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, they go into the
pots and I kind of fill the gaps with the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hydrogen is great for drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, it's more or less
comfortable to a terracotta pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're able to absorb a lot of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, like I mentioned,
the drainage between dipping a pebble lets
[SPEAKER_00]: it flow right through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all right drybacks and then greater
uptake between nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for a nutrient lineup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently, for the last couple of years,
I've been using Athena.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been pretty consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not rocky at all, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: From day one, I haven't really dropped a
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that I put in there,
it works pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: To its word, follow instructions,
the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really wanted to, I've tried
experimenting bumping up ratios,
[SPEAKER_00]: see if it kind of messes with the plan or
if they like it a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to different PPMs between flower
stages and they can go pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you harden your plants well enough,
they'll take a lot of salt for that same
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go by PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't go by EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a numbers guy, so I like seeing the
numbers that break down pretty detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: EC is like two points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really break that down or divide
them into my nutrients that I've mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: into it most recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, I'm thinking of moving over
to their salt mix if I ever expand my op
[SPEAKER_00]: and need more liquid for that same part of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come from other nutrients like psycho.
[SPEAKER_00]: Psycho is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, to be honest, a lot of these
nutrients aren't bad at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them are.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really their ratio and how they
formulate them for these plants to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody knows these plants are
different, so they're going to take up
[SPEAKER_00]: these nutrients differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's up to the grower, the gardener to
kind of fine tune their ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give the plant what they like.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these companies are mentioning,
here, this is yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do with it what you will or you figure
it out, but they want to make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their charts and to a basis,
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make it better, it's really up to the
grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: That puts a lot of variables, conditions,
lighting, and exactly what the plant may
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run Athena and hope that I can keep on
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot of good things about
Athena.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people seem to be jumping over to
Athena and using them just because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: results that you see people getting out of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard a lot of the good things about
ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make it really easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking 500 scale or 700 scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, are you adjusting the PPM that
you're giving to your plants throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the growth cycle so it gets higher as you
go from veg to flour or how do you go
[SPEAKER_01]: about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I go 500 for the scale, if anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: By stage, I try to pay attention to what
the plant is liking, how they react,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they're praying at the time with enough
heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it does fluctuate from vegetation
to flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I find that within flowering,
they're lacking a little bit, I kick down
[SPEAKER_00]: some things so they can pick up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're really liking it, I do add.
[SPEAKER_00]: I add and I add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until I see a lacking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they start showing some bad signs,
a different take away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard other growers go several
thousand in PPM, 3,000 PPM to a point of
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't even imagine that for your
plants and how they can really uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the right setup and your roots
are really clean, if they're big enough
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're able to uptake, they will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finding that plant, finding that mother
that is suitable for such conditions is
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely between my growth cycles,
I try to up as much so they can take as
[SPEAKER_00]: much nutrients for that same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less towards the end, I try to be
more critical and sensitive to seedlings
[SPEAKER_00]: and even teens at some points because I'm
not giving the full effect until they
[SPEAKER_00]: really step into the flowering stage,
especially with their lacking root
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then are you changing nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it every week where there's a new ratio
that you're increasing week by week?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do that change, are you doing any
type of cleaning of the buckets or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with any cleaning solution or are
you just rinsing them out with water and
[SPEAKER_01]: then putting in the next week's nutrient
mix in?
[SPEAKER_00]: With my water, at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use purified water like everyone should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I don't have a purifying
system, which I should.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, every hydroponics person should
have a filtration system, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clean water is necessary, especially if
you're drinking or consuming anything from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My water is between my buckets and more or
less flushing between cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going from vegetation to a
flowering or a fruiting stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that water is going out, being dumped
into my outdoor grows and reused.
[SPEAKER_00]: One way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buckets are then rinsed out with that
same water, thrown into the outside grow
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do full flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's one of the questions,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Towards the end, with the research I've
learned, even Bruce Bugbee, there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: results after the fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're deteriorating doing that even the
three days after that flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of this bro science is going out the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, when I started growing,
I tried to throw that, use all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can imagine that would make my
plant bigger or grow more vigorously.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it wasn't consistent enough for
me to continue to keep on doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, I'm just following directions into
what my nutrient line asks for.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it does require that I flush,
it hasn't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are definitely things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely means to flush aside
from pulling out excess nutrients from
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're changing up from different
cycles, like I mentioned, you definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have a clean start and not have
anything behind that can mix into what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I find that there's something lacking
within my mix, I'll get runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: test the runoff and see how that looks on
my tester, opposed to how it's running
[SPEAKER_00]: within the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This may confuse a lot of people when
they're testing water that's inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: system because the air stone makes pH
levels fluctuate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pull your water out, test the runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't test your stuff in motion because a
lot of it running around is going to mess
[SPEAKER_00]: with your testers and it'll mess you up on
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: From my last question, I raised up my
nutrient levels, my PPM between cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that being said, I don't want to mess
up my numbers that I already put down and
[SPEAKER_00]: add to another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will top off my levels with the same
nutrients as they're running, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: mix different nutrients to fill it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely flushed out and we start
fresh when we go to a new cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you mentioned you use that nutrient
solution on your outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do you get it from a pretty basic
question here, but what do you use to get
[SPEAKER_01]: it from your grow tent that are in the
buckets on the floor of the grow tent?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you get that out into your yard?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using a shop vac or are you using
a pump?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you remove the water from the
buckets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, that was a big question in my
head to transfer a lot of liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got myself some bigger blue
containers to fill the liquid with,
[SPEAKER_00]: but at the same time, yes, I do use a shop
vac, a wet dry vac, and I pull out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another breakdown between the system
and having to pull it out and it rinses
[SPEAKER_00]: out really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rinsing is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really promote the whole rinsing part of
it because if you don't want any clogs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want any leaks, you want to make
sure that you're still consistent to work
[SPEAKER_00]: the next cycle and longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: My drip system, it clogs a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sediment from the salt buildup,
the only way to clear that stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: the lines, is another solution that adds
to your water, which you don't want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to add a solution to clear
lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to also go into your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it out and do it in another time to
keep it running as you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my plants are suspended out of the
water while I'm cleaning, they're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: dried back and they're still wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing happens to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still in their light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining is a big deal, especially with
anything hydroponic, any system that you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to run consistently like a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure that car has gas and
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure your system is clean
and clear of salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buildup does happen and everything is
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wash your dishes for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to wash your pots or your
buckets because they're the same things
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to eat off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about PPM, but we didn't talk
about pH yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about pH a little bit,
like what you typically aim for on a
[SPEAKER_01]: week-to-week basis?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always trying to sit between a six and
a half and at most seven when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: my hydro water flowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always start at a zero PPM when I have
fresh water and it's always tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed in before I drop it all in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I buffer my pH with Athena's Balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that has silica in it will raise
your pH and you can work it out from
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always adding your silica first and
then building up from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're fine-tuning between where you want
to be at on your pH and your PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go pretty light with my seedlings and
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to keep my veg stuff
consistent and expand on root zones and
[SPEAKER_00]: then move it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to my pH, it definitely
needs to be consistent because in my veg
[SPEAKER_00]: tin, everything is pure rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all feed-to-drain, so they're sitting
in trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to pay attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see those guys every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure their drive back is
not too long and they're able to open up
[SPEAKER_00]: their roots for the same part,
like lightings and building too much algae
[SPEAKER_00]: on anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintaining that kind of revolves around
the pH because if something else goes bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: it may fluctuate the pH and then I have to
flush that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's even more difficult when you're
working with rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really flush the rock wool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you sit it over water countless
times and that's a big headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: You almost want to start over again and
just pull it out and drop it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cube, but it's definitely not as easy as
you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the topic of DIY, you also created
a DIY double trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us how you went about
doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually started from one of my first
couple grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bigger tin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of my two by fours, I broke it
down too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of saw an example from Mr. Canuck
when I was watching his videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets really, really tall plants,
but they're always flopping around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if he has a single trellis,
they just flop around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine, why not have a double trellis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Run one and then when it surpasses that
one, run the second one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to have stragglers at
the bottom that you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_00]: move over to the corner or to a point
where you have lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know nowadays there's a lot of side
lights or stuff you can add to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of your tent to add some sun, but not
everyone has that same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to train.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm big on training.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes to positioning your plants or
even kind of bonsaiing them to a point
[SPEAKER_00]: where they lay down on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first grow, I had one plant that filled
the whole five by five tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running a double trellis where I can
get them laying sideways toward the other
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew out big.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was my first grow and I put slightly
less than 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have a little bit left over from
years ago, if anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The trellis is definitely a big help.
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC piping is lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really flexible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it and move around as you
please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be good with your measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Materials aren't too costly when it comes
to things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I built my own, not stacking
two on top of another, it's another cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you notice how much these things cost a
line, you're mostly paying for the
[SPEAKER_00]: shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, I love Gorilla Go tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sell everything nowadays.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like AC Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a kind of one-stop shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla Grow tent is here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to buy a $20 trellis net and it
was another $25 or $30 to ship it over to
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, can I pick it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right here in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, no, we can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my turnaround to go to Home
Depot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was another less five miles and go
build my own with some string.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can go on Amazon, pick up the
trellis net and render over a frame of
[SPEAKER_00]: your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty basic, but it goes without
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really just have to put yourself
forward and want to make these things and
[SPEAKER_00]: not have to wait for shipping or paying
someone else to make it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of pushed it across the board
between a lot of things I do, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing or fixing a car.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can't fix it, if I don't know 100%
sure, I'm not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can, I'm going to attempt without
any loss for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can certainly save a bunch of money
doing it DIY.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's one of the reasons why a
lot of people go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just because they're good with their
hands, but because it's going to save them
[SPEAKER_01]: money as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the PVC double trellis, what size PVC?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're connecting them and they have
what's it called?
[SPEAKER_01]: The elbow pieces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any glue or any sealant or
anything that connects it to, to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: everything locks in place or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you wanted to have like a permanent
fixture, yeah, there's a PVC adhesive that
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for PVC so the plastic can
stick to one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they also have threaded joints that
you can get where you can just screw them
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and then reuse them again later.
[SPEAKER_00]: I prefer more the threaded joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever wanted to break down that same
trellis, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did that same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a big five by five trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I broke down and I made a three by three
trellis to fit a shower girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved it around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to reuse as much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may not have a five by five in there,
but now I have another opportunity to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it for my small three by three.
[SPEAKER_00]: For putting it together, it's really to
your specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find I'm reusing it, don't go the
permanent route.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shoot for threaded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can screw it in and unscrew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find it's something going to be a
staple within that same tin, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go out and get some adhesive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smells that first, but it's not toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to bother your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will set it and you can forget it for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then for the actual thread that is run,
the ones I've seen online with people
[SPEAKER_01]: doing it, they're basically just taking
screws and then putting it into the side
[SPEAKER_01]: of the PVC at a certain spacing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they're using the twine string and
running it up and down, up and down to
[SPEAKER_01]: make squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that pretty much how you do it or
what's your method of that part?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say my mark one, my first
prototype, I definitely did the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: eyelet screws into the PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely is more tedious of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have to make sure your
measurements are on point with how big you
[SPEAKER_00]: want the squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I might double trellis, I did a four
inch square to a six inch square so it can
[SPEAKER_00]: open up between how it expands.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the eyelet screws that you're going
to put in there, you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: play Spider-Man and go end to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one line is loosened, then you're going
to have a floppy area for that same
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that getting the nylon ones on
Amazon, they're just as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to find that zip ties are
going to be your best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes across the board too between
your whole grove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zip ties are a savior.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get that zip tie and just ratchet it on
there between the right net.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can modify the net as big it is and
cut it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things are like seven bucks on
Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: People also use wood for their framing,
like two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to screw it more properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like hanging my trellis from the top of
my tent so I can adjust it as I please.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like it's a lot easier to just
buy the nylon net and then zip tie it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the PVC piping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Save a bunch of time there, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all these DIY projects, whether it be
the hydroponic setup you have or the DIY
[SPEAKER_01]: double trellis, what are some of the
problems that you've come across and how
[SPEAKER_01]: did you resolve them?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've already talked a little bit about
the water leak and clogged pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not sure if you can expand on that at all
or if there's anything else that comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, those are kind of the
biggest nightmares, the leaks and not
[SPEAKER_00]: being around when the leak happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several things that could happen
between a hydroponic setup because you get
[SPEAKER_00]: to a point where you want a lot of things
to be automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to set it and forget it,
walk out of the room and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's still running, you want to
make sure everything's confirmed working.
[SPEAKER_00]: To walk out of the room and then you get a
power outage and then all of a sudden have
[SPEAKER_00]: your pumps aren't going, your rooster is
sitting in the water for this amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time and it's so idle and it just builds
up bacteria that you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a crucial hold down for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come back to a room that's not on
anymore and you have to run a breaker in
[SPEAKER_00]: the back to turn it back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people aren't keen to those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're freaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're calling all their friends and
like, shit, my power's off, how do I turn
[SPEAKER_00]: it back on?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How we're running out of weather
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: California's pretty upset in the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of changes every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm lucky to have the sun out today,
but the last few days it was just raining.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could say that anything that kind of
affects the household or the room kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: affects the environment on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: With things turning off on you or things
not working when you're awake,
[SPEAKER_00]: for me, for that same reason, that's why I
have cameras within my tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep an eye on them 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like I wish I had a camera on
my kid for that same reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a camera on top of her head so I know
what she's doing this whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have to worry so much,
but these are other kids that can fend for
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves and get sick if something
touches them wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely a hobby and put yourself
in the position to be more caring and more
[SPEAKER_00]: observant of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That you want to love and pay attention
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if you get the hydro cake and
eat it too at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That goes across the board with all
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who doesn't like an apple from their own
tree?
[SPEAKER_00]: With these ideas of things walking into
the problems, the things that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: most worry about are things that are out
of your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have things running automatically,
then you can have a slight weight lifted
[SPEAKER_00]: off your shoulder because you know it's
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cameras help a lot because I can pay
attention from a distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially if I can hear things running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all of a sudden I get a notification
that my camera's off or it's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either somebody's robbing me or my stuff
all turned off and I'm going to come back
[SPEAKER_00]: to a quiet room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're awake, it's probably because
you're out doing something or it's at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you come home, it's at the end of the
day and you have to deal with a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the nightmare you don't
want to walk into or expect when having an
[SPEAKER_00]: automated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's supposed to work on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can keep away from all that stuff by
foreseeing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine it before you're doing your build.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not going to have any leaks
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I triple double check my water
sources and make sure that it flows in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right places.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put high pressure on the tubes with a
hose to make sure nothing comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Triple double checking your stuff will
definitely keep you out of the realm of
[SPEAKER_00]: having to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But always that thing in the back of your
head, it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one is safe from mishaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the law of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you're running through soil,
there's always something that could
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise you through pests or lacking
management, weather conditions,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you're not sure that you can
expect when you come back home,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I maybe have a water phobia of
it being everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the fact that there's a lot of
electronics around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like playing with fire eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see how that could be scary for
some people for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the camera thing that you mentioned is
a pretty good idea of listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: camera to see your equipment still sounds
like it's still on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have cameras in my grow yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking to actually put cameras in my
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What brand do you use?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I use these Gling cameras.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not too expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure you can find them like 25
bucks a pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can get some mounts from Amazon
where you can angle them as you please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Within my two two-by-fours, I have them
pointed down and I have a full coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: where I can zoom in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two-way sound, so you can hear the
sound coming back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine if there was somebody else
in your room, you can talk to them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can talk back as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great on surveillance.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be honest, when I first purchased my
house, surveillance was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I covered my house in green cams and I
found these Gling cameras on the way over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, hey, these are inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop them to my tents and now I can watch
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eyes on me, vice versa.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm going to have to get cameras
going to my tent soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about quite a bit here in this
talk today in regards to DIY and
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell the listeners how they can find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything upcoming in the future
that you have going on that you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always catch me on Instagram or
even YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go by highly motivated hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Nice Guy, if anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube and Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anything, I have future girls coming up
trying to find a new mother to move over
[SPEAKER_00]: into their next tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hunt is always the biggest thing
between any kind of garden or between
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever cultivar, but trying to find the
best one and keep moving is kind of the
[SPEAKER_00]: idea right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much tech update, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of settled where I'm at,
but if anything new comes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely going to be on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the most part, I like a lot of the
brands that I'm using, AC Infinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: Gavita.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty great and consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say there's anything that matters
with them, but watch out for my videos and
[SPEAKER_00]: my posts and you can see some updates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I'm going with it and hopefully it
expands and enjoy the videos or the
[SPEAKER_00]: content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to Mr. Nice
Guy's channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below so you guys can
easily navigate to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're listening on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for him,
[SPEAKER_01]: highly motivated hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: His channel should pop right up and then
you'll be able to tune into his content.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Nice Guy, thanks so much for coming on
today and talking about hydroponics and
[SPEAKER_01]: DIY.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely learned a few things myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just getting into DWC, so there's
definitely some things here in this talk
[SPEAKER_01]: that are takeaways for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might actually hit you up with some
additional questions behind the scenes if
[SPEAKER_01]: I have any.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks so much and I hope you enjoy the
rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I'll talk to you back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks a lot, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
