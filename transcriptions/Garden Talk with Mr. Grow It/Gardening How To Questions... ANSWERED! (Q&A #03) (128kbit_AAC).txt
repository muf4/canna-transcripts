[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're watching my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a Q&A video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually been over seven months since
my last Q&A video, so I figured another
[SPEAKER_00]: one is long overdue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been getting a ton of good questions
across both of my YouTube channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I consolidated a list here today to
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the video, I'd like to
give a shout out to our sponsor,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over their new LED grow
light, the SP6500.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have seen my video on the SP3000,
which is a similar design, but there are
[SPEAKER_00]: some differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SP6500 is more powerful, at 650 watts,
and provides a wider coverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3 feet by 5 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has twice as many diodes, and a denser
arrangement, and a higher light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has 2,356 diodes consisting of Samsung
LM301B and Osram 660nm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's full spectrum, it's dimmable,
and it has an efficiency of 2.8 micromoles
[SPEAKER_00]: per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to the Mars Hydro
website down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never grew before, but I read blue can
be bad in stunt growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a lot of blue on the spectrum at
222.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue light does inhibit cell division.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can call this a bad thing,
or you can call it something that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, the way it can be beneficial
is a lot of people who use HID grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: still, they use metal halide as their veg
spectrum, which has a lot of blue in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna result in the plant
having tight node spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what they'll do is they'll switch
to HPS for flowering, which is often
[SPEAKER_00]: referred to as being more beneficial in
bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentions that's a lot of blue on the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually responding to a video where
I show the spectrum of a light and it has
[SPEAKER_00]: a blue spike on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually can't look just at a spectrum
picture and see the amount of blue that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in it, so it can be a little bit
deceiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: 15-20% blue in the spectrum is okay,
as low as 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anything higher than that is said to
not really be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that extra light should be put into
red instead for flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that that I just mentioned,
I learned from Dan from the Green Sunshine
[SPEAKER_00]: Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did a video with him a few
years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Watch This Before Buying an
LED Grow Light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually my main channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will link it down in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ask a ton of different questions in
regards to lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you haven't watched that yet,
I highly recommend you watch it because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of good information in
regards to lighting in that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you defoliate an autoflower?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you ask 10 different people this
question, you'll probably get 10 different
[SPEAKER_00]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what I personally do when it
comes to defoliation for autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll personally wait all the way up until
the plant has just about stopped the
[SPEAKER_00]: stretching phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I'll go through and I'll defoliate
once.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll pluck off leaves towards the middle
of the canopy where airflow might be
[SPEAKER_00]: lacking a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll also pluck leaves down so light
can get down into that canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really all I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually do just a light defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does defoliating midflower cause plants to
grow smaller or bigger buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard both.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how much you defoliate
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take off too much and that will
stunt the growth and provide smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you take off the right amount,
it can certainly provide bigger buds
[SPEAKER_00]: because the light's able to get down into
that canopy and penetrate better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just take my word for it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are plenty of resources across the
internet that tell you simply similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: what I just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been a ton of home-grow
experiments where people have defoliated
[SPEAKER_00]: some plants and next to them same
phenotype from clone have not defoliated
[SPEAKER_00]: and showed yield difference and yield
difference was proven to be more effective
[SPEAKER_00]: in the plants that were defoliated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if any peer-reviewed studies
exist on that or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody knows of any, please link them
down in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I just want to echo what I just
said is always look beyond what you hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these videos, I don't know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never claimed to know everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just speak from my experience
what I've done in the past and what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: encountered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next Q&A, can you go into drying and
curing in containers?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often to burp and what temp during the
curing process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are several different methods to
drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll start with drying first,
then I'll go into curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drying, I've changed my ways over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to start at 50% humidity for drying
phase and then now I'm gone up to 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've done 50%, 55%, and 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like the higher humidity around 60%
better than the 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural humidity here is around 30%,
sometimes even lower than that,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I found whenever I'm running a 50%
humidity when drying, it's actually dried
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit too quickly for my liking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over the past year, two years,
I've been doing around 60% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when it comes to temperature,
around room temperature is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine to 70 degrees Fahrenheit,
75 degrees Fahrenheit is going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lower than that would be okay as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people that do that the
60-60 method, 60% RH, 60 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they swear by that method say that's
the best way they've ever dried a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's come out perfect for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lowest I've personally gone is 65
degrees Fahrenheit and definitely got a
[SPEAKER_00]: good result doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically like to aim for a seven to 10
day dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the plants are dry, I put them into
jars for curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I also put a hygrometer in the jar so
I can monitor the humidity in the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's too high, you're at risk for mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely don't want to have multi-puds,
especially when you've gone several months
[SPEAKER_00]: growing the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvesting, drying, then all of a sudden
you get mold and the curing process is
[SPEAKER_00]: just a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a little hygrometer in the jar
will be beneficial so you can monitor what
[SPEAKER_00]: the RH is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I typically will burp the jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll continue to burp the jars several
times throughout the day until it
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilizes about 62% RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if I first put it into the jars and
it's over 65% RH or 70% RH or higher than
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I always take it out of the jars,
lay them flat down because that's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant risk for mold at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely having the buds dry for a
little bit longer than that is definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial rather than leaving them in the
jars and potentially getting mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, once it's stable at about 62%
RH, I usually burp once a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: once every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long-term storage, just once a month I'll
burp and yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do use the humidity packs,
Boveda humidity packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Integra Boost also has a humidity pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to use those when the
humidity drops a little bit below that 62%
[SPEAKER_00]: RH.
[SPEAKER_00]: I slap a humidity pack in there to
rehydrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if my buds have overdried all the way
to the point where it's like 50% RH,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting those humidity packs in there
isn't going to boost it all the way up to
[SPEAKER_00]: 62%, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully you don't overdry your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer the ES300 or Grower's
Choice?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's talking about the Grower's
Choice ROI E680 that I was running before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So comparing the ES300 with the ROI E680
is kind of comparing apples to oranges in
[SPEAKER_00]: a sense because they have different
flowering coverage areas, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Grower's Choice ROI E680 has,
I think it's a four foot by four foot or
[SPEAKER_00]: five foot by five foot flowering coverage
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ES300 has a two foot by four foot or
two and a half foot by five foot coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to put two ES300s in a four
foot by four foot grow space, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be a little bit more fair of a
comparison, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they have the same coverage area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ran both of those grow lights in the
past.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ROI E680 I actually no longer have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loved it though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really did like the results I got off of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did two grows with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ES300s are still in my garden to this
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are two main reasons why I kept the
ES300s in my garden versus the ROI E680s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, plant growth seemed to be
better with the ES300s.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is me just observing my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any hardcore data which shows
that plant growth is better with one light
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just my observation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ES300s are known for having that IR in
their spectrum to initiate the Emerson
[SPEAKER_00]: effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So faster photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people out there that
grow with that light that can swear by it
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, that's one reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second reason why is just for
flexibility purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally like to have two lights
over that coverage area versus just one in
[SPEAKER_00]: case some of my plants are taller than
others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, then I only have to adjust one light
up and then I can keep the other light
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a high 50s humidity dangerous during
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, how do you keep the vents open
during your night cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do keep my vents open during the night
cycle, the room that my grow tent is in,
[SPEAKER_00]: is dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make sure that it's completely dark so
that way light isn't coming in to the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent during their dark cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the high 50s being dangerous
during flower, a buddy of mine actually in
[SPEAKER_00]: Boston who's doing a grow right now is
running about 55%, 58% RH and he has
[SPEAKER_00]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's pretty rare to get it at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the conditions got to be real
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially with the lack of air flow,
air circulation across the canopy because
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple of those are virtually everywhere
and all they need to do is settle in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically, yes, if you're running
high 50s humidity and flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is still risk for things such as
powdery mildew and mold if there is a lack
[SPEAKER_00]: of air circulation in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your Instagram handle?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only Instagram handle that I
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And beware of that because there is people
out there impersonating me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has happened before.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have actually friend requested or
followed all the people that follow me and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually sent them DMs saying that my
genetics are available and people got
[SPEAKER_00]: ripped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, it's unfortunate that there
are scammers on that platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could you please tell me how often you use
molasses on your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you use it in the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use one tablespoon of molasses per
gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I've learned from
Oakster Dam University.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several grows out there that
use less than that significantly less than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use one teaspoon of molasses
per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to experiment there and
see what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used molasses throughout the grow
before, you know, seedling stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: veg stage into flower stage, early,
mid, late flowering is when I primarily
[SPEAKER_00]: use molasses in my grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did a complete video on this on
my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about what molasses is,
which one to use in your garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then also one way to feed in molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use mycorrhizae any other time
during the grow or only when you
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I primarily use mycorrhizae when I
transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I transplant and use mycorrhizae,
there's really no transplant shock that
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the plant doesn't slow down
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more effective to use
mycorrhizae sprinkling directly onto the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do use it as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll mix it in water, then water
their plant with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a couple weeks from harvest and I
found Nanner's on a couple buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news is you're close to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a couple things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, you have a harvest now,
harvest early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if your trichomes aren't at its
highest potency and they're mostly clear
[SPEAKER_00]: still, it could have more of an energetic
effect and not be very long lasting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may want to just finish out those
final weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people probably would
finish out those final weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you can do in the meantime is
take tweezers and pluck off those bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now sometimes it's going to be rapidly
forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see bananas every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need to get in there and
pluck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there's some phenos I've had that have
bananas where it's just been one or two
[SPEAKER_00]: batches on the plant and then several days
have gone by and no new batches have
[SPEAKER_00]: formed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can either pluck them for
the last two weeks or just harvest early.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hesitant to try soil because I hate
bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I primarily grow in Foxfarm ocean
forest soil and there has been times where
[SPEAKER_00]: a fungus gnats have come with the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten several comments on my videos
in the past where people call Foxfarm soil
[SPEAKER_00]: complete trash because they've had such a
bad experience with pests in their soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can certainly get rid of those
pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different ways to battle
fungus gnats, which is primarily what
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in the soil in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, just let the soil dry out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungus gnats, they thrive in wet
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your soil is saturated at all times,
they're going to love that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Letting it dry out, it'll actually kill
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll all go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also yellow sticky traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put yellow sticky traps by the
soil and the fungus gnats are attracted to
[SPEAKER_00]: that and they'll get stuck to it and then
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also various products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nat mix is what comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually just sprinkle it as kind of a
top layer over the soil and then fungus
[SPEAKER_00]: gnats aren't able to survive in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all the questions I have for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you learned a thing or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before I end this video, I want to do a
giveaway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually got this for free and never
used it and I don't plan to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to give it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regenna root.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a zero zero one, this one liter
bottle of this.
