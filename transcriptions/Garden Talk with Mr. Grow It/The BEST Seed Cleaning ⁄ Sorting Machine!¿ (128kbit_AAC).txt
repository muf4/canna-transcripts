[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I picked up this seed cleaning machine not
too long ago, some people call it a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: sorter, and figured I'd make a quick video
showing you how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a few different seed
cleaning machines that you can find if you
[SPEAKER_00]: search the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a larger design, it's about three
feet tall, and that works really well,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I figured I'd go for the more compact
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is pretty small, in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dimensions are 18 inches wide,
12 inches tall, and nearly six inches
[SPEAKER_00]: deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have it just resting on two five
gallon buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the seeds will be sorted into
one bucket, and the plant material will be
[SPEAKER_00]: sorted into the other bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant material does need to be very
dry and completely crumbled up,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the seed should be separated from the
plant material, not really connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: it, because you're going to place it in
the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to go down into the machine,
and the fan is actually going to blow it
[SPEAKER_00]: from the left up and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be the light plant material that
goes into the bucket on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then seeds are heavier, they're
dropped down on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fan that's connected to this is an AC
Infinity fan, just connected to my wall
[SPEAKER_00]: outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first time ever using this seed
cleaning machine, so I'm going to start
[SPEAKER_00]: off by using it at medium speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now different plants have different size
and weight of seeds, so depending on what
[SPEAKER_00]: seed you're working with, you will adjust
the speed with the variable speed
[SPEAKER_00]: controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so here I have my plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all broken up the best I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got this little piece of wood here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a skewer, just so I can push
the plant material down if needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here I go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm emptying the plant material into the
machine, and you can see the lighter plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material is actually being blown up over
and into the bucket on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the heavier seeds are actually
dropping down into the left bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so I ran everything through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some of the plant material is
actually blown out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't actually go all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stuck there because it's so light
the wind was just kind of pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: outwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like we have one area here where
seeds were stuck, so this design is
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, removing the seed cleaning
machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is what the bucket on the right looks
like, the bucket with the plant material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can see a whole bunch of
underdeveloped seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bucket on the left has all of
the good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it should be good seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure it's not perfect, but you can see
a majority of the seeds are nice and dark,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a high chance that they are
viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for testing purposes, I am going to
take the bucket on the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the plant material and all the
underdeveloped seeds, break it up a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more with my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to dump it out onto a
screen and then break it up with my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to run it through the machine
one more time, and I'm going to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's any developed seeds that went
ahead and got launched over to the wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I ran it through again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the plant material in this
bucket, and then the seeds in this bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like there are some clearly
developed seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the color is going to be real
tricky, so you can't fully say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: underdeveloped just by looking at its
color, because some seeds may still be
[SPEAKER_00]: like a gray color, but still be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I poured it out onto my screen
and just separated the remaining ones by
[SPEAKER_00]: hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, this machine is going to save me
a ton of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually already did save me a ton of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have been sorting this by hand for
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to invest into this machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know your thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're new to my channel, I would love
to have you subscribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my Garden Talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my Garden Talk podcast on here that
is every single week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'll do Q&A videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those get scattered on my channel as I
have time, and every once in a while
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be a topic video that shows up on
this channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outro card here, the video on the
left is one of my recent Q&A videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the video on the right is
automatically generated by the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tuning in, everyone,
and I will catch you in the next episode.
