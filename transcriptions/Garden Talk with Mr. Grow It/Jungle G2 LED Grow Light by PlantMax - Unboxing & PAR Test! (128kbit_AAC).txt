[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you're that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extra channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here I have the PlantMax Jungle G2 LED
grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over this grow light
specifically to do this unboxing and PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: test video.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time watching one of
my PAR test videos, I do these just to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a general idea of what the PAR
output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could increase the numbers that you
see on the PAR meter, but knowing these
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers should help determine what the
light distance should be from the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light to the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the Apogee MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers, plus or minus 5
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers, and the measurements are in
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, after I unbox the unit, there is
this Ziploc bag that includes a power
[SPEAKER_00]: cord, these brackets to hang the light,
this cord here is for daisy chaining,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 24 volt adapter, and the user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so I've been told that the coverage
area for this grow light is at least 2
[SPEAKER_00]: foot by 4 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this grow light does not
physically fit in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I place this grow light in a 4 foot by
4 foot grow tent, which is actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty snug fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I take the measurements,
I'll try to keep my PAR meter on one side
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be taking measurements at three
different distances, 12 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches away, and 24 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before taking measurements, I plug this
grow light into my kilowatt meter and it
[SPEAKER_00]: shows 245 watts being pulled from the
wall, and it shows 2 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up, and we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
See you next time.
See you next time.
