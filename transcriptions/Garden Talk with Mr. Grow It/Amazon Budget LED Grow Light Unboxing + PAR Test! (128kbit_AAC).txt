[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll watch my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunrays sent me over their 2000 watt LED
grow light and in this video I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: unbox the unit and I'm also going to test
the power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out the box is this welcome
guide it has some various instructions on
[SPEAKER_00]: the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the extended warranty card and a
little note there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A 5 foot power cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: One rope ratchet hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one wire hanging kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the grow
lights features in this video but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a link to this grow light in the
description section below so you can learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really this is just to give you a
general idea of what the power output is
[SPEAKER_00]: for this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test isn't meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reflective walls could increase the
numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the Amazon listing Sunrays mentions a
full foot by full foot flowering coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: area with the light 24 inches away from
the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video I'll take three different
measurements 20 inches away 24 inches away
[SPEAKER_00]: and 36 inches away and this is in a full
foot by full foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the veg switch on it pulls 224 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the flower switch on it pulls 202
watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with both the veg and flower switches
on it pulls 406 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
