[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely not the optimal way to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a way to grow that is extremely
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are in a place where you have no
energy access, where you can't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: pump, you can still grow things
hydroponically using the Kratky method.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be as complicated or as simple as
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The simplest versions of these are
extremely simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can guarantee most people have the stuff
they need from a growing perspective in
[SPEAKER_01]: their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you use something like a normal miracle
grow that is a high urea for fertilizer in
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics, the plants will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the plant gets the solution,
it will uptake some things and release
[SPEAKER_01]: some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things that the plant uptakes
and release heavily affect the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it seems very intimidating,
it can be done and you will be saving
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself like a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: in to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 79.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Daniel
Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 20 years and
runs the Science and Hydroponics YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode he talks all about
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some good information
for beginners such as the basics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's also a lot of advanced
information included in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that already have
experience in hydroponics but want to take
[SPEAKER_00]: your knowledge to the next level,
thanks to all of you who support this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support, you can do so by
going to Patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to VivoSun for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: VivoSun recently released the Smart Grow
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smart Grow system helps streamline the
growing process by automating stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth requirements, on and off schedules,
spectral range, airflow and circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even records useful data about your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Wi-Fi capable and connects to the
VivoSun app so you can control your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space from your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their website at vivosun.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will provide a link in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their clip-on oscillating fan is now
released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using their 6-inch version for
over 6 months now, and I absolutely love
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to clip on the side of my grow
tent, and it has 10 different speeds which
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it easy to control air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do also have non-oscillating versions
of these clip-on fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: These fans are currently in high demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they sell out of the fans,
which I expect them to often, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-order them for the next release.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also use discount code MRGROWIT if
you're buying off their website,
[SPEAKER_00]: acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That discount code works for all AC
Infinity items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or discount code MRGROWIT15 if you're
buying off Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Daniel Fernandez
from Science and Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me, first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoyed your podcast,
so this is a great opportunity for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to have this talk with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you reached out to me through DMs,
like I mentioned before, we hit the record
[SPEAKER_00]: button here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed you from the Cultivation
Certificate Program at Utah State
[SPEAKER_00]: University with Dr. Bruce Bugby,
and I actually attended that and I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a couple videos through that
program, and I recognized your name right
[SPEAKER_00]: away through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yes, he wants to come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have extensive knowledge when
it comes to hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have a whole YouTube channel
based around it, and that's what really
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're going to get into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk all about hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into some stuff for
beginners, but we're also getting into
[SPEAKER_00]: some more advanced knowledge stuff for
those folks that have the experience that
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is going to appeal to a
wide audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, what I like to do with all the
guests is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you mentioned, my name is Daniel
Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into gardening around 20 years ago
when I was 15.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I had a big space that I could
grow things in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a friend told me that we should
try hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually started growing tomatoes
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, that was right before I
started studying chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did my undergrad in chemistry while I
learned hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I went and did a PhD in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been working in hydroponics ever
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been working in my own gross 20
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've been working with people as
a consultant for the past more or less 12
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with a basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super basic for the beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is hydroponics and what are some of
the hydroponics systems out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as straightforward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there are a lot of definitions out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think about hydroponics as any
crop where you have no soil in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, any time where you're growing
plants and there is no soil that contains
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrition that the plants need,
then that to me is a hydroponic crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the scientific community, it will be
more formally defined as a crop where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have only water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where you have no media to support
plants, while the gross where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: media supporting the plants, for example,
when you're growing cocoa or in rock wool,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are more referred to as soilless
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think about all of those as
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, that's to me, it's the science
of growing plants without soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: like hydroponic culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regarding the types of systems that you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on the type of plant that you
have, you have access to different
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most basic systems that we have are
basically a plant with its roots sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: in water where you have all the things
that we what we call deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and what we call Kratky systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you then have these usually caters to
plants that are smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And normally you have then systems for
bigger plants that you can have things
[SPEAKER_01]: like dodge buckets where you have large
amounts of media there or you can even
[SPEAKER_01]: have bigger plants in what we call like
they there are industrial systems to this
[SPEAKER_01]: type of thing where we have channels,
you know, if somebody has ever seen a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic crop where you have these huge
gutters that are normally made of plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you have plants grown on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants, these systems are
usually what we call nutrient flow
[SPEAKER_01]: technique systems, NFT systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also have DFT systems, which are
deep flow technique systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these systems can be used to to
grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned the Kratky method,
and that's a method that has been around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't yet talked about it on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain what is the Kratky method
and how does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Kratky method was created by Dr.
Kratky in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around 20 years ago, more or less,
are the first papers about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have papers up until like the
mid 2010s, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea here is basically to grow a
plant with no energy input.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens is that when you have
something like a plant that is sitting on
[SPEAKER_01]: water, that the roots are in the water,
the water needs to contain oxygen for the
[SPEAKER_01]: roots to uptake nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the water runs out of oxygen,
then the roots will die normally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens in a Kratky system is that
we want to be able to grow without having
[SPEAKER_01]: to introduce that oxygen, because in a
normal deep water culture system,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll need to constantly pump air to keep
that oxygen high enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in the Kratky method, we say we
don't even need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're going to do is that simply
we're going to add all the water that the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs for its entire life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to let the roots
drain that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant will transpire that water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by reducing the level of the water,
the roots that get exposed to the air will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually be able to absorb oxygen and use
that oxygen transported to the roots that
[SPEAKER_01]: are actually submerged in the water to get
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this way, you can grow basically any
plant provided you can put all the water
[SPEAKER_01]: that's ever going to be needed in the
initial reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this sort of method is sort of limited
to plants that are small, because you can
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine that a tomato plant might use,
I don't know, 100 gallons of water through
[SPEAKER_01]: its lifetime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might be difficult for you to create
a tall 100 gallon container and then have
[SPEAKER_01]: it empty, while a lettuce plant might use
a tenth of that or even less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might use very little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water, which allows you to basically put
the plant inside of the plant in a bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: where the roots are growing into the water
and then they transpire the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water level is dropping, is dropping,
is dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows oxygen to be transported and the
plant does not die.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a low yielding method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yields in Kratky are obviously lower
because the plant is under like a so
[SPEAKER_01]: optimal condition the entire time trying
to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can grow healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even grow tomatoes if you like are
willing to replenish solution and
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce a little bit of labor into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is definitely not the optimal way
to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a way to grow that is extremely
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are in a place where you have no
energy access, where you can have a pump,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can still grow things hydroponically
using the Kratky method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've heard a lot of people having
success with that method.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like they said, the same thing you did
is it's a simple method, but I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't tried that method yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, really interesting to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a lot of people out there
that, you know, they hear about
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics talking about a whole system
that needs to be purchased.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are spending hundreds of
dollars on systems, but really you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to spend that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a DIY.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually build it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have the materials just lying
around their house or in their garage,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about how to create a
basic DIY hydroponic system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so it depends fundamentally on the
level of complexity.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need in reality is a container
that you can put a plant in with water in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about a Kratky setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a Kratky setup, you can use a mason jar
to build a Kratky setup, or you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of container where you can place
the plant and then have the water inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the container.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no need for any sort of high tech
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a container is enough for starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, what do you want to achieve
with your growing system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just want to grow a plant and see
it grow and you don't care too much about
[SPEAKER_01]: learning about what's going on and your
priorities are to spend less time growing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's your priority, then a Kratky
system is going to be a great introduction
[SPEAKER_01]: and something that you can do basically
set and forget type of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if you're interested in growing
and learning more about hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: then a deep water culture system is close
to the exact same thing, just with an air
[SPEAKER_01]: pump in, just with an air stone and an air
pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is that because a deep water
culture system is way more efficient,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant will gather way more nutrition
from it and therefore the chemistry will
[SPEAKER_01]: be affected significantly more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you will need to do things like pH
monitoring, EC monitoring, adjust the
[SPEAKER_01]: level of the solution, all these sorts of
things that a Kratky setup doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with because it's a less efficient
growing method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody can do a deep water culture system
with minimal investment for a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also go more into it and then
there are a bunch of alternatives that are
[SPEAKER_01]: midway between buying something fully made
and building it yourself from complete
[SPEAKER_01]: scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, to build an NFT system,
maybe you don't want to cut the plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: gutters yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just buy the gutters already
pre-made and then do the rest yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be as complicated or as simple as
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: The simplest versions of these are
extremely simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can guarantee most people have the stuff
they need from a growing perspective in
[SPEAKER_01]: their house, not counting the fertilizer,
but just the containers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can make it as more advanced as
you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some DIY people have gone into fully
automated hydroponic systems where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have peristaltic pumps doing all the
nutrient dosing and the pH adjusting and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have environmental control.
[SPEAKER_01]: DIY in hydroponics goes as simple or as
crazy as you want it to go depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your level of interest, the amount of time
that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a buddy who actually just grows one
plant and he took a five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lid, cut a hole in the top,
dropped a net pot in there, had his air
[SPEAKER_00]: stones fed into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you have the hydroton pellets
in the net pot and stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's all he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: He monitors his water level, there's some
maintenance, but very, very basic,
[SPEAKER_00]: something you can do on your own with very
minimal money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make that well known to the
folks that are beginners and maybe feel
[SPEAKER_00]: overwhelmed listening to this because it
can be that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several videos on my channel
about a system that I built using what was
[SPEAKER_01]: like a four gallon bucket, a five gallon
bucket with a net pot and a lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Kratky system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't have a pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did monitor the pH on the EC247 because
part of the objective was to log it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I could have not done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely can be extremely simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into the fertilizer side of
things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What fertilizers can be used and then what
fertilizers can't be used in hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very interesting question and a
question that comes up very frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fertilizers that most people are used
to are the fertilizers that are used for
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil has a big advantage to it and it's
that it has a lot of microbes that can
[SPEAKER_01]: process things into other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most importantly, you have urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a very, very common commodity
fertilizer because it's practically the
[SPEAKER_01]: cheapest form of nitrogen you can get,
of reduced nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can use that in soil because
there are bacteria there that can convert
[SPEAKER_01]: that urea into nitrate, which is a form of
nitrogen that plants do best with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in hydroponics, there are usually no
such bacterial populations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you use something like a normal
Miracle Grow that is a high urea
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer in hydroponics, the plants will
die because they will not get any nitrate
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pH will acidify extremely fast
whenever that urea is decomposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically if you're thinking about soil
fertilizers, especially the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: containing soil fertilizers, all those can
not be used in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also a lot of things that are
insoluble that are used in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of fertilizers like rock
fossil, phosphate, like maybe we have
[SPEAKER_01]: composts.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have things that are good for soil
because the microbes can break it down,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in a hydroponic setup, they would just
sit there and they wouldn't dissolve at
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we definitely don't want to be using
anything that is insoluble or that is the
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong chemical form.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a bunch of things that are
shared between both worlds.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, calcium nitrate, which is a
super common fertilizer, used to green out
[SPEAKER_01]: yards like front yards, green up
incredibly easily when you apply calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a fertilizer that is sort of
used in those situations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it is also very commonly used in
fertilizers because in the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you're using hydroponics,
you could use in soil, but not the other
[SPEAKER_01]: way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything that is hydroponic fertilizer
is going to be usable in a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, but the other way around is
not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to buy a fertilizer for
hydroponics, then you need to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it is formulated for hydroponic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not familiar with the chemistry
of how all this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you're actually a proponent of
making your own nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about how to make your
own nutrients for hydroponic systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk about making your own
nutrients, I refer to using, so most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the fertilizers that you can buy that are
for hydroponics are built in blends of raw
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I mean when I say make your own
fertilizer is instead of buying these
[SPEAKER_01]: boutique blends for hydroponics,
you can actually make your own from these
[SPEAKER_01]: raw fertilizer inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I created a program that's called
Hydrobody that I created 13 years ago in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2009 that basically helps you formulate
your own fertilizers using these raw
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chemistry can be extremely intimidating
to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand that this is not very easy
to do, but there are some baby steps that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be involved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, instead of having to make a
complete fertilizer with all the elements
[SPEAKER_01]: that are required for a plant to survive
from scratch, from all the different raw
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer inputs, you can actually start
by going into, for example, a fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: like 51126, for example, like a master
blend or a Peters 51126, which has already
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the things blended in ratios that
are adequate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you just make the calcium nitrate
and the let's say monopotassium phosphate
[SPEAKER_01]: or some of these other fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sort of a meat point between these two
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from there, you can move into
making your own concentrated solutions so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can then prepare your own
fertilizers at your house or at your grow
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can also move instead of making
your nutrient solution, you can also move
[SPEAKER_01]: perhaps it's less intimidating to then
start making your own amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are things, for example,
like Calmax that you can make yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calmax are fertilizers that use calcium
magnesium salts that I have a video about
[SPEAKER_01]: making a Calmax and you use calcium
nitrate, calcium acetate salts of these
[SPEAKER_01]: sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: You blend them and you create a solution
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's your Calmax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I'm talking about all it's very
hard to talk about such a complicated
[SPEAKER_01]: topic in such a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to my website or if you look
at my YouTube channel, I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: videos about how to actually make your own
fertilizers, where I talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry of how to do this properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: What inputs to use, which sorts of
formulations to make.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an entire world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I want people to take from this
is that even though it seems very
[SPEAKER_01]: intimidating, it can be done and you will
be saving yourself like a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: because the markup in these hydroponic
fertilizers, the markups are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the margins that fertilizer
manufacturers make are very, very large,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially the ones that are selling you
fertilizers that are specialized for
[SPEAKER_01]: certain plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will be usually the most,
most expensive because like definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: Peters or MasterBlend, they aren't making
like a lot of margin on their 51126 or
[SPEAKER_01]: these sorts of blends that they make that
are for like the large scale horticultural
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say there must be a
significant cost savings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you spend the time to do the
research, to learn how to do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go into your website or YouTube
channel or whatever, and learning how to
[SPEAKER_00]: formulate your own nutrients in the long
run, it'll definitely save you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thanks for sharing that with us
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost savings, just to go a little bit
deeper into the cost savings are normally
[SPEAKER_01]: for a single person making this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can be, it can be even a hundred
times cheaper if you're willing to buy a
[SPEAKER_01]: large quantity of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to ask about organic growing and
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say it's not possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people that say it is
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about organic growing and
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it actually possible or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how you define it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we define organic growing as the
agricultural practice that grows the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it is impossible because by
definition, hydroponics does not include
[SPEAKER_01]: any soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we start with that definition,
then the answer is that it can't be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if we go for a more holistic
definition where we do not say soil must
[SPEAKER_01]: be involved, but let's say no processed
fertilizers can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: No like synthetic fertilizers can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we go into a world where can we grow in
a hydroponic setup using only the raw
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs that would be allowed in a soil
hydroponic crop, in a soil, sorry,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a soil organic crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So could we do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is that we can, we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I've worked, I've been working with
several large scale facilities growing
[SPEAKER_01]: leafy greens organically and we have
achieved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look at that in my Instagram
and you can see pictures where we're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing plants in fully organic solutions
in a hydroponic environment where we are
[SPEAKER_01]: even beating the yields of the
conventional hydroponic setups that are
[SPEAKER_01]: right next to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be done and it can be done very
successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it is tricky because a lot of the,
as I mentioned, there are things like the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen cycle that does not exist in a
hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to separate things a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we do need to do is a lot of
pre-processing of the solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So while you would mix, for example,
I don't know your, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: corn steeply core is a very common source
of phosphorus in organic growing because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very high phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains a lot of lactic acid,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you used it in hydroponics as is,
it wouldn't work well because that amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of lactic acid would be toxic to the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to pre-ferment that in a tank
with adequate bacteria to get all those
[SPEAKER_01]: organic acids to be used and turned into
CO2 and we eliminate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way we can create fertilizers
that can be used in a hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now at a large scale, we do this at the
large scale facilities, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are already companies that are
producing these like fertilized,
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-fermented inputs that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a company that is, I'm not
affiliated with, which is called
[SPEAKER_01]: AgriHousta, which has like potassium
nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Equivalent solutions, calcium nitrate
equivalent solutions that are all OMRI
[SPEAKER_01]: registered and that are derived fully from
organic inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are just processed so that all
these available forms of nutrition are
[SPEAKER_01]: already there so that they don't need to
be generated right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if we define organics as growing
plants using only OMRI approved inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: then we can do it and we can do it with
like, we need actually active bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: populations to be able to achieve these
without a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about microbial inoculants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you touched upon microbes earlier
in this episode and you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really no exchange happening as
far as the conversion of elements in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are microbial inoculants useless when
growing hydroponically or are they useful
[SPEAKER_00]: in some ways?
[SPEAKER_01]: They are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, this is super controversial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the evidence is all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the scientific evidence of
microbial inoculation in hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the answer is if you're
perfect, the benefits from them are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be very limited because if your growing
conditions are absolutely perfect,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes are very little to contribute
because everything is already perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not perfect, then they might
give you some breathing room if you screw
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can help you if your growing
conditions are not perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's stress going on, there might be
mechanisms by which they can protect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not all hydroponic systems are suitable
for microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a deep water culture system
and you add microbes to it, it will be
[SPEAKER_01]: super dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the solution does not cater to
those microbes, then those microbes will
[SPEAKER_01]: likely become, or they will encourage
pathogenic microbes then getting in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are going to have microbes,
then the solution needs to cater to them
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the media also needs to cater to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a decision that needs to be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to have microbes or is it not
going to have microbes?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it is going to have microbes,
then design everything around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not going to, then design it so
that it's not going to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also easier to have microbes in
hydroponic systems where the solutions are
[SPEAKER_01]: not recirculated.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you have a drain to waste
setup where you are just irrigating a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in a soilless medium, then inserting
microbes there is far easier than if you
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculated the solution because the
microbes are just going to be there with
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be in your drip
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be in your tags.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to be anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually, if you are going to introduce
microbes in a system like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: usually you're not going to have a problem
when you do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I consider them useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another point is that microbes can also
help you with pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are microbes that are not for the
plant, but for fighting pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while they might not help you with the
uptick of nutrients for the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: just the fact that they're filling an
ecological niche in the root zone will
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that something else that's pathogenic
will not be able to fill it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So furthermore, there are some microbes
that will actively fight things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you have, let's say,
root aphids and you inoculate your media
[SPEAKER_01]: with Bavaria vaciana or with other
microbes that are pathogenic to root
[SPEAKER_01]: aphids, then they will fight the root
aphids when they get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So microbes are insurance in my view.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are something that we do not need to
grow perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can grow perfectly, if you are not
perfect, then I think that it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to hurt you if you add them and you have
designed your system so that adding them
[SPEAKER_01]: is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree when you said it was a
controversial topic because I get a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are arguing both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thanks for bringing some clarity on
that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into silicon next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about silicon and silicates and
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silicon is not an element that's
necessary for plant life, at least for
[SPEAKER_01]: many plants, like there are some plants
like grasses that require silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for plants like tomatoes, cucumbers,
lettuce, you don't really need silicon for
[SPEAKER_01]: them to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have found through research that it is
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of research in the
scientific community showing that if you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get silicon into a plant, then it will
at the very, very least protect it from
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that we have so much evidence for
that we already take that as fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you get it into the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is that the chemistry of
silicon is tricky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the silicates that we have,
most of the minerals that contain silicon
[SPEAKER_01]: are not soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are just not going to dissolve in
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we get silicon in the water?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have these products that are called,
we have these types of minerals called
[SPEAKER_01]: silicates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these silicates like calcium
silicate, potassium silicate and sodium
[SPEAKER_01]: silicate are soluble in water at really
high pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a pH of above 11,
then all of these will be soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as soon as you can create a
concentrated solution of these silicates,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're dissolved in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can add a little bit of that to a
solution, to a hydroponic solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the pH that you have in hydroponics
between five, five and six, five,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say, all that silicate will be
transformed into silicic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a form that is available to
plants for their uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some hypotheses that other
slightly larger forms of silicon are also
[SPEAKER_01]: available to plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very difficult to test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is that these silicic acids,
these monosilicic acids are extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: unstable in their pHs between four and
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are extremely unstable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will quickly polymerize and be
unavailable for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the main issue with this
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there are some products that will not
give you silicates, the basic solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they will give you monosilicic acids,
stabilized monosilicic acids, which can
[SPEAKER_01]: exist in a stable form at a pH below two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have these silicic acid with
molecules that can stabilize its structure
[SPEAKER_01]: at a pH below two, then it will not
polymerize because this polymerization
[SPEAKER_01]: forms quartz like silicon dioxide,
which is insoluble or a silica gel
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have these two extremes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when those stabilized silicic acids
get put into a hydroponic solution at a pH
[SPEAKER_01]: of five, eight or five, five, two,
six, five, the question is, are they
[SPEAKER_01]: polymerizing as well or are they not?
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, very few people have studied this.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we know that there are some
differences in availability of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these stabilized silicic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several, I mean, probably a
handful of studies right now that are
[SPEAKER_01]: showing that it is different than
monosilicic acid derived just from
[SPEAKER_01]: silicates whose pH has been dropped to the
pH in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which is better for root uptake?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is also the question of foliar
feeding of silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you feed silicon through the leaves and
not through the roots, then you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider that silicon is completely
immobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it is immobilized inside a plant and
placed somewhere, it will not move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this means you need to routinely apply
it because tissue that grows after you do
[SPEAKER_01]: the foliar will never get the silicon that
you applied before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it better to apply one form or the
other?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it is unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Evidence is pointing to the fact that it
is not exactly the same, but as silicic
[SPEAKER_01]: acids, ability like a stabilized silicic
acid's properties will depend heavily on
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was stabilized for and how that
was achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are maybe like 30 ways to achieve
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is when things are marketed as
monosilicic acids, just bear in mind that
[SPEAKER_01]: what sort of stabilized monosilicic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: When mixing silica into a reservoir,
it's generally recommended to mix it in
[SPEAKER_00]: first and then mix in your other
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about why that is and
then also what order nutrients should be
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed into your reservoir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally you will mix the silicates
first because silicates are more stable in
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they encounter a solution that has more
things in it, more cations and more
[SPEAKER_01]: anions, it is bound to be less stable and
polymerize faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you add it first because the least
amount of things that your solution is
[SPEAKER_01]: ever going to have will be when it's like
water or tap water, when you have added
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you add the silicone to that and when
you add the silicone, the pH will be
[SPEAKER_01]: higher and it will be a little bit more
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally you will inject silicone first,
then you will inject whatever is more
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic, which is normally a solution
containing acidic potassium phosphates of
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort, which is normally monopotassium
phosphate or things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So silicate, then this acidic solution,
then the nitrates usually go or the
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium containing solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally you will set the pH with
an acid to the final pH that you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is normally a way that works well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not the only way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could also, for example,
do add the silicone, then set the pH,
[SPEAKER_01]: then add the other things, then set the pH
again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although that is not very effective in
terms of like the amount of control that
[SPEAKER_01]: you require.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've mentioned is usually the
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is also very common to put a mixing
chamber right after the silicone,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're using an injector
system, because the silicates,
[SPEAKER_01]: if they are not fully mixed into the
solution, then they can precipitate when
[SPEAKER_01]: the next injector injects things into the
line.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are mixing into a large reservoir
by hand, then you need to ensure that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's properly mixed before adding the
other nutrients to your solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another controversial one I wanted to
touch base on is gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here people add in gypsum into their
hydroponic systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's others that say you shouldn't
do that because it's not soluble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give us a low down on gypsum, calcium
sulfate in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an entire video on just this like
precise topic of gypsum in hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gypsum is not as soluble as many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not calcium nitrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is very soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it is, I mean, it is not as insoluble
as many other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not a rock phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is way more soluble than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is definitely not soluble enough for
you to prepare a concentrated solution of
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum to use in your hydroponic setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will not work, but you can get 400
PPMs of calcium from gypsum, like from
[SPEAKER_01]: gypsum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is soluble enough that you
could dissolve enough to supply more than
[SPEAKER_01]: double the nutrient requirement of the
highest calcium requiring plant in a
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, you would need to add it directly
to the final nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot, as I mentioned, prepare a
concentrated solution and then add it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will need to add it to the final
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have one thing and it's that
the kinetics of the solution of the gypsum
[SPEAKER_01]: are slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it will take time for it to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will take time in the order of maybe
hours for it to properly dissolve in a
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that gypsum has that is
quite tricky is that its solubility goes
[SPEAKER_01]: down as temperature increases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to mix it at pretty low
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a solution that's above 70
Fahrenheit, then gypsum is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: less soluble than all the solubility that
it could have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it can be used.
[SPEAKER_01]: So under precise conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting a little bit deeper into water
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the optimal water temperature when
growing hydroponically?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in most cases, I would say that around
70 Fahrenheit is the optimal temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: for roots in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow at a little bit higher
temperature and that can be optimal for
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants under some conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then we start getting into the point,
you know, oxygen solubility goes down as
[SPEAKER_01]: the temperature goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's a system that has issues with
its oxygenation, then that's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: help at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you have a media that
retains too much water between
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigations, that's not going to help at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So normally if you're at 70, that's
perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are at 75, plants can, most plants
can tolerate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are at 80, then you're going to
have low oxygen and fungal and bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: issues because especially anaerobic
bacteria will love solutions that are low
[SPEAKER_01]: in oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And high in temperature to the low side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you go to 65, you might still be
able to find, but the problem is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: kinetics of nutrient transport becomes
lower as the temperature drops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the uptake of nutrients becomes more
sluggish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start having issues with the uptake
of some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you drop below 65 phosphorus
uptake drops to basically zero because it
[SPEAKER_01]: does require substantial I mean,
it does require the temperature for the
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake because of these kinetics of
uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you drop the temperature below 65,
you'll start noticing that your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: will basically turn purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of that, which some people use to
their advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the water temperature is one of my
biggest concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a desert region and I think
right now it's at, okay, in this room
[SPEAKER_00]: right here, it's at 81 degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned off the AC for recording.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's about 78, but water
temperature, what I heard is over 75 is
[SPEAKER_00]: really, you're at risk of those pathogens
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've just avoided DWC, hydroponics
in general because of that reason why.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know there are hacks around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people add in like frozen water
bottles into the reservoir to lower the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people buy a chiller to reduce the
water temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are solutions for controlling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're adding in a chiller,
you have to consume more energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do a cost analysis, see if it's
worth it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one of my biggest things
that I've avoided hydroponic growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: is water temperature alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to tie it to the previous topic,
one of the things that mainly limits
[SPEAKER_01]: Kratky usage is water temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if the water gets hot,
then it's not going to work at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a main limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you say, normally plants tolerate
warmer air way better than warmer water
[SPEAKER_01]: because warm air still contains 20%
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants will do much, I mean,
if you're growing in a hot region,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is much better to do something like a
Dutch buckets or a system that is like a
[SPEAKER_01]: drain to waste system with cocoa,
because that way you can very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: control the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if your plants get hot water for like
water at 85 for a few minutes or 30
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes while you irrigate, irrigate them,
they will still get the air soon after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's way, way less trolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH super important when it comes to
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: What pH is optimal for hydroponics and
then stabilizing pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get into that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's tricky for some people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the optimal pH in hydroponics for
plants for most higher plants is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be, let's say between five eight and six
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to be narrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But plants can do well between five five
and six five.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really the region that they do
fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very important to keep them in that
region because when you go to the lower
[SPEAKER_01]: end, you start getting very high uptake of
some nutrients, micronutrient uptake
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes way too high below five five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also sulfur uptake becomes way too
low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to the upside, then you get
issues with micro uptake becoming too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing that happens is that your
micro uptake just plummets, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: iron uptake at high pH is super,
super low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you need to take care of
your, of your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do you make it stable?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are two things that change your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what the chemicals that are actually in
there when you prepare the solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the most important thing that changes
your pH is how the plant modifies the
[SPEAKER_01]: solution when it gets it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the plant gets the solution,
it will uptake some things and release
[SPEAKER_01]: some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those things that the plant uptakes
and release heavily affect the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way to stabilize the pH of a
solution and the media is to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that the ratio of the things that the
plant uptakes causes as little of a shift
[SPEAKER_01]: in the pH as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: This normally means that you'll need to
play with your ammonium to nitrate ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants will generally uptake a lot of
nitrate and push the pH up under normal
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, when they're especially in vegging
phases, they will push the pH up due to
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you add some ammonium, that ammonium
is uptaken really fast and it
[SPEAKER_01]: counterbalances that so that the plant
does not modify the pH much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to stabilize the pH of the solution
itself is very problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not also catering to the
chemistry that the plant wants to uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you just try to add buffers or
add stuff to like force the solution to a
[SPEAKER_01]: pH, and you feed things that the plant
will uptake very drastically and
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatically affect the pH, then it's
going to be a losing game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the best solution that you have to
control the pH is to make sure that the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients that you're feeding are actually
buffering the nutrient uptake of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can buffer this nutrient uptake
through this, but there are other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, you have tomatoes that uptake
massive amounts of potassium and will
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily acidify the solution at some
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in those cases, you might want to use
more nitrate, for example, to
[SPEAKER_01]: counterbalance the extreme uptake of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a bunch of strategies you can
use in terms of the nutrient uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you need to consider the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like just chemically adjusting the
solution does not work that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, when you adjust the solution,
you can also consider the uptake when you
[SPEAKER_01]: adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a very common strategy is
that when the pH increases, you add nitric
[SPEAKER_01]: acid with ammonium in it so that you both
replenish the nitrogen, but you are also
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing the ammonium to nitrate ratio
so that every time you adjust,
[SPEAKER_01]: the probability of adjusting is lowered
because you are shifting things a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit every time you adjust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of like smart adjustment of
the pH works better than doing just
[SPEAKER_01]: adjustments with regular acids or bases.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will notice that companies will often
sell pH ups and pH downs that take these
[SPEAKER_01]: into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH ups are not just potassium hydroxide
and pH downs are not just monopotassium
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate or phosphoric acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They include other things to help you
buffer nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you're saying most of the
causes are due to the fertilizer not being
[SPEAKER_00]: balanced for that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody, generally speaking,
if somebody is growing hydroponically and
[SPEAKER_00]: they continue to struggle with that stable
pH, they may want to consider going to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they might consider changing the
ratio of certain things in your fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: so that they need to fight that less.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's also the case that some
plants will be will grow way better in a
[SPEAKER_01]: way that is very destabilizing to the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is also a counter to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you are going to be growing a
plant at its maximum potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe your pH will never be stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You sometimes need to compromise that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also, for example, let's say
you're using a drain to waste setup and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're irrigating with a pH of six and
then your runoff is always like six,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can then water at lower pH like at
five, five to like compensate that change
[SPEAKER_01]: so that your runoff does not shift that
much and it's in the zone that you want it
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can also play with the,
because what matters is the pH of the root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in systems where you are watering and
then that solution is not recirculated,
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to consider that you are blind to
the pH of the root zone and the pH of the
[SPEAKER_01]: input is not as important as the pH of the
root zone that you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did actually watch your video on runoff
and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally recommend it for anybody who
hasn't seen it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You clarify a lot of things in that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, I want to get into EC or PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the optimal range for hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an interesting question because
different ions conduct electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: differently and therefore the EC of two
solutions with different composition,
[SPEAKER_01]: they won't be chemically equivalent to the
same EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm saying is that while you might
be at a certain EC that works well for a
[SPEAKER_01]: given nutrient composition, then if you
have a nutrient composition that is
[SPEAKER_01]: substantially different, then that same EC
will not be equivalent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why talking in terms of EC is a
little bit misleading because then a
[SPEAKER_01]: person might say, hey, I grew at an EC of
one five and it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another person might say, well,
I grew at two and then the solutions are
[SPEAKER_01]: very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you look at what the actual
osmotic pressure of the solutions is,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might be the same at one five and at
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not a good practice and I know
why it's so common, but I think it is more
[SPEAKER_01]: useful if people only do EC comparisons
when they're talking about the same
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I prefer to think instead of
the EC, what are the optimal nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios in hydroponics?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the optimal nutrients to grow in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we can have a deeper conversation
about and that goes into the formulations
[SPEAKER_01]: that are better for each plant according
to the tissue that each plant is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not the same to grow ahead of
lettuce than it is to grow a tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: because in one case we're growing fruits
and in the other case we're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what tissue are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your nutrients need to cater to
whatever tissue you want to be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say that the type of
plant would certainly have an impact on it
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more controversial topic for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know people are going to love this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any science behind flushing,
particularly medicinal plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to harvest when growing in
hydroponics or actually growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question is, is there a need to
flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should we always flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does flushing accomplish anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: So flushing really does not take anything
out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: This idea that the plant will lose
nutrients because you flush is completely
[SPEAKER_01]: false.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the plant will not lose any
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It already has taken up due to flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that won't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you will do is that you will
completely reduce the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you need to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're growing at very high
easy values in the root zone, maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: lowering the EC will give the plant some
breathing room and it will be able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: better for let's say that ending period.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are you growing at like the same
stable, easy nutrient concentration the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you flush, then you're going
to deprive it of those nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_01]: end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to deprive it of those
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why you would.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you are going to be wasting some of
the most efficient, like the ending part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the growing cycle is the part where you
get the most yield because it's where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the most structure to build into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you benefit from it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can benefit from it, then you
should use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cannot benefit from it because your
conditions do not allow you to benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from it, then you shouldn't because that's
why there is a big disconnect sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: when you talk about people who like plant
scientists who grow the plants perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say, well, I flush and it's
absolutely no benefit to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a detriment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, well, because you're
growing this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you grew this way where you have
all these much higher EC in the media,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you would see a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you see a benefit or not
depends on whether you need it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is definitely not something that
should be considered as should always be
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be done when it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So taking a step back and taking a look at
the folks that are new to hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: what advice do you have for those that are
new?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people who are new to hydroponics,
I would say you can start a very simple
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponics is a great way to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lot of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is both a blessing and a curse
because then you need to realize that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are very likely to fail because you have
all the power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in soil, there are a lot of mechanisms
that are working in your favor without you
[SPEAKER_01]: doing anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: In hydroponics, you have total control,
which means you have total responsibility
[SPEAKER_01]: over the fate of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very likely that you will kill
several plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all of us who have ever grown
plants have probably a lot of those plant
[SPEAKER_01]: carcasses in our closets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is not anything to be afraid of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can try small systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say start small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on your region, I would say
if you are in a cooler region where your
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures are fine, you can try a
Kratky method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if it's a small indoor thing,
if you want to grow outdoors, then you
[SPEAKER_01]: might want to try a soil-less media type
of thing like a cocoa grow or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, where you have a little bit
less concern over the temperature of the
[SPEAKER_01]: water and things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be afraid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done simply.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done in a very complicated
manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are nutrients that are very low cost
that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just go ahead and try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like asking that question towards the
end of the episode because it gives the
[SPEAKER_00]: guest a chance to speak on something they
didn't speak on the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also provides a ton of tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like everybody who asked that question to
just provide so much good information,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because a lot of the audience,
a lot of them tuning in right now are
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're in a state that just
legalized, for example, a certain plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're starting to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having that advice for beginners,
it's super valuable to a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks for sharing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question I ask towards the end is,
how can the listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you have upcoming in the
future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have my website,
scienceinhydroponics.com, where I talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about the science of growing plants
without soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to go into the scientific
literature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to address topics in a manner
that is more evidence-based than other
[SPEAKER_01]: sources.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have my YouTube channel,
scienceinhydroponics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also have my Instagram with the same
name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can find me in all of these
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do consulting for small to large
hydroponic growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am one of the only consultants that you
can get on the hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most of the large scale hydroponic
consultants would never consult with you
[SPEAKER_01]: without a consulting contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've kept my hourly consultancy and
consulting basically to allow the little
[SPEAKER_01]: guy a chance to benefit from my experience
and also the experience of other
[SPEAKER_01]: consultants and growers I work with so
that the consulting is not monopolized by
[SPEAKER_01]: the big guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool that you offer
consulting like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of people out there
that need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really, really awesome that
you're there as a source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to your
YouTube channel down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're tuning in on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find them.

[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love for you to tune into
future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daniel, thanks so much for coming on to
this episode today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the episodes where I'm
going to watch back several times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably to grasp all that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, hope we keep in touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe you can come back for part two
sometime in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I mentioned, I'm a big fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely love doing part two,
going deeper into some of the topics that
[SPEAKER_01]: people find interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, until next time, peace out,
everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for tuning in.
