[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka MrGrowIt, and you're tuned into
[SPEAKER_01]: my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here I have the Bloom Plus BP-1500 LED
grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sent me over this grow light in order
to do an unboxing and part test video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also going to do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jumping right into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing out the box is the user
manual, which includes information on the
[SPEAKER_01]: BP-1000, the BP-1500, and the BP-3000.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also includes some grow tips,
such as recommended hanging heights and
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly instructions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next out the box is the fixture.
[SPEAKER_01]: This fixture does come with the power cord
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And last thing in this bag, they include
some wire hangers and two rope ratchets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to talk about all of the
features in this video, but I will leave a
[SPEAKER_01]: link to this grow light in the description
section below so you can learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the power test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ-500 power meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers, and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_01]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this fixture is emitting any light
outside of that range, it will not show on
[SPEAKER_01]: this meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this part test is really just to give
you a general idea of what the power
[SPEAKER_01]: output is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not meant to be exact.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm taking measurements in a grow tent,
which has reflective walls that could
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowering coverage area is two foot by
two foot, and I'll be taking measurements
[SPEAKER_01]: in a two foot by four foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do my best to keep my power meter in
a two foot by two foot space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be taking measurements at three
different distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the recommended distances shown
in their user manual.
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 inches, 18 inches, and 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I've plugged this light into my
kilowatt meter, and it shows 1.17 amps,
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling 143 watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's get into the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reminder that there is a link down
in the description section below,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you can click on that to learn more
about this light, and I'll leave it at
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
