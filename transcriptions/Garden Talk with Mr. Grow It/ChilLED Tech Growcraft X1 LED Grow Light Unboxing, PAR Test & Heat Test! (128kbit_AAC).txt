[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilled LED sent me over their new grow
light the X1 and in this video I am going
[SPEAKER_00]: to unbox the unit so you can see what
comes in the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do a PAR test on it and I'm
going to do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all the specs
that this grow light has but I will leave
[SPEAKER_00]: a link down in the description section
below so you can click on that to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay first thing I'm taking out the box is
this t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: The t-shirt actually does not come with
the grow light it is an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase In this bag there is a power cord
and also an extension cord.
[SPEAKER_00]: This bag includes a dimmer as well as a
set of rope ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this box is the meanwhile driver and
lastly is the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chilled LED is actually doing a giveaway
on one of these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also doing a giveaway on the X1
mini.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving away a t-shirt and hat and
some chilled LED sunglasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to their giveaway in
the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Range PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD and this PAR test is really just
to give you a general idea of what the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light is recommended for
side lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do list a coverage area of 2 feet by
4 feet on their website so in this video
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take PAR measurements in a 2
foot by 4 foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I showed you during the unboxing it
does come with a dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not plug in the dimmer for this PAR
test so the light is operating at full
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take measurements at three
different distances 12 inches,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches, and 24 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the X1 into my kilowatt meter
and it shows 1.36 amps pulling 163 watts
[SPEAKER_00]: from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
the giveaway down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to click on that to learn more
about the giveaway and to join it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
