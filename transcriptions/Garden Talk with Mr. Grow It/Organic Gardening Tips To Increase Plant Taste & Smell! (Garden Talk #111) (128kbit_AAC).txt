[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 111.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Luna
Whitcomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been gardening for 15 years and
has experience with indoor, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, and field cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is a writer for Skunk Magazine,
and her methodologies revolve around
[SPEAKER_00]: organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has knowledge on microscopy,
biology, entomology, agronomy,
[SPEAKER_00]: botany, and enzymology.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, she talks about organic
gardening methods that she does in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to help improve the taste and smell of the
final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk Clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a channel dedicated to short clips
of these podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals of this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: My entire ventilation system is AC
Infinity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have their inline fan, ducting,
carbon filter, and their controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Controller 69 Pro, with
temperature, humidity, and VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: programming, and having control of
different fan speeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it so much easier to control my
grow environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their Controller 69 Pro version also
controls their oscillating fans,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow lights, and humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discount code MRGROWAT15 works on both
Amazon and their website, acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stash Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using Stash Blend for over a
year now, and it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I really like is
that it saves me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole bunch of different inputs in
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I no longer have to go out there and
buy a silica bottle, then a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed bottle, beneficial bacteria,
then a separate one for mycorrhizal fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that plus more is in this one
blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to stashblend.com to learn more about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a link down in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Luna Whipcomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I initially came across you through the
FCP channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've been on there multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just search your name into YouTube,
there's several different talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of knowledge when it comes
to gardening, more on the advanced side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which really piqued my interest because we
do have quite a bit of advanced folks here
[SPEAKER_00]: that tune into this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're all into the organic side of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I wanted to get into
today is organic gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of folks, their goal is
really to bring out a good taste and smell
[SPEAKER_00]: in the final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So utilizing these methods and how we go
here, if you have any tips along those
[SPEAKER_00]: lines, please feel free to mention them
because that is certainly an end goal for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into the questions,
can you just give us a little background
[SPEAKER_00]: about yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us how you got into gardening and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Luna Whipcomb.
[SPEAKER_01]: I specialize in agronomy, soil biology,
microscopy, enzymology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a lot of work on building soil and
making nutrients available in soil through
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing nutrients through the soil
mineral balancing theory, as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: making them available with mimicking root
exudates, adding amino acids, enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: carbohydrates, and processes that promote
biology, consume nutrients, cycle them
[SPEAKER_01]: through their different processes,
and make them available to plants to
[SPEAKER_01]: promote health, vigor, flavor,
and aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I originally got into gardening through
growing medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started cultivating in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been cultivating for 15 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing outdoor, living soil outdoor organic
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing in-ground, using a lot of teas,
a lot of different inoculants,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of compost, and really forming an
alliance with nature to promote healthy,
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous medicine, to grow real medicine
that's therapeutic, flavorful,
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyable for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also done it in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have experience doing consulting on hemp
farms and growing in green houses,
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor, outdoor, using synthetic
nutrients, also using organic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just touched on all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to ask you a controversial
question right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many growers claim that growing with
organic inputs and utilizing microbiology
[SPEAKER_00]: results in the plants producing a better
taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: They swear by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, hey, organic, way better than
anything bottle grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I subscribe to that ideology also.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done hydroponic cultivation for many
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also done living soil and organic
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: From my understanding of how it kind of
results in better flavor and aroma is that
[SPEAKER_01]: each of these compounds that produce
flavonoids, they produce aroma,
[SPEAKER_01]: they produce the different diversities of
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all require a complex chain of
compounds prior to their formation to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to be expressed, genetically
expressed in a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're lacking any piece in the chain
that's required to biosynthesize these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds, they simply just won't
synthesize.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a hydroponic growing environment,
we have a much more narrow profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our major ones that you hear of,
the NPK, the calcium, the magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes down to different forms of
nitrogen, different forms of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: different forms of calcium, living soil
has a much broader diversity of these
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds while also including a diversity
of amino acids, a diversity of enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: a diversity of organic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These compounds all have, they create
unique physiological responses in plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and they produce different genetic
expressions.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a larger diversity of these
compounds, it allows the plant to
[SPEAKER_01]: biosynthesize different flavonoids and
volatile organic compounds, the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that produce aroma like esters,
phenols, thiols, which produce a different
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, a more depth profile of aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that that's more achievable and
more likely to be achievable in a living
[SPEAKER_01]: soil setting, in an organic setting,
than in a hydroponic setting.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, that's going to be based on user,
on the user success.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you're growing in organic
doesn't necessarily mean you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: end up with a better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the times, it's more difficult
for people to grow in organic settings
[SPEAKER_01]: because it can be a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may not have an end result that is
more flavorful, has more aroma,
[SPEAKER_01]: more aromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's potentially possible
that you can have more flavor,
[SPEAKER_01]: more smell, but it doesn't necessarily
mean that you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good way to break it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you've revealed some information
here that hasn't been revealed on any of
[SPEAKER_00]: the past episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things, a follow-up
question to this is, and I know we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into microbes here in a
little bit, but this relates to microbes
[SPEAKER_00]: is, what is their impact to the taste and
smell that the plants express?
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes, during their processes of
decomposing organic matter, they secrete
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes that are key components to
processes that provide the diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: organic compounds needed by plants to
produce different flavonoids and aromas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also secrete enzymes, they secrete
carbohydrates, they break down organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, but they also convert particular
organic acids into other organic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also break certain organic acids
down so they're no longer viable,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're no longer useful by the plant,
but they can also stabilize organic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned earlier, organic acids
have specific plant physiologic
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulating effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbes, with their interaction with the
soil and the diversity of compounds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, the nutrients, the organic acids,
like I had said, and the broad profile of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different things that exist inside
of the soil, their role changes the
[SPEAKER_01]: composition of these things and allows for
wider diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, on top of that also, microbes can be
what's called endophytic, and what that
[SPEAKER_01]: means is they can exist inside the cell of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inside the cell of the plant,
they also do these processes, but an
[SPEAKER_01]: important part of this, like an important
piece of this puzzle is that they also can
[SPEAKER_01]: create phytohormones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, phytohormones, they trigger specific
actions in the plant, they can trigger
[SPEAKER_01]: like pest defense, stress responses,
they can promote different flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: stages, they can promote, you know,
node elongation, you know, bud swelling
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made by the plant, but they use,
like the plant and the microbe work
[SPEAKER_01]: together to create these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be created in the soil,
they can also be created in the cell of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we have our decomposing microbes that
do what I had mentioned, but we also have
[SPEAKER_01]: our endophytic microbes, which can exist
inside the cell of the plant and produce
[SPEAKER_01]: these phytohormones directly at the cell
to stimulate the plant to do these
[SPEAKER_01]: different processes and produce more
aroma, more flavor, resulting in a better
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endophytes is something that I picked up,
learned from Jeff Lowenfels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had him on the podcast in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a really good breakdown of
endophytes and their role, and he was so
[SPEAKER_00]: excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say a newer thing that's kind of
been learned over the past, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five, 10 years or so, it seems like
there's more focus talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: endophytes versus just the soil microbes
and really uncovering more things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're learning about endophytes and how it
impacts the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, really cool that you had mentioned
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're extremely fascinating.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talking about the other microbes,
particularly the ones in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you did a really good breakdown on another
talk I had tuned in of yours, talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, bacteria and fungi and
archaea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give us kind of like layman's
terms or just kind of the basics of those
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, kind of information growers
should know to help improve plant health
[SPEAKER_00]: and growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what it sounds like you're referring
to is like the soil food web, and we have
[SPEAKER_01]: like our lower bacteria, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, you know, kind of just what you
think of when you think of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have like our protozoa,
which are kind of just like the predators
[SPEAKER_01]: within the soil world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Protozoa actually means early animal or
first animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're supposedly the first step in
evolution between bacteria and animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they do is they run around,
they swim around, they little wiggle
[SPEAKER_01]: around and stuff, and they consume the
lower bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, the lower bacteria consumes organic
matter that possesses forms of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the protozoa will come around and
consume that bacteria and unlock those
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They change it from one form to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I had mentioned earlier, just kind of
touched on it, there are different forms
[SPEAKER_01]: of these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different forms of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what this biology is doing when it's
consuming lower bacteria is it's changing
[SPEAKER_01]: it from one cycle to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hear this as the nitrogen cycle or
the phosphorus cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nematodes are like tiny little worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: They serve a whole bunch of different
functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's predatory nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different species of
nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of the time they consume
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also consume fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this process, they're breaking down
and releasing nutrients from bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also converting things like
polysaccharides into simple sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they're taking complex sugars or
turning them into simple sugars,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're allowing for other biology to
consume it and feed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all just like this big cycle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also have amoebas and archaea
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all kind of serve similar
functions as protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's flagellates.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're within the protozoa family.
[SPEAKER_01]: But further on, like in the soil food web,
we have microarthropods, which are tiny,
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny insects like mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mites can actually consume forms of
protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also break down and tread organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their excrement is full of nutrients
for the plant as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all of these components are required
to really have a healthy, living organic
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that's full of cycling nutrients and
a diversity of compounds that promote that
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor and that give people the outcome
that they're looking for with living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and organic culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tailor different fermentations,
whether they're aerobic with oxygen
[SPEAKER_01]: multiplied with oxygen or anaerobic
multiplied without oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can tailor different fermentations to
introduce specific forms of these biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can also tailor them by adding
different food sources to our
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different species of bacteria,
they prefer different food sources,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is why there's different types of
agar plates and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we can actually tailor our
fermentations through different food
[SPEAKER_01]: sources, through different
polysaccharides, as well as different
[SPEAKER_01]: enzymes and amino acids to promote
diversity within our fermentations and
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce them to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of more complicated and
requires a little bit of understanding,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a really, really fascinating
aspect of living soil that I think people
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't ignore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also really a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you hear about people talking about
lactic acid bacteria serum or fermenting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, making activated, effective
microorganisms or aerated compost teas and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of the foundation of it,
but you can take it a little bit further
[SPEAKER_01]: when you understand how biology works and
what it requires to multiply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can promote the multiplication of
very specific species of biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you're using inoculants like
a source inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, there's
phosphorous-solubilizing microbes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can introduce phosphorous-solubilizing
microbes, the food source they prefer,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the enzymes that they secrete
to kind of give them the home and the
[SPEAKER_01]: stimulation they require to thrive and
multiply them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's kind of like the
next level, like advanced stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: people can get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really takes someone from struggling
with living soil and organic cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: to like really taking full advantage of it
and seeing like its real potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can be intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, the juice is definitely
worth the squeeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I highly encourage people to dive down
those rabbit holes and learn about
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and biology to, you know,
level up their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think a lot of people use
microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're buying it off the shelf,
whether it be like a mammoth pea or
[SPEAKER_00]: tribus, or there's a ton of different
microbial inoculants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're using those,
they're adding them in, and then of
[SPEAKER_00]: course, they're doing their jobs in the
soil there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use any microbial inoculants or are
you kind of doing like the IMO,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural farming process?
[SPEAKER_00]: IMO, for those that don't know,
it's Digious Microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's basically a process that's done
where you can get microbes naturally from
[SPEAKER_00]: your native soil, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about kind of microbial
inoculants, like ones that you use or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe the IMO process if you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually don't use the IMO process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have particular opinions about it,
and we can get into that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to first answer your original
question, I will use some microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: inoculants, specifically if I'm after a
particular endophyte, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these bottle inoculants,
they have, you know, bacillus species that
[SPEAKER_01]: are pretty common and exist kind of
ubiquitously in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really harness them just with
high quality earthworm castings and insect
[SPEAKER_01]: frass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to just source that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My inoculant source is earthworm castings
and insect frass, which is my preferred
[SPEAKER_01]: method of inoculant because insects,
they do what's called mesophilic
[SPEAKER_01]: composting, where they take organic matter
and they break it down mesophilically,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is like medium temperature,
which so they have, we have mesophilic,
[SPEAKER_01]: we have thermophilic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermophilic would be like traditional
composting where you're turning and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: getting really hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That heat can limit diversity of microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also produces CO2, not in any excessive
amount that it's really damaging to the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, but potentially it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I prefer to not put the labor in to
turn compost piles, but to use insects
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of as my allies to break down organic
matter faster, in my opinion, with less
[SPEAKER_01]: labor and produce a wider diversity of
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I can introduce as my microbial
inoculant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I am after very specific species of
biology of microbes, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the phosphorus solubilizing bacteria that
I had mentioned earlier, I'll pick up a
[SPEAKER_01]: product like mammoth pea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also, you know, find all source
enzymes that are secreted by those
[SPEAKER_01]: specific bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can buy them online.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different websites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce them to like a fermentation,
find the specific food source that they
[SPEAKER_01]: prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Introduce that as well and let them
multiply so that I'm not limited to the
[SPEAKER_01]: very small amount that I've purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like to do that with a bunch of
different biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds kind of intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I do use bottled inoculants,
I'll find specific bottled inoculants that
[SPEAKER_01]: have specific endophytes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another one is rhodocytomonas
palestris, which is a photosynthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: endophyte that you can find in a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a photosynthetic plus or if I'm
sorry, photosynthesis plus, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: micro life product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the two that I really use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use micro life photosynthesis plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll also use mammoth pea because
those have very particular bacteria that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one would be like nitrogen,
solubilizing and fixing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are like the big ones that I'll
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the big inoculants that I'll go
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I use earthworm
castings and insect frass as my go-to for
[SPEAKER_01]: my inoculants for my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earthworm castings, insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those two inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use them in just about every grow as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, let's first get into initial
soil mix, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your kind of recommended soil
mix to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are going after the
one-to-one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clagmus Coot is kind of made that famous,
although he got that from a university.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget which university he got it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's one part where it's either peat
or cocoa, one part aeration, and then one
[SPEAKER_00]: part of compost or worm casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people add fertilizer on it
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's your recommended soil mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love Coot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually done podcasts with him
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't follow that heavy of an organic
matter mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll max out my organic matter at about
20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen great results with organic
matter as low as 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% from a study that I've seen recently
released by Cornell University is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the maximum that Cornell has recommended
in recent years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that Coot is a very
knowledgeable person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that that study was from a
while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He released that Coot mix quite some time
ago now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably the most well-known
living soil organic mix out there is the
[SPEAKER_01]: Coot mix, because he was one of the first
people to just release it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of what's my favorite mix,
if I told you, you wouldn't know the name
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no one would know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do is I follow a system called
the Albrecht soil mineral balancing
[SPEAKER_01]: theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage everyone to look this up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has different ratios of nutrients
that are applicable to different soil
[SPEAKER_01]: compositions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of them being rich potting soil
that's mixed with peat or cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has different ratios for NPK,
so on, through your trace minerals,
[SPEAKER_01]: your micros.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I like to follow,
is the soil mineral balancing theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some bagged soils that I will
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's Sensisci that I like to use in
southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew these monster plants in southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years ago, and I used that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a cocoa core based mix that was
also balanced with Albrecht soil mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was an agronomist that came up with
this approach to regenerating and
[SPEAKER_01]: remediating soil after the dust bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: He saw that there was a problem that
needed to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he came up with these techniques and
released it to the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was all kind of ignored because
there was a whole bunch of ammonium
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate that had just hit the industry
after the World War.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people, you know, there was a
gentleman, I forget his name, but he
[SPEAKER_01]: realized that you can use ammonium nitrate
to grow crops with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it totally changed the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it produced tons of food for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So his theory, Dr. Albrecht, his theories
kind of got brushed aside because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we can use this byproduct from
the military industrial complex to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: all this food.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's kind of becoming more
applicable with medicinal plant
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation, where people are really
trying to level up the nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient availability in custom soil
mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now it's becoming more applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you look at all of his work and it's
back, you know, in the 20s and the 30s.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely recommend people look
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any living soil mix is going to be pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They typically tend to be pretty
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I recommend people learn how to mix it
and do it themselves, because not only are
[SPEAKER_01]: you going to have a soil composition and a
soil blend that's unique to you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll produce a unique expression within a
plant, resulting in an end product that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot be mimicked without your very
specific soil mix.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can dive down this rabbit hole,
kind of learn a little bit about agronomy
[SPEAKER_01]: and create your own soil mix that will
result in your own unique product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what it also does when when you learn
this is you now have the skill to take any
[SPEAKER_01]: soil outside and turn it into a lush
fertile garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can take native soil from anywhere
with these practices and principles that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can implement and turn dead dirt into
living soil and have a farm anywhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I think is one of the most
invaluable skills that anyone can have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to encourage people to to learn
how to use these techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can then it's you can then
just possess what I think is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most valuable skills and powers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is no bigger power than being
able to feed yourself off of the land
[SPEAKER_01]: because of knowledge that you've possessed
and learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, having the end goal of being able
to use a native soil out of your backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: and use that, then you wouldn't have to go
to the store to buy bagged soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, spending money at the hydroponic
store or your local nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't have to do that if you're
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're able to take the soil from
your backyard, repurpose it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, maybe a lot of these are soils
are too compact, depending on where you
[SPEAKER_00]: live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know a lot of people run into the
issue where it's just too compact,
[SPEAKER_00]: not enough aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to add aeration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first of all, generally advised to
grab a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find out what's in your soil to begin and
then kind of make adjustments from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Ted Hussey, KISS Organics,
shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had found a considerable amount of
heavy metals in some of his native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget where exactly it was on if it was
his current land or past land,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he had mentioned that he's not really
able to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for those folks that are
interested in using their native soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably get a soil test to find out
what's in there to begin and then kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: make adjustments from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of one of the principles
that are recommended in this soil
[SPEAKER_01]: balancing theory is like, you know,
step one, you get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what it's lacking.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what it's abundant in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you make calculations and
alterations from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do have an abundance of heavy
metals over time, you can remediate it
[SPEAKER_01]: with like cover crops and biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you may not be able to immediately use
that soil right away if you're worried
[SPEAKER_01]: about heavy metals or testing
requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also options of introducing
certain inputs that will kind of suck in
[SPEAKER_01]: those heavy metals, things like biochar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also an amendment called zeolite,
which has a very unique structure,
[SPEAKER_01]: like molecular structure that holds onto
heavy metals also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are ways to like remediate heavy
metals, but you're 100% right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You a lot of times cannot just take a
native soil and start using it to grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You 100% have to get testing done and then
make calculations and alterations from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to look into that soil
balancing theory in more detail and kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of get familiar with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause yeah, that's right now I am using
just bagged soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started off with Fox Farm Ocean Forest
Soil and I turned that in and I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: using that soil for six, seven grows now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, adding organic inputs and
being able to reuse that soil over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to go to the store to buy
bagged soil anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Las Vegas and it's desert out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, I'm really nervous to try to use
the native soil in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly just sand and rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hey, I've heard it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I just need to roll up my sleeves
and figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people who even dry farm in sand
and have success with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these different regenerative
and cultivation techniques that are really
[SPEAKER_01]: unique, that have come up with solutions
to a lot of different problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just kind of got to look around for
them or ask someone who might know the
[SPEAKER_01]: answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for a lot of folks that are tuning in,
they're probably not going to use their
[SPEAKER_00]: native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably are going to go out and buy
bagged soil and then they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: attempt to use that as a good starting
point and then continue to put in organic
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, reuse that soil over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody's going that route or even
doing like a coots mix where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating their own soil mix, organic
fertilizers or organic inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you recommend and how often to
apply them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's a very broad question,
but throwing that at you, see if you can
[SPEAKER_00]: answer that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a broad question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use amendments, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use soil amendments to balance my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I focus on making those
amendments available to the plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: usable by the plant through adding amino
acids, enzymes, carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: polysaccharides, biology, and filling in
the gaps of the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: So fertilizers, fertilizer is kind of a
funny word.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of fertilizers, I guess the
fertilizers that I use would be sources of
[SPEAKER_01]: soy amino acids as my cation form of
nitrogen, the NH4 positive, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amino acids are the building blocks of
proteins.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also needed for the formation of
enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I focus a lot on amino acids in my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the cation form of nitrogen found in
amino acids doesn't leach, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear about like nitrate runoff and
stuff and how it affects the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: This doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It holds on to the negative charge cation
exchange sites in the soil better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't rinse out opposed to the
NO3 negative anion that a lot of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: sources are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of fertilizer, I use a lot of
soy-based amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use a lot of micronized inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use things like micronized
langbenite, which is sulfur, potassium,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mineral that is rich in sulfur,
potassium, and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I need those nutrients versus those
elements in my soil or my plants require
[SPEAKER_01]: them, I'll add them in micronized form
into a solution with like some fulvic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: or some humic acid to kind of create my
own carbon-based fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll also use things like micronized rock
phosphate, which is calcium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has a lot of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a lot of phosphate in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And phosphate is a key part of energy
production inside of a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, I think it's ATP, adenine
triphosphate, I think is how you pronounce
[SPEAKER_01]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's formed with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nitrogen and phosphorus, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you introduce both of them,
you're kind of creating an energy source
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do things, I focus a lot on amino
acids, micronized inputs, calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphate, potassium in micronized forms
after I've custom built my soil to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: balance of these different nutrients with
things like gypsum, fishbone meal,
[SPEAKER_01]: green sand, crab meal, shrimp meal,
kelp meal, langbenite, like I had
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is in my soil mix?
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earthworm castings are also a source of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I don't know if I would consider
them fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also other inputs that
I'll add that aren't technically
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, things that just kind of like
promote cation exchange capacity,
[SPEAKER_01]: like clays, like bentonite clay,
zeolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of it for in terms of like
fertilizer is just I use organic dry
[SPEAKER_01]: amendments that I mix into soil with a
biology source like earthworm castings,
[SPEAKER_01]: insect grass, and then my inert,
you know, organic matter, things like peat
[SPEAKER_01]: moss, coco coir, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's mostly what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't actually buy much of anything that
is like a nutrient source except for those
[SPEAKER_01]: micronized inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I like to use a lot of fulvic acids
and enzymes and amino acids also to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like promote the availability and mimic
root exudates, which is like the function
[SPEAKER_01]: of how plants make plants, I mean,
make nutrients readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a handful of those inputs that you
mentioned as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned amino acids and one thing
I'm looking at online right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, I pulled it up is raw amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are quite expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you get two ounces for $16 and 20
cents is $8 an ounce or you get like two
[SPEAKER_00]: pound for $135.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you talk about amino acids and how you
focus on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is a product like this raw amino acids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this something that you would
potentially incorporate in your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it useful?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's a dietary supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I wouldn't use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use bio-ags.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have a few different products that
have amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have calmino, they have multi-mino,
they have nitromino.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitromino is the most potent one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 14 or 15 percent nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is not that expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a pound for like $18 or
something like that, $15.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, so I think what you found was like
a dietary supplement for people because
[SPEAKER_01]: all cells require amino acids and they're
helpful for humans to consume and for the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to utilize and biology to utilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biology, plant cells, human, you know,
animal cells, you know, we all use amino
[SPEAKER_01]: acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, this one actually is from NPK
Industries and it does talk about... Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does talk about the chelates,
ion nutrients and facilitating plant
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake movement into cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this particular one does seem to
be... That sounds very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it even worth it to buy it that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we get amino acids from somewhere
else, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get amino acids from other places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, since cells are all made of
proteins, you can break proteins back down
[SPEAKER_01]: into amino acids using enzymes that break
proteins down into amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called proteolytic enzymes or
protease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a form of enzyme that will take a
protein and break it back down into its
[SPEAKER_01]: original amino acid form.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find this inside of things like
lactic acid bacteria serum, which I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: sure if everyone's familiar with,
but it's a fermentation of milk with
[SPEAKER_01]: lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus
species.
[SPEAKER_01]: That then contains proteolytic enzymes
that you can add to plant matter that will
[SPEAKER_01]: break it down and turn it into amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also specific plant inputs that
are rich in amino acids, things like aloe
[SPEAKER_01]: vera, which I'm a big fan of using in my
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just take aloe vera, whether
cultivated by myself or from like a
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store, clean it nice and good so
you don't have kind of like funky weird
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff on it, chop it up into little
pieces, throw it in a blender,
[SPEAKER_01]: strain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And water it into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of really simple
techniques like that that you can do to
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce, you know, amino acids as well
as different compounds and phytohormones
[SPEAKER_01]: to your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one that I really like is red
beet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is rich in a polysaccharide called
inulin, which is great at multiplying
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has nitric oxide in it,
which promotes, you know, metabolic
[SPEAKER_01]: processes inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The list goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have something growing in your
native environment, you can actually look
[SPEAKER_01]: up the phytochemical composition of that
plant on websites like Dr. Duke's
[SPEAKER_01]: Phytochemical Database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll tell you the full phytochemical
composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can take that information and look
it up and see what each organic acid's
[SPEAKER_01]: physiological effects are on a plant and
integrate it into your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can identify what the parts per
million of phosphorus that contains,
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium, nitrogen, and so on,
so that you can take your local native
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and through fermentation or through
just blending and straining or composting
[SPEAKER_01]: or feeding to insects, you can integrate
it into your garden organically,
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainably, regeneratively.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just so many cool things like that
that would be really difficult to cover
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them in this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can absolutely go out and find
stuff and integrate it into your garden
[SPEAKER_01]: from your local environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's where the creativity
and the art really comes into living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing that people worry about
going that route is bringing in pathogens,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of going back to the IMO process that
we talked about and bringing in good
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, but they also could be bringing
in some bad microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know with fermentation, if it's not
done right, there could be bad microbes in
[SPEAKER_00]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one thing that kind of...
That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: ...cautions people away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can definitely do it safely
from what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of what you're mentioning here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's just a matter of following
it step-by-step and doing your due
[SPEAKER_00]: diligence and looking under a microscope
and seeing if those bad microbes exist in
[SPEAKER_00]: there or not, or if there are just good
microbes in there and then utilizing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make a slide and look at it under
a microscope, but being able to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: which species and which fungi,
based on their morphological properties,
[SPEAKER_01]: is extremely difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could be sitting there looking at
stock images all day long, trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: the one thing and then think that you
found it and you haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes you see people posting
microscopy images, making claims that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have found this particular thing and
they're completely off base.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely... There's a reason why
people go to college and study for years
[SPEAKER_01]: and years and years behind this particular
study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're 100% right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring in pathogens from the
outside, which is one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really big into insect breakdown of
things, because their gut microbiome is
[SPEAKER_01]: really effective at breaking down
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a much safer way to
introduce it, which is why I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworm castings and insect grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things like doing turning of compost
piles and stuff, I have seen so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people incorrectly compost and incorrectly
make IMO and introduce pathogens to their
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes finesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of attention to detail and
thoroughness to really accomplish fully
[SPEAKER_01]: and effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just outsource that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Labor to the bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you're 100% right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can absolutely go out and take
something from somewhere and bring it in,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if your native environment
isn't entirely healthy and your native
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem isn't fully intact.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we took a short break and you
mentioned something that you wanted to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Root exudates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with root exudates at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So root exudates are compounds that are
secreted by roots to facilitate several
[SPEAKER_01]: functions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that I've touched on before is that
they feed specific profiles of biology to
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish specific goals.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, they will secrete profiles of
amino acids, enzymes, and carbohydrates
[SPEAKER_01]: that promote the multiplication of
phosphorescent or cycling bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is called the rhizophagy cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during particular stages in the
plant's development, it has different
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles of root exudates and of these
compounds I just mentioned to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: specific species of bacteria to make
certain nutrients available during certain
[SPEAKER_01]: stages in the correct proportions that the
plant wants them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the overwhelming majority of
how nutrients are recycled and delivered
[SPEAKER_01]: to a plant in a living soil system is
through root exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each species of plant is more or less
effective at feeding certain profiles of
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds to feed specific species
of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see people introduce cover crops
and companion plants, living mulches that
[SPEAKER_01]: have a diversity of different plant
species that are more or less effective at
[SPEAKER_01]: secreting root exudates tailored to
specific nutrients to make them available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see people use clover for
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere,
but it also solubilizes nitrogen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have things like buckwheat,
which is really effective at phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: solubilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: It secretes phosphatase, or it could be
phosphatase C.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, and it's an enzyme that helps with
nutrient cycling of phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like super key in bowel
remediation of soil, as well as making
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients available to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep in mind that these profiles of
biology, you know, while they are also,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, these profiles of compounds,
while they're feeding biology,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're also catalyzing chemical reactions
and covalent bonds in the soil to make
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients transform from one form to
another, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So while living soil is like an ecosystem
of bacteria and biology, it's also a
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetual chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not only are we kind of working
with nature, well, chemistry is still
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, but we are working with chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with bacteria biology,
kind of forming an alliance with these
[SPEAKER_01]: living organisms, but we're also needing
to understand how those aspects influence
[SPEAKER_01]: chemical reactions in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is done a lot of the time through
root exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can introduce and kind of mimic
root exudates with the different compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that we play with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like the key, the secret key
behind effectively growing living soil is
[SPEAKER_01]: mimicking root exudates, because this is
how most nutrients change forms and become
[SPEAKER_01]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the soil food web and how
I mentioned earlier, bacteria being
[SPEAKER_01]: consumed by protozoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the vast majority of how nutrients are
uptaken is through the rhizophagy cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: and how root exudates interact with
chemicals and with biology and those
[SPEAKER_01]: biology and that biology breaking down
specific nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy the amount of reactions that
are happening down in that area,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it blew my mind is back when I
learned that, you know, acids are released
[SPEAKER_00]: by the plant in order to, and you touched
on this, is kind of adjust the pH to make
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients more available, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Iron is a good example of that,
where the pH is too high, it's going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: iron is going to be in a form that the
plant can't uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it release acids, gets in the correct
pH range, then the iron is able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: converted into that form and uptaken by
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like there's still so much that
we don't know, that we're still learning
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, it goes above a lot of people's
heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes above my head, to be honest with
you, because there's just so much to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes over everyone's head.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tremendous amount about soil
that we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That nobody knows that we're just still
figuring out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, like you had said, there's such
a complex network of reactions happening,
[SPEAKER_01]: that how they all function and how they
all interconnect with each other is would
[SPEAKER_01]: be would be so difficult to study,
because it's all in this microcosm world
[SPEAKER_01]: that is really difficult to observe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all mixed together in this like
melting pot of things that separating them
[SPEAKER_01]: and studying them is really, really
difficult for humans to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes we just kind of have to
like, let nature do it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: let nature take care of it, let the
biology take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, that's one thing that makes
it so fun is like, we're still identifying
[SPEAKER_00]: things and we're always going to be
learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of us that are living here on
earth right now, we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: learning till the day we die, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And still not everything's going to be
uncovered in regards to growing these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And soil biology and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I read a stat somewhere where it's
99.9% of microbes haven't even been
[SPEAKER_00]: studied yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, we've got way like,
yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also is that they're constantly,
quote unquote, evolving, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not necessarily evolving as much
as like their genetic composition is
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with horizontal gene
transfer?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Horizontal gene transfer is when there is
a microbial density of bacteria to where
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so tight together inside of like a
biofilm or just like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sludge, whatever, inside a solution,
inside of water, where there's so much
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction, there's so much microbial
density that they start tossing genes back
[SPEAKER_01]: and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They start tossing DNA back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those random combinations of DNA being
passed back and forth can actually create
[SPEAKER_01]: new species of bacteria like
spontaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is how like the first evolutions
and combinations of bacteria formed were
[SPEAKER_01]: through this horizontal gene transfer back
in like the primordial soup of like early
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids and humates and enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's perpetually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can experience biology changing
potentially rapidly, but it pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: means that we will never, ever,
ever document all the different species of
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it's constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could, we could find new bacteria
that do new things every day for the rest
[SPEAKER_01]: of our life, you know, and never,
and never find them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this, it's like trying to find
the edge of the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you just can't, you just can't
do it and you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually reminds me of viruses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Viroid, those can change up too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we won't get too deep into that
when we get off the subject here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like it reminds me exactly of that,
how they're always changing, evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring it back into kind of more of,
I guess, let's loop in the beginners and
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate folks a little bit more and
give them some actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice or tips do you have for folks
that are maybe just getting started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing organically and they're really
focusing on, they want a better taste to
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a better taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a better smell to be produced
from these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's some advice you have for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say like the first kind of easy step
is make sure you have enough aeration in
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you maintain it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to keep living soil moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some habits that people learn
from growing hydroponically that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: translate to living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is letting your soil dry out
too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there probably will be people that
disagree with me and want to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: root respiration, dry backs and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be happy to get into that
conversation with people, but you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep living soil wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is because bacteria needs to be moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to have a solution, a space to
exist, a media, which is water to exist in
[SPEAKER_01]: and to multiply in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of living soil processes are so much
dependent on bacteria and biology that
[SPEAKER_01]: when they start getting dry, they stop
functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rhizophagy cycle is very dependent on
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your soil wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep your soil aerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a Patreon where I help people
and they post images and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see people just drying out their soil
too much all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure you have enough biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure you keep it wet and make sure
you have good drainage.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do that, you can just water
only.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had enough soil, you could water
only and grow a plant completely to finish
[SPEAKER_01]: in living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're having a small soil mass,
it's going to be very difficult and you
[SPEAKER_01]: will have to have to add nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be very difficult to
keep nutrients balanced in a small pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Living soil really wants large soil
masses, moisture and drainage and biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like the stepping stone for growing
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people really struggle with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the beginner step that I recommend
to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can get into fermenting and
adding different profiles and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that after you learn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot of fun to do these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like to get ahead of themselves,
but you can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can introduce pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can add too much of an enzyme and cook
your roots or kill your worms and kill
[SPEAKER_01]: your micro arthropods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just start with a lot of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it draining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Add simple inoculants like earthworm
castings and insect grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to use bokashi, that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use cover crops, companion plants to
provide the diversity of root exudates
[SPEAKER_01]: like we had discussed earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can just water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a full run in a tent in like a four
by four bed in a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was just water, companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil with, you know, nine plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just, that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have to do anything to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overcomplicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it definitely can be super simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's one thing that, uh,
you know, you talk about keeping things
[SPEAKER_00]: moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I wasn't told when I
first started growing organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was taking my practice using
synthetics to where I was letting the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium dry out between waterings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plant was showing
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Hmm, is organic really the
easier way to go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just doing it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the medium moist enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't keep a consistent moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course I learned about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had much better success having a moist
medium the whole time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Introduce blue mats, auto watering system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really dial in that moisture level in
the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just been a game changer for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love blue mats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've used them for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they're probably my favorite way to
just keep soil wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, blue mats are great, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and like you had mentioned,
and I think it's important to note is that
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're growing and living soil and
you let things dry out, you start seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms, um, plant symptoms that mimic
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When your soil actually has the nutrients
in it that the plant needs, but you let it
[SPEAKER_01]: dry out too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and you know, the, the plant was not
able to cycle nutrients effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it started showing these signs of
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what people often do is they let their
plants grow out too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see these deficiencies and then they
have their buddy or themselves or a book
[SPEAKER_01]: help them identify the deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they start pumping it with that
deficiency, I mean, with that nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and, um, and then they create an
imbalance in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that antagonizes another element,
you know, creating an improper,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for an improper bond,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then proper chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you're perpetuating this chain
reaction of errors in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you start seeing all these different
burns.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start seeing overdoses of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start seeing deficiencies of nutrients
and you're chasing your all around,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to pump your soil with all these
different nutrients, spending all this
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, when you just need to keep your soil
wet and that's, that's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they want to be like,
no, I know that it needs more,
[SPEAKER_01]: more calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it needs more magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it needs more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just start hitting it and hitting
it and hitting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then things get out of whack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things get out of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, bacteria colonies break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't function properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just keep it, keep it wet,
keep it wet, keep it full of biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's got to be one of the biggest
frustrations for new organic growers is
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping that media moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, going through the motions
that you mentioned is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: things dry out and you see deficiencies
and you're adding inputs and so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just sounds like a headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a big headache there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a huge headache.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned you caution people on
using small container sizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your recommended minimum container
size to use for organics?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pull off 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to use 45 gallons for for a single
plant if I'm using a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow in beds, though I grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big four by eight, you know, in like an
indoor setting, a four by eight bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's at least 12 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have them 18 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have enough drainage,
18 inches can provide problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 12 is good for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bed in my greenhouse is five feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 60 feet long, you know, and 18 inches
deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's how I prefer to grow is
I like to have a solid soil mass because
[SPEAKER_01]: now it turns into like an entire
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And roots go really far and my crisal
networks go really far and things get
[SPEAKER_01]: transported from really long distances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nutrients can be transported long
distances through my crisal networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to answer your question, 20 gallons,
I think, is minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Forty five is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_01]: But growing in beds is what I think is
ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I've tried growing in,
you know, organic inputs in one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: containers, three gallons, five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had pretty good results with seven
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I worked my way up to 10 gallons,
which I'm actually in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm having some pretty good success.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that as a track record,
the bigger container I go, the easier it's
[SPEAKER_00]: getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's only a matter of time
before I'm in a bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a two foot by 10 foot bed
outside for my vegetable garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love it as far as my indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a matter of time before I'm in
beds as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic episode we had today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely learned quite a bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you can you tell the listeners how
they can find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I host podcasts on the Future Cannabis
Project every Sunday at 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I rotate co-hosts and we go over research
papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like high level stuff,
really nerdy stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each co-host has like a specific specialty
that we go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at Luna all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to my Instagram, you can look at
my bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a link to all my different
articles and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I write for Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've written for Greenpoint Seeds and for
SD Microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a lot of writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my my Instagram is probably where I'm
the most active and I share my different
[SPEAKER_01]: concoctions, my recipes and my approaches,
you know, as well as how I like to shape
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and just my overall general
approach to living soil cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all mostly on Instagram at Luna
all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: The A in Luna and all is shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: So L-U-N-A-L-L-D-A-Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to where
people can find you down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for you'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a gut feeling here that there's
going to be quite a few people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: comments section asking for a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we get enough people demanding for a
part two, would you be willing to come on
[SPEAKER_00]: for a part two where you talk about
something else, kind of maybe dive deeper
[SPEAKER_00]: into one of the areas or talk about a
different area that you have knowledge on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's so much to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an endless amount of topics to
talk about in living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would be happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you want to see part two,
definitely comment down below and we will
[SPEAKER_00]: get her back on Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been this has been awesome and I
hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great day.
