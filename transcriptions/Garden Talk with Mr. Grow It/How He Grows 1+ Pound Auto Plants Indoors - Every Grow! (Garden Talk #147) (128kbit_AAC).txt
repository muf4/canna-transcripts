well known for growing massive Otto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, some yielding well over a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pick his brain to find out exactly what
he does in order to grow these massive
[SPEAKER_00]: autos.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back, and I'm joined with Lynn
from Autopotamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on to the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk all about
growing autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if anybody's been to your Instagram
before, they know you've grown some
[SPEAKER_00]: massive autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually had at least one person,
I think it was more than one person,
[SPEAKER_00]: reach out to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, you got to get them on the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to find out what he's doing to
these autoflowers because they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to pick your brain a
little bit and find out how you do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Lynn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started growing plants six
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So since Canada legalized, it was always a
dream of mine to be able to grow my own
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So six years of experience, you know,
and I've tried a bunch of stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what I'm doing right now seems to work
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What else can I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I'm Lynn.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm based in Yellowknife, which is in
northern Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I like to I like to show
some tidbits, photos and videos from from
[SPEAKER_01]: life up here, because it's a really small
population, very big territory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of nice to be able to have a
platform to also show some stuff that we
[SPEAKER_01]: do up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, when we linked up before actually
recording, we kind of want to meet first,
[SPEAKER_00]: do a little face meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about the Northwest Territory
and it instantly reminded me of the show
[SPEAKER_00]: Alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was actually wearing the shirt at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you said you were familiar with it as
they go up there and there's a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people, they drop off like 10 people in
the middle of nowhere and they got to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And watching that show, they're catching
these massive fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look at your Instagram, you've got
these massive fish that you catch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do that sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Alone show, I think I want to
say there's two or maybe three seasons
[SPEAKER_01]: that were filmed up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, on the same lake that we
live on, it's just on a different arm,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the east arm of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've flown on top of the location of
where it was filmed, because as part of my
[SPEAKER_01]: work, I sometimes take a lot of
helicopters and planes and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And working with these helicopter pilots,
they're like, yeah, we were working on the
[SPEAKER_01]: show and this is where one guy was dropped
off and this other guy was over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is literally the same lake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you know, there's giant fish out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's my dream to actually go out and
catch a fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fish like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been 20, 30 pounders.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Record lake trout.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the record, the ultimate record
was a connet up here, like 65 pounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insane looking fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a huge fan of the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched every season, except for I still
need to watch the Alone Australia and then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Alone UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to watch those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it was really cool to see that
you've been up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole different environment up
there really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This town has, I want to say 20,000
people, but it's very transient.
[SPEAKER_01]: People come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come with a three, four, five years
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they say like me, I've been here
for 14 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm originally from Montreal, Quebec,
which is like in Eastern Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close to 15 years that I've been up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to ask, where did your name come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Otto Pallimus, that's a cool name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started posting some of the plants,
some of the plants that I was growing on
[SPEAKER_01]: Reddit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then people are like, man,
these plants are huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, yeah, I think you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just looking around on the subreddit,
like auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean like, yeah, like my plants are
significant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then I decided to post my grows on
Instagram and I can't do what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without this watering system called auto
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, you know, I had to come
with a really good handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took me about, I want to say like five
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was browsing different names and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm like, auto pot, auto pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What ends with auto pot that people can
like remember, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like auto Pallimus.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good one because the hippopotamus
is a, is an aquatic animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It lives in the water and the auto pot is
a bottom wicking system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is basically hydroponics,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, man, those two together would
be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the word auto for like
automatic auto flowering and there's the
[SPEAKER_01]: word POT.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all, it all worked out together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I came up with, uh, uh,
someone helped me design the logo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clever, clever, easy to remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took about five days of brainstorming
with my friends, with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I thought it was a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a catchy one, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, I think appropriate where to
begin as genetics, genetics, genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: start off with bad genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have a bad result, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start off a good genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, your chances of having a good result
is a lot higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the biggest yielding auto
flowers that you've grown?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there any specific strains that
you recommend to get big yields?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll talk, I'll talk out of experience
because obviously, you know, I can only
[SPEAKER_01]: grow so many plants at once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I'll talk out of experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my biggest Yielder plant so far
were from three breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got Mephisto, we got a night owl by
Daz and then speed run with Ben.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so my latest run, which harvested in
January, that was a 26.6 ounce out of,
[SPEAKER_01]: out of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then the second would be a 21 and
a half Ripley's OG by Mephisto and a 19
[SPEAKER_01]: ounce plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: By night out again, which was the purple
strawberry popsicle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, they're all over a pound.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I seem to be able to reproduce that
pretty much every girl.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I have one, uh, ongoing right now,
which should be over a pound as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a pound out of flower is not out of
reach for most of everyone, as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: they know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 15 years ago, it was out of the reach,
but I think the genetics have been bred to
[SPEAKER_00]: get higher yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was the 26.6 ounce plant that you had,
was that the largest yielding one you've
[SPEAKER_00]: ever had?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 26.6.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, that was just last run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't, I haven't beat that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's an incredible plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: She was close to six feet tall and four
plants and a five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was busting up the street.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really, really big plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, uh, I don't use a trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably should.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to have my plants mobile cause I
pick them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bring them outside for defoliation,
uh, to remove some, some stems,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stuff, uh, to take some
photos.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put a trellis, if everything is more
immobile and the tent then, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't do what I want to do,
but at this point in time, I think it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be, it could be a good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into the equipment you
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you're growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you describe the equipment setup that
you have in your indoor garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to say to what everyone uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use some higher tech equipment
than me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm sure you're aware of those
AC infinity tents that everything is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plug it in and adjust the VPD,
the relative humidity, the temperature for
[SPEAKER_01]: you almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you have the hardware,
uh, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, uh, I'm analog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, uh, sensors, um, at canopy level
that tells me what the temperature and the
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity is, but then I'll,
I'll also run a dehumidifier and a
[SPEAKER_01]: humidifier depending on what my VPD tells
me to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for the most part, but everything is,
uh, I do everything by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just look at my data and I'll adjust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then the autopot obviously is a
big part of my grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've used, um, I want to say most of
their system, you know, so I'm,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm an affiliate with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, they do help me out with some of
the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do run the 3.9 gallon plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran, um, fabric pots as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bigger 6.6 gallon plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have different sizes for,
um, most of the time, the substrate that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're willing to use with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also fans, everybody got fans and I
have multiple lights, man, like I've
[SPEAKER_01]: learned the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went from, you know, Mars Hydro Blurple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had T fives, you know, I have the CMH,
uh, 315 and now I run LEDs, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some of these were sponsored and some
I bought out of pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still use the HLG QB96.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our old school, uh, do it yourself
type lights that you assemble yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was meant for like the do it yourself
crowd, but I don't think it, it took on
[SPEAKER_01]: all that much, but it's a great light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use four of those and it shoots on max
probably like 650 Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I still use those lights up to now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause they're so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can really use one up to four lights,
depending on the wattage that I'm looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the big five by five, it's a photon
tech, um, XD, a thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't run it on max.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, uh, that's too much for a five by
five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the most I'll use 750 Watts for the
five by five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for the four HLG DIY and the photon
tech you have in your other tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have like a par meter?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like measuring?
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of light that the plan is
receiving, or are you just kind of going
[SPEAKER_00]: off of kind of the manufacturer's
recommendations?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I want to say I used to, I don't have
a par meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone think it's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a photon meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think it's Dr. Dr. Meaden,
Dr. Meter, sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, on the HLG website way back then
you, there was a calculation you could do
[SPEAKER_01]: to divide, um, the lux doc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came out of it divided by 66 and it gave
you an approximate PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did do that for a while, but now that
I know my grow and my, my grow tent and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow areas so well, I don't really measure
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it sounds crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask me all the time, like,
Hey, what's your PPFD targets?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your DLA?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't, I don't really do that
anymore, but I used to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I went deep into it, like looking into all
the information for PPFD, DLA,
[SPEAKER_01]: lux, all that stuff, you know,
and it's really confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest for a lot of people that
start looking into the light metrics,
[SPEAKER_01]: extremely confusing stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I did do it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a super confusing to,
uh, look at all the numbers and not really
[SPEAKER_00]: know what you're doing, especially for a
folk is somebody who was newer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people who reach out to me all
the time with questions on lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, yeah, I guess it is a little
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably is a little surprising for
some people to hear that you're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: dying on the lights that you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having these massive yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and how about CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adding in CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that people add in
order to try to get to higher yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you supplementing CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no typically I am not though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have tried it and you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Funny enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now that you mentioned that my
previous girl was like record level yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I was implementing see too typically
am not, I had a mother earth, a bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: that's connected to a fan and I would
shoot CO2 through at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the air gets sucked by my exhaust
fan, it would climb up through the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do the up down, like they have
like those little fungus bags,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what they're called.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they put it above the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this this bucket, it was right on the
floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would, it would, it would exhaust
CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had like, I have a CO2 meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it actually did work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's only good for like,
six months, I ran out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the top up for CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I just looked that up right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about the Mother Nature CO2
generator, the five liter kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sent to me by by AutoPot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks AutoPot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I yielded a lot last run.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was, that was two tants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A five by five, and a four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the total yield for eight plants was
110 ounces.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow, I wouldn't want to be in that trim
jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the AutoPot system, it's pretty
commonly known these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how did you find out about the AutoPot
system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you walk us through the setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have a lot of new folks on here
that don't really know what the system is,
[SPEAKER_00]: how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I have probably four years of
experience with a system now pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: every day I use it, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my when I first started growing,
I did hand feeding, I had two plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, two plants in cocoa, my first grow
2018, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cocoa plants won hands down that
contest, like my yield, the plants were
[SPEAKER_01]: happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants produce more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say for like, you know,
deterring profiles, all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to me at a time, yield was very
important, and also how easy the grow was
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story short, for roughly two
years, I decided to run coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cocoa core, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's hand feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hand feeding cocoa is something else
like you can hand feed once a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: typically in veg, or you can do two,
three times a day and flour, they'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely hard to overwater a plant
in cocoa, like you really have to I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I tried I'm like watering them
like two to three times a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that comes to with the inconvenience
of having to, first of all, do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, you have to deal with the
runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a proper system,
you have to go in there with a shot back
[SPEAKER_01]: or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that takes a lot of effort,
it takes a lot of noise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after, you know, two years of doing
that, I'm over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so much work, there has to be a
solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And browsing the internet, I came up with
a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bottom upon autopot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bottom wicking system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically if you use the right
substrate, it is a form of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked my first grow with it,
I grew the most incredible plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was so easy, you basically have to
top water a few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or after a while, you just add your
nutrient mix to the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the plant basically feed
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way it works is you have a tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within the tray, there's a key part of
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the aqua valve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the aqua valve will fill the tray with
the plant in it with roughly an inch worth
[SPEAKER_01]: of water and then a stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works by ways of vacuum and
gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no power involved at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the plant drink down the whole
inch of water in the tray, the aqua valve
[SPEAKER_01]: will break the seal from the vacuum and
it's going to refill it back to one inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not have to hand water anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the first few days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, from the rest of the grow,
you don't have to hand water and you just
[SPEAKER_01]: add your nutrient mix if you're using
coconut to the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's no runoff to deal with
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically because of the reservoir
system, you can leave for a week,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, six, seven days at a time and the
plants will keep drinking as long as the
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir has nutrient water in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do when I go on a seven day work
trip or a vacation or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll fill the reservoir to its limit and
I'll even have another five gallon bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: beside it for a neighbor to dump it in as
it gets low.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that extends how long you can leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an amazing system and you grow the
most incredible plants on coconut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just can't go back, you know,
because previously if I wanted to go on
[SPEAKER_01]: vacation, my partner would have to go and
feed once, two, three times a day and shop
[SPEAKER_01]: back the nutrient, the runoff water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, it's a, it makes so much sense
for a home grower that's really busy to
[SPEAKER_01]: have like kids or to have like a very busy
work schedule or they want to go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to think about your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just mix it, dump it in, you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been using it for the better part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four years now and it's, it works so
good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had to be as part of my Instagram
handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the autopot system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, uh, actually I stopped using it
probably like a year or two ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: just cause I switched the blue mats,
but man, every run I had with that thing
[SPEAKER_00]: was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do need to just wipe the dust
off and get it back in motion because it
[SPEAKER_00]: is a fantastic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to ask you about what size
reservoir do you have it connected to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you, since it's a gravity fed
system, are you having the reservoir up a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain height?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think the manual recommends,
um, at least six inch above the tray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have mine like on a milk crate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I'll use one 13 gallon reservoir
per two plants and, uh, comes mid
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They drink really fast, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first you're like, Oh, not much is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time you're an early to mid
flower, it's incredible how fast they
[SPEAKER_01]: drink, which makes me think a lot of
people are probably under watering their
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just, they're just not aware of how
much they can drink.
[SPEAKER_01]: These plants is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, yeah, it's, uh, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I literally, I cannot go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Oh, and they have multiple products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have, there's the tray to grow that I
use in the four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just one aqua valve and it's like a
plastic tray, roughly three feet long with
[SPEAKER_01]: a wicking mat on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can grow many different ways with
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've tried, um, man,
the previous girl, I too, I tried two
[SPEAKER_01]: fabric bags, two gallon just to see,
I want to keep my plants small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm going to use something
small, two gallon, two auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, one in each obviously,
and they were both close to a pound in two
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon cocoa, just sitting on top of this
tray with one aqua valve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I legit started from scratch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even top water once.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just put it there and then just grows,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, um, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a great system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you have cocoa in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just been cocoa the entire time or
have you tried soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've tried so all my first grow and
just, uh, just this current grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was chatting with Jeremy, I built a
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, Hey man, I'd like to try some
living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just water and the reservoir, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So he shipped me up, uh, some build a soil
3.0 with some amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew, I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just harvest the same expedites by
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was 17 ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, what's the other one,
the speed run, uh, frosted Cheerios F3
[SPEAKER_01]: that came at 12 in living soil,
um, just water in the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my first living soil grow ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, this is incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just added tap water in the reservoir,
no pha, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have a lot of experience with
it, but I feel I need a couple more runs
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a really good feeling for the
reamendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much nutrient is left in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause to me, it's kind of like magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when you're mixing, uh, salts,
you're measuring everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at every point in time, you know what
goes into the system because you purposely
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But with soil, say you have two,
three grows through living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how much is left in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much do you need to reamend?
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it's kind of a, a mystery,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that, that part, that's not
quantifiable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of cool, but it's like magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's completely different from cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're mostly growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you adding in any aeration?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some people add in like perlite,
for example, and along with aeration,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you add any type of amendments at all,
or you do an assault based system for
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I believe, okay, so this,
this is the autopot.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people try to copy me,
but they, they need to have basically the
[SPEAKER_01]: same setup as me for it to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of people will try a hundred
percent coconut core like I do,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they may have issues because of the
lack of aeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the air dome, which is part of the
autopot ecosystem, as well as the air base
[SPEAKER_01]: at the bottom of my pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the air dome is connected to an air
pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it adds oxygen at the pot at the bottom
of each pot that is sitting within the
[SPEAKER_01]: tray, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Without that air dome, you might run the
risk of suffocating or even overwatering
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a hundred percent cocoa fella.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people would be, would do just
fine with some added perlite in the mix,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 50% or 30%, but I don't personally do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you run for nutrients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I ran a variety of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of similar to you, you know,
being in this field on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of company that reaches out
to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, I'll try some stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've tried a variety of nutrients,
you know, from Athena to Kana to Mills.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm using right now a dried powder
line by Green Planet Nutrients called
[SPEAKER_01]: Horti line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's brand new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's different in the sense that,
you know, a lot of people claim that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you buy bottle nutrient, most of it is
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to end up buying more and
more bottles and it weights a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, why don't I try a different
line?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's more dried salt base.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's the right
terminology and it seems to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you have your reservoir,
whatever, how many gallons you want to mix
[SPEAKER_01]: in, then you add your salt and mix it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you pH to your target and then
you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quite economical because a bag of
such powder nutrients lasts for so many
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can mix so much, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also the very scary thing about
growing with cocoa is you have to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to mix the nutrients properly,
which takes some practice, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: learn, anyone can learn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The powder-based ones are just so
convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, it goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, when you're growing with
the bottled nutrients, a lot of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a large percentage, I heard
upwards of 90% of it being water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the powdered form can definitely
take you a little bit further depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: which lineup you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you starting the reservoir in like
a low EC or I'm not sure if you use EC or
[SPEAKER_00]: PPM, starting low and then kind of working
your way up throughout the grow or how do
[SPEAKER_00]: you do the feedings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you say is correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will start at a lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have like a, it's called a Blue Lab
Truncheon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if that's how it's said
because I'm pretty French.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Truncheon comes out in two PPM
formats, a different scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also the EC scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use the EC one because then you'd
have to think about the different scales
[SPEAKER_01]: that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll start pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are, they're quite
surprised when I tell them how high I
[SPEAKER_01]: start my seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking 2.1, 2.2 EC right off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is like just sprouted this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like 2.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, plants being plants,
you, it's not just about the EC level.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light needs to be at the right wattage
or DLI or PPF if you want as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the temperature and the relative
humidity, everything needs to be right in
[SPEAKER_01]: for the plant to be able to uptake that
kind of EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Else if you run like a really small light,
you know, like 25 Watts because it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling and you feed something 2.2,
they're going to burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't, they can't process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I start them strong right
off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because these are, I grow only auto
flowers, you know, and auto flowers being
[SPEAKER_01]: auto flowers to get big plants like I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: The veg needs to be on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the veg is not on point and something
happens to the plant early on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will fast flower on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have your plant, you know,
this big starting to flower, it's only
[SPEAKER_01]: going to end up being this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need, it needs to be on point from
day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the only tricky thing about auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those folks listening on podcast
platforms, he mentioned this size to this
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was, you know, about eight inches down
up to 12 inches or two feet at the max
[SPEAKER_00]: really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stunt that happens within the first
20 days, any sort of deficiency really
[SPEAKER_00]: holds back the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a handful of auto flowers where
it's like, there's this little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: stunt and it totally ruins the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ruins the stretch and the overall,
cause it goes into flower, like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, and then just starts flowering
and the stretch stops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden you're stuck with that
size plant no matter what throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can be tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be a little
eyeopening for folks to realize that you
[SPEAKER_00]: start with that high of EC and the
seedlings age.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you keeping that for a period of
time and then upping it even further,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in flowering, for example,
like what do you, what do you typically go
[SPEAKER_00]: up to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say the peak EC for me would be
mid flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in auto flower, assuming for me,
a harvest is typically day 90 plus or
[SPEAKER_01]: minus a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking in the, in the day
seventies from sprout is roughly where my
[SPEAKER_01]: EC is on max.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be hitting close to like 2.8,
2.9 BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically my range from 2, 2,
2, 8, 2, 9 is what I typically do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you progress towards harvest,
it lowers back again towards the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 2.3, 2.9 BC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't need to be crazy specific,
but that's roughly, it's roughly what I
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mid flowering 2.8 and then a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your max light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running 750 Watts in the five by five
and the four by four.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm close to 650.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So low nutrients are lowering towards the
end of flowering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I take it you're not doing any sort of
like flushing of the medium prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of misconception about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's true or not,
but to me it makes zero sense to flush out
[SPEAKER_01]: your nutrients towards the last.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still, they're still living.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still need nutrients to grow,
but they don't uptake nearly as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the, for the purpose of like cost
savings all lower the EC, but they're
[SPEAKER_01]: still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see why, you know, in the cocoa
itself is there's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're, you're just flushing
everything, you're going to mess up with
[SPEAKER_01]: the pH of the substrate in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reuse my cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to strip everything that's in
there and have like crazy pH spikes
[SPEAKER_01]: because I added just plain water or pH
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: You reuse the cocoa, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about how you actually
go about reusing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you flushing that all out and then
starting fresh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just continuing on what you left off
with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no, I'll pretty much start.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have the same regime from day one,
whether it's new cocoa or reused cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just dump all my plants, all the
containers into an action packer or
[SPEAKER_01]: something similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let it dry and I'll remove all the
roots with a tennis racket or a squash
[SPEAKER_01]: racket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no more roots and I'll fill my
pots and I'll give it a go again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the one thing that people don't
really know, or maybe they don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they will know now, but there is some
nutrient salt buildup in the autopot
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does happen because it's bottom
wicking and the actual nutrient salt will
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly migrate to the top of the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people will notice when they're growing
autopot with cocoa, there's always a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of like white stuff on top of the
substrate and that's basically salt
[SPEAKER_01]: buildup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you won't see many roots up at the
surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: It mostly happens way down where the air
dome and the water update actually
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really hurt the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But something I've learned the hard way,
the top of the cocoa has really loose
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa and it's white and it's crusty
somewhat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not use that cocoa to start a seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will burn the hell out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was mixing some new cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine comes as brick because I live so
remote.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't order the big expended bags
because it's more expensive for shipping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll buy like the compressed brick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I ran out of it and I'm like, oh,
I just need a bit more cocoa to fill the
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings cups, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grabbed some of the top loose soil of
an old girl and I burned the hell out of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So always start seedling with fresh cocoa,
like fresh, fresh, fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know there are some people
probably a little bit surprised that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're reusing it over and over again,
having success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people are a little bit surprised
that you're not actually doing a full
[SPEAKER_00]: flush of the medium to where you're trying
to get back to really say zero PPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like basically no nutrition in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of adding in your 2.2 ECO,
whatever, whatever you want to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting to hear that your way of going
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how many runs in a row has it been
with this batch of cocoa that you had?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I never stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like four, five, six years,
six years worth of cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually as you pull the roots out,
you know, and then sometimes I'll,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll purposely chuck like the first four
inch of like salt buildup away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually I need to buy some more and
keep cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, uh, some of the
original cocoa I bought six years ago is
[SPEAKER_01]: still.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still running in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a way it's very economical,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't, I don't really waste my
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes right back to work as soon as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this thing, cocoa is so inert,
man, I've had cocoa sitting in an action
[SPEAKER_01]: packer outside all winter, all fall,
sorry, all spring until, until I is
[SPEAKER_01]: thought enough that I can use it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And boom, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes right back into my bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: That stuff is so inert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing grows in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no algae, there's no mushrooms,
nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the medium so much and the specific
one that I buy doesn't really compress
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly as other brands that you can buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll, I'll let it know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I buy Kana cocoa bricks, which is the same
as the professional plus, but it's in a
[SPEAKER_01]: brick format and it's been, uh,
pre-buffered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to buffer it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as you expand it can as a big name and
known for their high quality products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into plant training next.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do for plant
training if any on the auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, man, you know, when you browse Reddit
or Instagram and then you see people like
[SPEAKER_01]: bending the plants out of shape from like,
is this good bending?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like they ate and they're,
they're bending the plants out of shape
[SPEAKER_01]: because supposedly it yields more and all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've tried it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I tried training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried those little nineties band stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, nowadays I don't do any training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do any training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do any training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I let the plant express
themselves as, as they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't seem like my yields suffer
at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and I did topping too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, to me, it doesn't,
I don't see any benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, you know, and I like to,
I like to provide as limited stress as I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: To these auto flowers and veg,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of what I do comes after the
flowering stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're going to say like day,
uh, 15th, when the stretch is over,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I'll go in there and start
stressing up because they already,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're already almost at full size.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm trying really hard not to
stunt them is what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the same camp as you, where I do
little to no training on auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've tried topping in the past
and it just hasn't been a good result
[SPEAKER_00]: versus when I don't top, you know,
I do do low stress training and bend down
[SPEAKER_00]: the branches and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do like doing that in order to shape the
plant and make sure it fits within my
[SPEAKER_00]: growth space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's it really just the low stress
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing any topping, not doing any super
cropping, no femming, no nothing like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and yeah, it seems like the more hands
off you are with it, the less stunt and
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and the higher, the bigger the
plant, the bigger the yield that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big fan of leaf tucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'll do is under when you have
like a newish plant, you'll have your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant like this and there's going to be
your sub branches on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically there's a giant leaf on top
of it that kind of restricts direct light
[SPEAKER_01]: to the growth, the lateral growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'll do is I'll grab that fan leaf
and I'll tuck it under the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the growth is exposed to direct light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I find is that these side shoots
are able to grow nearly as tall as the
[SPEAKER_01]: main.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of my plants do not have that
Christmas tree shape where it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: big, really big tall cola and then some
lateral branch like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of mine are somewhat even,
perhaps not exactly as tall as the main,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're able to grow pretty tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't do a lot of training because
I'm not trying to yield, let's say more,
[SPEAKER_01]: I yield enough for what I'm trying to do
and say there's some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the buds that are smaller down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, it doesn't hurt me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes into a hash pile, won't make some
hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not spending a whole bunch of
time doing lollipopping or stripping that
[SPEAKER_00]: lower part and really trying to get rid of
that fluff or larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just like, Oh, well, I know I'm using
it elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I do, I do lollipop quite rarely,
but you know, there's like, some people
come in and they're like, Oh, that's not
true.
I, I do, I do lollipop quite rarely,
but you know, there's like, some people
come in and they're like, Oh, that's not
true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care about the tops, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then growing meds, apparently it's
very, it's almost like a bad breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, Oh, look at your meds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't understand why people feel
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's in your hand and it's cured,
you cannot tell the difference between,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, especially when you cut them
down to like, you know, snug size,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite happy partaking in the med.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't, I don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's like meds and tops and then the
super, super low stuff like say one foot
[SPEAKER_01]: and below that gets that gets cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll prune all that quite happily.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take much time at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess what I'm trying to say is
like, once you have a finished product,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's like mead or tops or
whatever, it's it's all fair play for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm quite having I'm quite happy partaking
in it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the yields that you are putting out is
massive, you know, over a pound per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely something to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got to ask you about your harvest
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, when do you like to harvest
these auto flower plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is your process for harvesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, walk us through a detail like
the cutting down process all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting into drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me personally, I'm about 75% about the
bud look.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a certain look to a flower when
it's ready that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: The calyxes needs to be plump.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when they're in mid flowering,
you can see them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all nice and shimmery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a certain plump look that I'm
looking for that tells me the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stigmas are for the most part orange
and kind of retracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too many of the newest flowers forming
on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, about 25% is based on
trichome ripeness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I look for zero percent clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vast majority milky spine by me and
some amber as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not just the top buds, you have to
look at the mid the bottom have a feel for
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant, whether it's ready or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a combination of all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having growing in the same way,
the same strategy for so long,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, it's it's also based on days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're closing on day 90,
I'm looking a lot more closely at my buds
[SPEAKER_01]: for for harvest.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I believe you cut the plant at
the base.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I remember correctly, at least I seen
you on your Instagram here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to hold that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole plant whole and get some good
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love those pics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you then cutting individual branches
and hanging them or are you just hanging
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant whole?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I cut branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the plants are huge,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it needs to be a manageable size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sadly do not have a dedicated room
for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll use my grow room for drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside a tent and I've got like lines
set up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll hang I'll hang the plants by
branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole idea here is I don't want
buds to touch each other for mold
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have a room full of like
individual branches all cut up and strung
[SPEAKER_01]: up together in my room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of drying strategy,
I aim for 60 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's kind of hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: To get I'm hoping to get, you know,
1012 days, but sometimes it's faster than
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I have to get in there before I
even hit 10 days because I'm scared of
[SPEAKER_01]: overdrying, which is where you lose
turpines if they're too dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, anyways, I look for a smaller
branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it almost snaps, I'm about there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I usually jar them or bag them,
I'm looking for above 62 relative humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: in that bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's below 55, I'm losing turpines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to be in the high to mid 60s.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I'd rather trim faster than
let them hang for like 10, 14 days and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just overdrying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're putting them in bags and
aiming for above the 60% like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, RH.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to jar them and that takes so much
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you're aware of the growth bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use one pound growth bags now for most
of my work because the jars are insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to open them daily for like a
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so much effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been using growth bags for
possibly the last two years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow bags are a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you don't have to do that
burping process like you have to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just it's able to escape that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: By itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you heat sealing it as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people swear by heat sealing
it versus just a regular seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lately I have not, but I have heat sealed
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I haven't really found lots
of differences between heat sealing the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag or actually just not doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but for some of, if I have
overdried some buds, I'll put a Boveda
[SPEAKER_01]: pack in there 60% as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what size bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm assuming you have bigger bags,
which size growth bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're, I think they're pound
bags or half a pound bags if I can
[SPEAKER_01]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those grow bags are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the, um, Canada troll,
which is the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very expensive though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can't recommend anybody go buy
it because it's just so much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's 1600.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to someone yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he got like 14 or 1600 USD,
which is close to like 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I would need like three of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if I'm going to go that
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm not rich like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a lot of money,
but I wish I had one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does make things a lot more easier
because you just cut up the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: individually, place them in there and then
it dries and cures dries and cures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dries, it's going to bring you right
down to that 60, 62%, whatever you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: set it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have that shelf stable and it
just stays at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, I can't say I recommend it just
because of the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just so much money,
you know, pricey, but I want one so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's harvest dry and cure for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into common misconceptions
about auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There there's just like anything in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pros and cons, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like them a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I get the yield that I'm looking for,
um, the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product itself is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC level is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent a bunch for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: One came out as like 29 eight or something
like that, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but here's one big misconception and
it's relevant to the fact that it's easy
[SPEAKER_01]: for beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Auto flowers are harder for beginners
because you not, you lose the ability to,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, veg for as long as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you lose the ability to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think they're ready to be
flowered, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are not better beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow a plant, but will you be
happy with the yield and the end product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Possibly not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're brand new in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I agree with you 1000% on that one for
those exact reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I, I, I focus on auto flowers
because exactly for these reasons,
[SPEAKER_01]: because people grow really, really small
auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm out there showing that it doesn't
need to be that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are dialed in, like I am,
you can grow really, really big plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: just be like, Hey, look at this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you want grown in 90 dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one benefit for example,
is they can grow under 24 and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do not need to rest, which is
another misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are like, everything needs to rest
in life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give them two hours of darkness
because they need to rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're kind of losing the benefit of auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys can express themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can grow under 24 and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as long as you give them as much light
as they can possibly take, they will grow
[SPEAKER_01]: huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't need that darkness at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the subarctic in the summertime.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no darkness, you know,
there is, and that's where these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: come from for the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rumors has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's true that,
uh, the creator of all the flowers grabbed
[SPEAKER_01]: these genetics from a ruderalis plant out
of Russia in Northern Russia, where it is
[SPEAKER_01]: similar environment as me, where in the
summertime is really short and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of light and it's not the season that
will dictate whether you need to procreate
[SPEAKER_01]: or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like time, you know, we got to go now
because there's not much time left.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, so those, those are the two
big ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it true that photo period, um,
have better genetics than auto flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent photo period have been
bred for so much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're way ahead of the curve in terms
of genetics, potency and terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with all these new breeders coming up,
doing some proper work, they're catching
[SPEAKER_01]: up really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually you're going to see some
auto flowers with some crazy THL number if
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what they're breeding for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also very interesting terpene profile,
you know, the same expedites that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: growing right now has like a, a sweet beet
slash carrots terpene profile that comes
[SPEAKER_01]: from, you know, a land race train in
Africa calls them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some really cool stuff going on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm quite happy growing them in the
future going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're inspiring me to get back into auto
flowers, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a little break from auto flowers,
but the takeaways in this episode is
[SPEAKER_00]: autopot system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three things I want to say, you know,
for me, uh, part of my success,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality genetics, Coco core, um,
and auto pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three combined is a really,
really solid start.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, um, we can talk about white
label genetics or strains if you want,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what I would advise is to buy straight
from the breeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can't, if not, there are third
party, um, websites or seed banks that can
[SPEAKER_01]: provide the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go on Google and you type this
auto flowering strains, a lot of sketchy
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff comes up and I cannot advocate for
that because genetics is the base of it
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know, you need to procure
seeds from a known reader, someone that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, is behind the scene,
actually thinking about the breeding and
[SPEAKER_01]: selecting the plants and doing the
crossings, not just hype from a company
[SPEAKER_01]: that you don't even know who the breeder
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any other advice for beginners that maybe
somebody who's just getting started
[SPEAKER_00]: growing auto flowers, any takeaways that
they could have?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a really tough one.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of beginners, even myself,
like years ago, you would go on Reddit and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you would look for information and
there is an insane amount of, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: misinformation out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even stuff like we talked about,
like flushing, and training and light
[SPEAKER_01]: schedules and that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is so much bad info.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I would advocate for kind of like
following someone kind of like yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: that can provide the proper information
and just follow it to a T, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because if you listen to like too many
people are reading too much information
[SPEAKER_01]: from who knows what you're going to end up
with terrible advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd follow up to probably suggest to
find a good source and then follow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that should be sufficient to get some
really nice flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for auto flowers, the best
person to follow is autopotamus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever heard of them?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a good job, you know, and,
uh, I've been doing this for a while and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy showing the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know it's not a fluke.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for many years,
you know, and I showed a process when like
[SPEAKER_01]: seedlings all the way to harvests,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I spoke about your Instagram a
couple of different times and it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really great results to see in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome pictures and big fish too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even threw some fish photos in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we like our fishing up here for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last question I'll hit you with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, actually second to last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Future of auto flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see as the future for auto
flowers from a breeding and a cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: aspect?
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I want to say is,
um, all the flowers are great for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Bitcoin is you can't clone them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you have like a really cool plant and
you want to keep growing over and over
[SPEAKER_01]: because it was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the biggest thing,
uh, is you cannot keep a mother plant on a
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's just going to flower on you and
then you can't clone it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't do nothing like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, um, you can collect seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people do that and that's a
super, super cool aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of strains that are in
demand and sometimes they come and go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, I see people collecting,
uh, an insane amount of cool genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, really actually like that,
you know, trading scenes with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, it's a big hobby of mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but in the future I can only see,
um, the genetics progress and potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: get better and better, um, each time,
you know, bigger plants, uh, faster
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, maybe cooler, turpines,
um, and more stability as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so there's a, there's a lot of like
hype, uh, photoperiod strain as well that
[SPEAKER_01]: can be bred into auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm looking forward to some of those,
you know, there's some strains that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: only known as photoperiod and I'm just
waiting for the time when it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to autos as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people will have like a lot of choices
in the future as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there is more that we could talk
about, but we're going to wrap things up
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell, listeners how they could
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm active on Reddit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I browse certain subreddits for sure,
but I'm mainly my main, my main spot is on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the link was going to be down
below, so you can, you can hit on that and
[SPEAKER_01]: see what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but something I want to mention is I'm
partnering it with, uh, I'm partnering
[SPEAKER_01]: with autopot USA to, um, have a master
class.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this master class is basically me
teaching what I know, what I do really
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to teach something I don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically I'll be, um, what we're
thinking is I'll be teaching over a
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend, all the information, everything
that I do from A to Z.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to have a girl along
with the class, um, set on a specific date
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'll come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have everyone in the chat
room, a discord channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll come in and I'll, I'll provide
advice, um, on the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone can grow just the same as me
with a lot of hands-on experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're hoping to launch this,
uh, in winter, 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to
autopotamuses channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms listening in and just search for
[SPEAKER_00]: them, you'll find them will come right up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to all the folks that support on
Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those in the producer tier are being
scrolled on the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to you, but anyone who
donates through Patreon, it goes a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent right back into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything from the editor fees to the
cost of the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the platform here to the cost to get
on to the podcast platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of that is covered through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for those folks that
contribute through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lynn, thanks so much for coming onto the
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, there's a lot more that
could be sounding like we got into
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have been a whole conversation
about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's, it's not just
growing with salt based nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: but people are doing it with organics as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are so many different ways you
can grow out of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we could potentially, continue on
the conversation in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to, if the folks demand a
part two, if you want a part two,
[SPEAKER_00]: let us know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also let us know in the comment
section, what do you do that's special
[SPEAKER_00]: when growing a lot of flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a particular light spectrum that
you're going after?
[SPEAKER_00]: Amount of light, medium, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drop it all down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to read through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming onto the podcast
and hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
