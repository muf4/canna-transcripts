[SPEAKER_00]: A new study done on the drying process
reveals that the 60-60 method actually
[SPEAKER_00]: results in less terpenes compared to a
different drying method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 60-60 method, for those of you that
don't know, is simply drying in a space
[SPEAKER_00]: that is 60 degrees Fahrenheit in a
relative humidity of 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drying in these conditions results in the
plants not drying too fast and also not
[SPEAKER_00]: drying too slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The final product has enough moisture in
it so it's not too dry and harsh when
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 60-60 method is widely spoken about
across the community It's deemed as the
[SPEAKER_00]: best conditions to dry in and these
conditions are also used in many
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial facilities as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is the science behind the 60-60
method, if any?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does this new study reveal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into my garden talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a juicy one for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to raise some eyebrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is going to cause some people to
feel anger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is also going to cause people
actually change the way they go about the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with the science of the 60-60
method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I first heard about drying in
those specific conditions, I did a deep
[SPEAKER_00]: dive to try to find studies to back its
legitimacy and there wasn't any studies
[SPEAKER_00]: available at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, still to this day, I don't think
there are any studies on the 60-60 dry
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm mistaken, please post a link down
in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to read it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as of this recording in late 2023,
there are no studies on the 60-60 method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there isn't any science behind
the 60-60 method, that doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've personally used the 60-60 dry method
for several harvests for the past five
[SPEAKER_00]: plus years and the final product was
great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm certainly not saying that it is a
bad way to go about it by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But finding out that a study has been done
on the 60-60 method comparing it to a
[SPEAKER_00]: different drying method and that different
drying method showed better results,
[SPEAKER_00]: had to share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The title says,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of you have seen the videos that I've
made on that system in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes on to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to combat negative side effects
from mishandling at a testing facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: samples were extracted immediately after
post-harvest treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, water content was measured
to correct for water dilution.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I'll have a link to the study
down in the YouTube description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also shows this chart that breaks it
down by different terpenes and shows the
[SPEAKER_00]: total terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The samples held in the Canada Troll at 68
degrees Fahrenheit, 54 dew point,
[SPEAKER_00]: had 16 percent higher terpenes than the
samples dried with the 60-60 method.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually all that they show on this
page right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see more information on this
study, such as along with the samples
[SPEAKER_00]: dried for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to assume that more details will
come out on this eventually and that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is just the initial announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking a deeper look into the CRC who
conducted the research, I see some
[SPEAKER_00]: credible people here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm very sorry if I pronounced any of
those names wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a fantastic job at butchering names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does this new information now deem the
60-60 method broscience?
[SPEAKER_00]: After learning about this information,
will you be changing your drying
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
