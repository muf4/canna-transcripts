[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't know me, my name is Chris,
aka Mr. Grove, and I just mixed up a batch
[SPEAKER_00]: of nutrients here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Blue Planet Nutrient, the Blue Max
two-part feed schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have it all mixed up, stirred up,
and I'm checking the pH at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH was at 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I actually like about
Blue Planet Nutrients is the pH ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: being 5.8 if it's a half dose,
which is the pH level I like to give my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants growing in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am growing in soil this round,
so I do have to increase the pH using pH
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I got up to 6.2, and I decided
to film this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get it up a little bit
more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pH I'm using is by Blue Planet
Nutrients, their pH up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a small cup, some RO water
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a jug that I washed out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these called again?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you're not supposed to do is
you're not supposed to take this pH up,
[SPEAKER_00]: and put it directly into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do it here for example
purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to show you what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that gray cloud?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully the camera can pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gray cloud swirling around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's actually a chemical reaction
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually learned this from Everest
Fernandez.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a YouTube channel as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to actually link the video below
where I learned this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, this chemical reaction is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not useful for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that full description on why
that's the case, I will link his video in
[SPEAKER_00]: the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead of doing that, what you are
supposed to do is actually dilute it
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people aren't doing this,
I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd make a quick video on how
to dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really just all you need is a small cup
of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the size that I use, which is
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pour a decent amount up because you really
want to, when you're diluting it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't want to have a too small of a
glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: A small shot glass isn't really going to
be enough to dilute it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put a little bit more in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of just guesstimate on how much
I'm going to need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really adjusts depending on how much
you're trying to bring your pH up or down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you're supposed to dilute it here
like I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, well actually let me
get rid of this other cloud first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did this go up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that went from 6.2 up to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now let's see if this small container
that I just mixed up is going to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: it up to about 6.5 is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it goes up a little bit more than that,
I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't see the gray cloud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh crap, I stirred it before I could show
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no gray cloud because it was
diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I am up to about 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 6.5, we'll see if that goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it got me up to where I need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But moral of the story, just wanted to
make a quick video today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urging you guys to dilute your pH up,
pH down before mixing it with your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient solution because a chemical
reaction happens and that is bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you guys next time.
