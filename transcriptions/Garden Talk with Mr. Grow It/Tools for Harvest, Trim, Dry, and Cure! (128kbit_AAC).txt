[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grote and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: back with another video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple people reach out to me
recently they're either in the harvesting
[SPEAKER_00]: process, drying process, trimming process,
or curing process and they didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: tools needed to do the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this video I figured I would show
you some of the tools I use right here you
[SPEAKER_00]: can see all the tools that I have actually
I don't know if the camera is cutting that
[SPEAKER_00]: off or not but I have a lot of the tools
needed for the processes laid out right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll go over them in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get to the episode I'd like
to give a quick shout out to our sponsor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mars Hydro for sponsoring this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro currently has a summer sale
going on and there are several items on
[SPEAKER_00]: sale such as grow lights, grow tents,
and grow tank kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prices are already decreased on their
website and you can stack my discount code
[SPEAKER_00]: MRGROWIT on top of it to save more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stock is limited so when they sell out the
sale will end.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website link and discount code are on
the bottom right hand corner of the screen
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll also provide this information
down in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright so getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things to look at is
harvesting or pre-harvest actually before
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvest the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use a tool to check the color
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now of course this is going to depend on
which plant you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some plants that have resin
glands that have different colors and they
[SPEAKER_00]: need a microscope in order to look at the
color of those resin glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now fortunately these days this will do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Pixel 5 smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: All you have to do really is take a
picture of the plant close up then zoom
[SPEAKER_00]: into that picture and you're actually able
to see the colors of the resin glands.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people instead what they'll do is
they will buy something such as a
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one right here is a jeweler's loop
actually and it is LED so there is an LED
[SPEAKER_00]: button on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two different I think it's a 10x
and a 30x I believe for this one but the
[SPEAKER_00]: LED light comes on and then you basically
just kind of hold it towards the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you kind of look in and get a view on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now unfortunately with this type of tool
if you have a shaky hand it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people reach out to me in the
past and say their hand is too shaky and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't get a clear view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your hand is shaky you might not
want one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Side note on this this is also used to
inspect plants for pests for example
[SPEAKER_00]: really good tool for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a jeweler's loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several different brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this one right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by Vivo Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of very similar kind of pulls out
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like the LED automatically goes in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a 30x, 60x, and a 90x on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way I'll link all the tools that I
show in this video down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below so you can easily click on
that to get to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again for this one if you have a shaky
hand it might not be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not be able to get that clear
view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one right here is another
alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the one that I personally like to
use when I am using a microscope and this
[SPEAKER_00]: one has really meant more for to be placed
onto a table right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a flat surface place it right down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get that clear steady view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe this one is a 30 to 60x if I'm
not mistaken and you can kind of adjust it
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a button for LED as well so you
can get a clear view.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically you'd be snipping off a
piece of the plant placing onto a table
[SPEAKER_00]: and then placing the microscope over it
and then adjusting that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now downside is of course you have to clip
off a piece of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again if you have shaky hands the
other options aren't there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing if you do have a
smartphone you could get a Happy Hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: Nugshot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a few different lenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alone it is the macro lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Underneath that this is the wide angle
lens and then you've got the fisheye lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again you're going to need a steady view
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you do clip this onto your
smartphone you may actually want to put
[SPEAKER_00]: your phone onto a tripod and then you'll
be able to get a steady clear view on that
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much pre-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we actually get into harvesting the
plant, cutting down the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main tool I use for that are garden
shears.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are by Vivosun and they're
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a real thick stalk you need to
cut through these ones will get right
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually use these shears for I have
palm trees outside that are small height
[SPEAKER_00]: and I am able to cut through the palm tree
leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get multiple uses out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just growing my indoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also can trim outdoor plants with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did actually have a cheap Chinese
brand of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a red handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget the name brand on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was like 11 bucks on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did actually malfunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It ended up breaking in this area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to throw those away.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones I've had for let's see a year
and a half now and they've been working
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no complaints there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other alternative to cutting down your
plant a lot of people will use just
[SPEAKER_00]: regular trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: These spring loaded trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have real thick stalk though you're
going to have to spend some muscle working
[SPEAKER_00]: on to get in through there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some stocks might be so thick
that you can't even get through it with
[SPEAKER_00]: these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't use these anymore to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean if you're cutting individual
branches you could probably get through
[SPEAKER_00]: them a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah if you're trying to cut that main
stock it can be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I recommend the shears over
these ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are so many different companies
that make these spring loaded ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have one by Hydrofarm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vivosun they have one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all pretty much the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones I like the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe Happy Hydro now has titanium
blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's supposed to help with either
cleaning it I believe is easier or less
[SPEAKER_00]: gunk up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that kind of gunks up
your trimmers there will be less chances
[SPEAKER_00]: with the titanium blade.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually these ones are the titanium blade
I can see right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those three that I just showed you are
straight tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have these AC Infinity ones which I
haven't even taken out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't really tell you the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seem pretty standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how the blade holds up on
these but these are new.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is one of those up and coming
companies that produce real quality
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited to use those for the first
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the ones I just showed you are
straight tip trimmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have I'm not sure if you can see
this real well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a curved tip trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is by Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can kind of get in you know on some
flowers that you're trimming kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: having this curved tip can be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I'll use these but for the
most part I'm just using the straight tip
[SPEAKER_00]: ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one downside to all the spring loaded
ones I just showed you is you know if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trimming for several hours it can
cause strain on your hand unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's good that when you're releasing
it's less stress there but when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing in there's definitely some strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have kind of shied away from
these in recent harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually not recent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the past couple years or so I really
go towards these ones right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are by Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no spring on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really a lot less strain in my
opinion than the spring loaded ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another option for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're trimming I like to use gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are just standard gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are by Vivo Sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they even make these anymore
but there are some that are very very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones I can use harvest after
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some people out there
that prefer the disposable ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like the latex disposable gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way once you're done trimming you
just throw them away and then you get a
[SPEAKER_00]: new pair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I personally like to reuse where I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these ones have been pretty good
over the last few harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting into drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different drying
environments that you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are now tents specifically for
drying with drying racks built in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people just use their grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will use their bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use cardboard boxes to dry and
they'll basically just hang them on coat
[SPEAKER_00]: hangers for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll just either clip them on to a coat
hanger or yeah whatever they can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: A string across the box and then hanging
on the string.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are creative ways that you can
create a dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A drying rack is something that folks
often use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have one here to show you but I'll
put one on the screen right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is by Happy Hydro and I believe
these come in several different layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the downside with these racks from my
experience I have used them in the past is
[SPEAKER_00]: that some flowers you know can kind of
sink in if you keep them on one side.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rotating them has been kind of
beneficial for me at least in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So drying rack is an alternative compared
to just hanging them on coat hangers for
[SPEAKER_00]: example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes the dry environment needs to be
controlled humidity wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally live in a very dry climate so
I will use a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you can see that
humidifier right there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a humidifier I've been using for
the past six months I think eight months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a smart humidifier and that one is
actually app controlled as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know you download an app on your
phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can turn it on off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can adjust the humidity percent set
point through the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll tell you when the water is out and
needs to be refilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll tell you when it needs to be
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm actually really loving that
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I bought three of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my grow tents and lung room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take it and I use it in my dry
environment as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different humidifiers
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the one that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on the flip side if your environment
is too humid and you need to reduce the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity a dehumidifier would be what you
use for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again I live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually never needed to use a
dehumidifier but I'll link one down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the bottom of the dry environment I
like to put an oscillating fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a small eight inch one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put it on the ground and let it blow
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there's some air movement within
the dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also a clip-on option that clips on
directly to the side of a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example a pole of a grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that one down below as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then monitoring the temperature and
humidity in your dry environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several different temperature and
humidity monitors out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's an Accu-Rite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this was like 10 bucks,
11 bucks on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna tell you the temperature,
humidity, and then the high and low values
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past 36 hours if I remember
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The downside to this is if you have this
in your dry environment you need to open
[SPEAKER_00]: up the environment in order to see what
the levels are at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could disturb your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example I'm in the dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I have a humidifier in there it
raises it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I open up my dry environment well
that escapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lowers the humidity so then closing it
back up and needs to raise back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit disturbance in the
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now is that going to ruin your flowers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But still there is an alternative option
which is what I use is the sensor push
[SPEAKER_00]: wireless temperature humidity monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually going to do
temperature, humidity, VPD, and it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually does dew point as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use this in my garden while my plants
are growing and then I also transfer it
[SPEAKER_00]: over to my dry environment and monitor the
temperature and humidity in my dry
[SPEAKER_00]: environment with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just Bluetooth but there is a
Wi-Fi adapter that you can connect to so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see the temperature and humidity
wherever you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this hooks up directly to your
smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is an app that you download and
it gives you historical data as well so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can see what the temperature and
humidity was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of a line graph up and down,
up and down for the past hour,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the past day, the past week,
for the past month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do certain set points.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll give you alerts, notifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your humidity is too low you'll get
an alert on your smartphone that you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to take action.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing humidity is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get alerted and you would be able to
take action from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also I have set points for the
temperature, VPD, dew point, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using this for four years now
roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other monitors on the market
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pulse has a monitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have the pulse monitor as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been trying it out for the past
several months now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do actually prefer the sensor push over
the regular pulse monitor though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly due to the actual app just working
better in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right on to curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get your standard mason jar here
for curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still use a glass mason jar for curing.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it's airtight sealed that's a
good curing container.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 32 ounce wide mouth,
wide mouth specifically so you can stick
[SPEAKER_00]: your hand in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to hold about an ounce of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the density of the flowers
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have real dense flowers for
example it could look like it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: three fourths full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe even a little bit less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more airier flowers less dense
stuff it could actually fill this up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might potentially even need another
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people use these with
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: The alternative to that there's so many
different alternatives to this as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: curing containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that I use in particular is the
C-Volt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got the C-Volt right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These things are kind of clip down
airtight seal all across.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing I really like about these is
if you have a lot right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe this size right here is going
to be able to easily store three to four
[SPEAKER_00]: ounces of flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned the glass container is
going to do one ounce each roughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the curing process often times you're
doing a burping process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're moving the containers shaking it
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do it multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do it once a day so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have multiple ounces with the
glass jars you're going to have to open up
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple jars and it's a little bit of a
process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put three four ounces in one
container it's a much quicker process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just doing one burp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I harvest a whole plant for
example usually I get three to four ounces
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowers per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll just go in one container and then
there's just one burp that happens you
[SPEAKER_00]: know however many times a day it needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in these containers having some sort
of monitor in there is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use these ones right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get them super cheap on eBay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're like two bucks a piece
less than that on eBay depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity you buy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also on Amazon as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's some accuracy issues with some
of them that I've received.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you can actually calibrate them
but I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that I fully recommend this
one but there are digital ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one's not on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs batteries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The batteries it takes is the LR44s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two of them need to get the replace but it
would be a digital hygrometer and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to see what the humidity is and also
I believe in the bottom corners the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature as well and then you simply
place them in the jar or container that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using to cure and then you'll be
able to monitor the humidity of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much all the tools I have
here for harvest, dry, trim, and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think if I'm forgetting
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any tools that I didn't mention
that you use for those processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
