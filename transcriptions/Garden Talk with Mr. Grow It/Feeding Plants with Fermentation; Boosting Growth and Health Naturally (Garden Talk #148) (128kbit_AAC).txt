[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 148.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Luna Wickham.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been on the podcast once before,
episode 111, where she talked all about
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you can do in order to
increase plant taste and smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that she mentioned in
that episode is that she uses ferments,
[SPEAKER_00]: which prompted some of you to comment on
that video requesting more details.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a ton of knowledge on this,
so in this episode we get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talks about the different types of
fermentation and how you can implement in
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back and I'm joined with Luna
Whitcomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, how are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for having me back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, second time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got real deep into things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the more advanced growers,
I'd say, of just advanced knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had a lot of folks here that tuned
in and they were just blown away by all
[SPEAKER_00]: the knowledge that you dropped that time
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they wanted you back for a second
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are for part two.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go a little bit deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give the people what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to talk all about
fermentation for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I think of fermentation,
I think a lot of people think of KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think of the fermented plant juice,
fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot more to it than just
those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get deep
into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have certain ferments that you
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So finding out what you do, when you apply
them, how you make them, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll cram that into this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see how far we can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that should be it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a very knowledgeable,
packed episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just introduce yourself for those
that didn't catch the first episode we did
[SPEAKER_00]: together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Luna Wickham.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a educator in the kind of living soil
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do soil mineral balancing consulting.
[SPEAKER_02]: On my Instagram, I share a lot of
different recipes, like the ones we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be talking about today and
different approaches to things and how you
[SPEAKER_02]: can up your game and up your soil health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your plants, a volatile organic compound
profile, which is just the smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Make things smell better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your yields up, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I breed different types of seeds and stuff
and genetics that I like to work on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing that for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been cultivating for about 16 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is my passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil and plants are my passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I mentioned, we did do one
episode together in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have that linked in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can after this episode,
you can click on that one and go tune into
[SPEAKER_00]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get let's get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much to know about
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you mentioned a couple of like KNF
inputs, FPJ, you know, fermented plant
[SPEAKER_02]: juice, fermented fruit juice and stuff
like that, which is like a mixture of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's just any kind of high osmotic
pressure input that will pull the juices
[SPEAKER_02]: out of plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they leave it open.
[SPEAKER_02]: You leave it open like a coffee filter and
it'll collect, you know, microbes specific
[SPEAKER_02]: to that profile of compounds inside of the
organic matter in that juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like different enzymes and amino acids
and carbohydrates will attract specific
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes that, you know, want to live in
that environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll collect, you know, microbes
specific to that plant matter and will
[SPEAKER_02]: help break it down, make available.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what makes it a fermentation,
because a fermentation is just a
[SPEAKER_02]: biological breakdown or changing from one
compound to another through biology in
[SPEAKER_02]: plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a whole bunch of different
types of fermentations out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you mentioned the FPJ, the FFJ and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an osmotic fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but we also have solid state
fermentation, which is like bukkashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you take a dry bran and you add
lactobacillus to it, we can get into the
[SPEAKER_02]: details of how to make that stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also anaerobic fermentation,
which is usually used with lactobacillus,
[SPEAKER_02]: lactic acid, bacteriocerem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's also added to to plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can add different inputs like
calcium and amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's, you know, an aerobic
fermentation, which people often call
[SPEAKER_02]: compost teas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think compost tea is kind of a it's
the very, very widespread term used for
[SPEAKER_02]: for making them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're they're just like aerobic
fermentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's a more accurate
way of describing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I'd love to break down each
different category and like how to make
[SPEAKER_02]: them and how I like to approach it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where would you like to start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one should we kind of begin with?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the foundation for a lot of them is
going to be making lactic acid,
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteriocerem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a practice taught in the
Korean natural farming world.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's actually goes back way before
that way, way earlier than Korea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to Japan and even,
you know, and to Greece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a practice that was used all
over the world almost simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like everyone, everyone did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: In different areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say that it really came from
one specific place, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's essentially when milk will be
inoculated with lactobacillus and it
[SPEAKER_02]: separates and you get a cheese curd and
then you're left with the serum beneath
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that serum is a potent probiotic
source of lactobacillus, a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was then used to add to crops to
boost health.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prevent pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a property called competitive
exclusion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very good at competitive exclusion,
which means that it will multiply very
[SPEAKER_02]: voraciously and exclude, outcompete
different pathogens and other microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: that might be pathogenic or infect your
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it was very commonly used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is this is like how cheese is
made, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so anywhere that they were
making cheese, they were making lactic
[SPEAKER_02]: acid, bacteriocerem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that byproduct was used as a
fertilizer to fertilize crops and then to
[SPEAKER_02]: promote nutrient cycling, to prevent
pathogenic growth in the crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was used all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just an ancient practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: For short, people call it lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break down the steps on how to make it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how it's taught in Korean natural
farming is you collect rice wash,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is just starch that comes off of
rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, you can use any kind of
carbohydrate source that will attract
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes from the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to just go through the Korean
natural farming process because it's the
[SPEAKER_02]: standard way to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in an area where you really
insist on not going out and purchasing
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, you can use any carbohydrate,
you know, that might be growing in your
[SPEAKER_02]: field or that's just local to your area,
because that's what you prefer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take rice, you take rice.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I like to do is I like to soak it
overnight to really get all that starch
[SPEAKER_02]: softened off of it and shake it real good
inside of a jar, probably like 50 percent
[SPEAKER_02]: volume of your jar and then the rest
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you shake it up real good after about
24 hours and we'll get all that starch off
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you filter the rice out and
you're left with the rice wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with that rice wash, you set it
out in an area.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can do it in their house.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do it, you know, in a cupboard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't recommend that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest you find a place outside
underneath like a covered like with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: little canopy, like bush bushes or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cover it with like a coffee filter or a
paper towel, a rubber band over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you don't have any any wildlife or
rodents that get into it, but put it in an
[SPEAKER_02]: area where local microbes are going to be
existing, you know, where you see that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's healthy plant life.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Set it out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it takes only about 24 hours,
but you wait until you see a thin film
[SPEAKER_02]: that collects on the surface of the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a whole bunch of bacteria that
starts to grow on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that now it's a source of
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to be just
lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be everything in your
environment that's attracted to that
[SPEAKER_02]: carbohydrate and that profile of of
enzymes and carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's enough lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is we introduce it to a
lactic acid environment to promote only
[SPEAKER_02]: lactic acid bacteria to multiply.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for, you know, this example is is
milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people use milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to get, you know, if you're really
bougie and you want to make like the best,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best stuff, find some like local cream
top, which will usually separate on its
[SPEAKER_02]: own.
[SPEAKER_02]: But adding more microbes to it just makes
it that much better.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely use any kind of milk
that you get from the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, two percent, you know,
whole milk, whatever you can use,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you have on hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting something local is going to be
super ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you take one part your rice wash and
you add it to ten parts milk.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to use a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're making a whole bunch,
you can use like a 30 gallon barrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's enough for a whole field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mix it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're also going to cover that with like
a paper towel or some kind of mesh,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes, I just put the lid of the
bucket on top of it, but I don't seal it
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's going to off gas CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't want to create a bunch of
pressure inside the bucket and have it
[SPEAKER_02]: explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't seal it, but I just keep it
kind of breathing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after about two to three days,
you'll see it separate and you'll have a
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese curd on top.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice and thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just cut it into pieces or into like a
paint strainer bag or something like put a
[SPEAKER_02]: paint strainer bag in another five gallon
bucket, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pour everything in there and then you just
lift that cheese curd out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's cheese.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can press it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make cheese with it and flavor it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're left with the lack that
we're left with the lactic acid bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's that's the staple
for the rest of the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: That we're going to be talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it raw.
[SPEAKER_02]: People use it at three point five
milliliters per gallon or a ratio of one
[SPEAKER_02]: to one thousand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little stinky, but you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good for your gut health.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that allows us to make fermented plant
extracts that allows us to make solid
[SPEAKER_02]: state fermentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can add it to things like
composties or aerobic fermentations as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you mentioned that dilution rate
one to a thousand or three point five
[SPEAKER_00]: milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to dilute it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to, you know, some people
use it as a foliar, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, soil drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that happening?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely use it as a foliar
spray and induce introduce native biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: native lactobacillus species onto the leaf
surface of your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be the correct dilution for
that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the proper, you know, dose would be
like three point eight seven five or
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But three point five is just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use a foliar spray
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it as a soil drench.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend doing both.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really good for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just having it added to your foliar
spray routine is really great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And adding it to your soil drench soil
drench regimen is also really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I suggest using it about once a week,
though, I wouldn't push it to every time
[SPEAKER_02]: you water because it can be very
voracious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned, it's opportunistic.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to, like, maintain maximum
diversity of biology in our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't want to overuse lactic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bacteria serum.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I heard that you can even drink this
straight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even need to dilute it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just drink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true or no?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can you can definitely do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you if you're like,
you know, you're really into that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and you want to, you know,
you don't mind the the very pungent smell
[SPEAKER_02]: and taste to your you can absolutely do
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also delete it down to,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, humans, we secrete lactic acid and
so oftentimes on our bodies, we collect
[SPEAKER_02]: lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the smell is very similar to body
odor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you could put that in your mouth if
you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to get into you mentioned Bokashi
composting next or Bokashi that as being a
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I'm actually in the
process of getting into.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm super intrigued by this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Break that down for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Bokashi is a solid state fermentation
of any grain carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that means is it's not suspended
in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we add a little bit of water to
make it moist, spread the lactobacillus
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the substrate, throughout the
media, like whatever grain carbohydrate we
[SPEAKER_02]: choose, which can be wheat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be oats.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: A whole bunch of different things,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be rice itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And essentially what it does is it is an
introduction of moocore, but it's also an
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction of lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it helps break down and compost things
on the surface of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you add Bokashi to the top of your
soil, most of the nutrient cycling that's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in soil is happening in like the
first six to eight inches of the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you add a very, very potent
inoculant, like Bokashi, it really helps
[SPEAKER_02]: with the nutrient cycling in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's like a filamentous hyphae
that comes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a lot of debate about what it
is, but there has been confirmation
[SPEAKER_02]: through different doctors recently that it
is moocore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is something that I've talked
about in the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the Rhizopus family.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what moocore does is it's in every
single soil and it plays a very crucial
[SPEAKER_02]: role in decomposition of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has the potential to create
symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mycorrhizae kind of attaches to the
root zone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It spreads out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It expands the surface area, allowing for
more of the soil to be accessed by the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant, therefore more nutrients to be
uptaken.
[SPEAKER_02]: The moocore will form a symbiotic
relationship with that mycorrhizae also
[SPEAKER_02]: and just extend that reach and that
surface area even further.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it like multiplies the potential for
nutrients to be absorbed by the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into the process of like how
to make it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll take your green carbohydrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll take your lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll dilute your lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually like to do 15 milliliters per
gallon of the raw lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're using activated
lactobacillus, which we can get into in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit, it would be about 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is like what your FBE would be or
your AEM, your activated effective
[SPEAKER_02]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dilute it to about 15 milliliters per
gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you, if you want it to be just
super simple, you can take your grain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mix it just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix it to what's called field capacity
to where it's moist, but it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: dripping.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like the maximum amount of
water it can hold without runoff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mix it very thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You remove all the oxygen from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people, I like to just put it in a
trash bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that's the simplest approach.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just throw it all in the trash bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You collapse all the gear out of it and
you tie it and then it's going to fill up
[SPEAKER_02]: with air with carbon dioxide because it's
off gassing a lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after three weeks it's finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dry it and then you use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very simple to make and it's very
effective in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that I have been looking
into and there's recipes all over online.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the ones I actually
pulled up here, it has you start with 10
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds of bran.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I do research, where do you
get it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get it at local feed stores and get
it pretty cheap too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get like huge like 50 pound
bags for pretty cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's usually where people start out
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figured I'd mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also mentioned using lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the recipes call for EM1,
which would kind of be a replacement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say you could use either or in
that case or what?
[SPEAKER_02]: So EM1 is a product made by Tarigenics and
it is a lactobacillus ferment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So EM1, it has other, it's a consortium,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has mostly lactobacillus in it,
but it has other things like purple
[SPEAKER_02]: non-sulfur bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has some yeast in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has some other stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely use EM1.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a little bit more
expensive route.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make your own and it's
significantly cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you'd like to go that route and you
don't want to bother with the risk of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, maybe messing something up or
the frustration of not having a successful
[SPEAKER_02]: culture, you can absolutely go out and get
EM1.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also some other things
listed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got like, you added molasses and
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can use molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just like a sugar source.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also add different fermentations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you had some FPJ,
some fermented plant juice that you wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could add some of that as a food
source.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, you could use an FPE that you've
used this lactobacillus culture to break
[SPEAKER_02]: down different organic matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use different polysaccharide
sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these polysaccharides are just complex
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I like to do is I'll add
lactobacillus labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll add red beet juice, which has a very
potent polysaccharide called inulin in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is really like, lactobacillus loves
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great for lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to add red beet as my input.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add different food sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grain itself is a food source.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to really play with
getting different cultures of biology and
[SPEAKER_02]: having different expressions kind of
inside this bukkashi, you can definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: play with different food sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use fruit juice, vegetable juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people use carrot, beet,
aloe vera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are kind of just different
things that you can play with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those ratios are going to be different
depending on what you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: using.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to get too much into the
specifics of that because I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: lead anyone astray because if you use
multiple inputs, those ratios are all
[SPEAKER_02]: going to change as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using a food source like that is a good
practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just the simplest form is just
bukkashi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just the simplest form is bukkashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But just the simplest form is bukkashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the sunlight can damage the
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just let it dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to be using all of it
right away, you don't have to let it dry
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just kind of like powder it up
real good and just toss it right on the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface of the garden or the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want it to be too thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just like dusting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just want it to be spread kind of
evenly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want like a layer of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've applied it to the point that
it's like a cake, you've added too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also what I like to do if I do add a
bunch is I'll scratch it into the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface to kind of break it up because it
can create a thick layer that can dry and
[SPEAKER_02]: then prevent oxygen going back into your
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to apply too much because
then it can create other problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also don't add it to the stems,
like around the stems of the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if the plant is younger and it
hasn't kind of developed its strength,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can add this strong microbial
inoculants that's intended to break down
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter to your stem and it'll just
break down the stem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't add it to the base of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep like three, four to five inches,
you know, like a little donut around the
[SPEAKER_02]: base of the plant, ideally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how often would you apply?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you only apply it during a certain
stage of the plant's growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, flowering versus veg or is it
good throughout the whole life cycle?
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally like to do it through bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind this is a potent microbe
source, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any kind of testing that
you need to keep your microbial counts
[SPEAKER_02]: down, if you add this blooming,
you know, filamentous kind of like fungi
[SPEAKER_02]: to your surface, you're creating all these
spores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each little head has all these spores
inside of it and they'll fly around,
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll get everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if that's a concern to you,
I definitely wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to keep it in like my vegetative
growth stages or early flowering and then
[SPEAKER_02]: cut it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some people wouldn't agree with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can imagine some commercial
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they test for microbials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, like you mentioned,
if you use it in flower, it could
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially, they send out that for
testing and they could potentially fail
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they have to throw away that
batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely get your reasoning for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are allergic to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're very sensitive to the spores being
in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're one of those people who's
sensitive to spores being in the air,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably a practice thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the Bokashi brand, after you make
it, you can take that and not just apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the soil, like you mentioned,
but do a process called Bokashi
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I'd like to get into that if
you've got knowledge on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to start with
kind of maybe how you make a Bokashi bin
[SPEAKER_00]: and then kind of using the Bokashi brand
on the food scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, we can talk about that for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is definitely like a non-traditional
way of composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it won't actually break the plant
matter down, like into a moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: into like a black substance, like you
would usually see doing like thermophilic
[SPEAKER_02]: composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost like pickles it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like kind of keeps it in this like pickled
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it's taken out of the bin and you
throw it in like a regular compost bin or
[SPEAKER_02]: on your soil surface, it'll break down
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this, this controlled state in the
Bokashi bin, it won't actually break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes people see that and they
take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your bin is essentially a bucket or any
vessel that has like a spout on the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the technique is you put down a layer
of Bokashi at the bottom of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add a layer of your organic matter,
usually like chicken scraps, kitchen,
[SPEAKER_02]: kitchen scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you cover that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Bokashi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what it does, it'll create what's
called lechette, which it'll kind of break
[SPEAKER_02]: it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll create this juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that juice is very, very potent
nutrient source that you can then add to
[SPEAKER_02]: your water and feed to your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add it to compost seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rich in biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rich in nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you essentially repeat that process of
adding a layer of organic matter,
[SPEAKER_02]: of plant matter, adding a layer of
Bokashi, doing it over and over and over
[SPEAKER_02]: and over again until you fill your vessel
and you let it break down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'd let it kind of sit for like
three weeks or so until you get all that
[SPEAKER_02]: leached out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can even press it down to get more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then what you're left with is plant
matter that's still rich in organic
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, still rich in nutrient content.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you would break that up and top dress
with it and it'll break down very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really great for your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You also don't want to make that too thick
because it can create too thick of a layer
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll prevent oxygen from penetrating
into the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can add it to a regular compost bin
and compost it and it'll compost very
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, I'm just kind of getting
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have the five gallon bucket and I
also bought it's actually used for car
[SPEAKER_00]: wash bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to get like a dirt trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically you put it in the bottom of the
bucket, but it adds in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way the liquid can kind of be down
on that bottom part and spout on the side,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then food scraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can put bones in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put meat in there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All sorts of food you can put within there
as long as you're putting the brand on
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least that's my understanding of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I plan to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, I would personally avoid animal
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it, is there a specific reason?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a fan of flesh in compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just, you're playing with,
when you start playing with breaking down
[SPEAKER_02]: flesh and like cell and like animal tissue
and stuff like that, you're attracting
[SPEAKER_02]: biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be breaking down flesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not often time a good thing to
have around us as animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can, it can bring in passages and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And while lactobacillus by nature is very
competitive, like it can out-compete
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the potential is much lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The possibility is still there,
especially if you make a mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I don't recommend using flesh and
bones and stuff like that, because God
[SPEAKER_02]: forbid you get something that makes you
very sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you recommend for somebody
who is looking to like reuse food scraps
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of things would you add in there
safely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Food waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your lettuce, tomato, your plant matter,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trimming things off of your
plants, if you have plant matter that
[SPEAKER_02]: you've defoliated or that you've pruned
the bottoms off of, that stuff is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or like the butts of whatever vegetables
that you're not using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetables, fruits and vegetables.
[SPEAKER_02]: Scraps is what I recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about like bread or French fries or
things like that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would stay away from anything that's
been like really heavily treated with
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's going to limit the
microbial activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can definitely add carbohydrates for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think most ideally is going to be
fruits and vegetable scraps.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want the bang for your buck,
I would go that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that liquid that you mentioned
that you would eventually go down and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got the spout there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're draining it from the bucket
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that need to be diluted before doing
the application to the plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: One ounce per gallon is perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One ounce per gallon, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't go any higher than that
honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty potent stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go lower than that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do want to use things more,
decrease the dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to increase the frequency,
decrease the dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Increase frequency, decrease dosage.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do want to use it in every
watering, you can drop it down to like
[SPEAKER_02]: three milliliters and go like that because
it's decent and it's not going to be as
[SPEAKER_02]: potent as a lactobacillus source as
straight lactic acid bacteria serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of an okay practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do about once a week,
once every two weeks, you can go up to
[SPEAKER_02]: about 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you want to use it more,
you have like a deficiency you really want
[SPEAKER_02]: to correct quickly, I recommend smaller
dosages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would that be for a foliar as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or would you only recommend a soil drench
with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You could use it as a foliar application.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would definitely drop the foliar
application down a little bit lower too,
[SPEAKER_02]: to about three to five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like you mentioned, that food
isn't going to break down entirely,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll press it down, get a liquid out,
and then you'll empty out that bucket
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of people are,
you know, put it in their backyard and
[SPEAKER_00]: then bury it down in a hole in their yard,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of the way I plan to use
it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 1% organic matter in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to, I'm trying to reuse my
scraps and I have a regular compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a vermer compost, but I want to
continue to do new things here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Bokashi really sparked my interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that you can't put in the
worm boom that you can actually do through
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's what interested me the
most is instead of just putting in the
[SPEAKER_00]: garbage for example, I can put it into
Bokashi composting and then eventually try
[SPEAKER_00]: to build up the organic matter that's in
my backyard and be growing some fruits and
[SPEAKER_00]: veggies out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do feed it to your worm bins,
the worms will eat it much faster too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really good for the worm,
like that health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you take it from Bokashi composting,
big clumps, put it into a worm bin,
[SPEAKER_00]: it breaks it down even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get the worm castings in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would create a very high quality
earthworm casting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you said Bokashi can do some things
that traditional composting can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you had mentioned using meat and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of wanted to just take a little
detour and kind of discuss ways of
[SPEAKER_02]: composting meat because I know that that's
a big thing for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So black soldier fly larva and beetles are
a great way to break down flesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have a lot of food waste,
let's say you're on a farm and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: animals, you're a hunter and you have a
lot of flesh, whatever, that would just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, that you're not going to be using
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can create a black soldier fly larva
bin, which are just like a species of fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they consume the flesh very,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll consume the flesh very,
very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then their excrement is used as a
nutrient source and biological inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you throwing that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next up, you had mentioned an aerobic
form would be compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get into that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're going to tie everything back
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we can use all the inputs that we
discussed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, the osmotic fermentation,
the anaerobic fermentation, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: actually know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should back up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to FPE.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause we can talk about using,
um, labs and like molasses and food
[SPEAKER_02]: sources to then ferment into an FPE.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can use that as like an input
and kind of wrap it all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into FPE.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we talked about lactobacillus,
um, fermentation, um, as a biological
[SPEAKER_02]: inoculant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but we can also use it just like when
we do bukkashi buckets to break down
[SPEAKER_02]: organic matter, to create available
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is also considered a solid state
fermentation, but we can also do an
[SPEAKER_02]: anaerobic fermentation in water with
lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: To create what's called a fermented plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what this is, is we collect plant
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Typically, typically, you know,
people will go out and they'll collect
[SPEAKER_02]: like fallen fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what I like to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to go collect fallen fruit,
peaches and apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also like to use kind of like,
um, um, gourds, you know, I'll use like
[SPEAKER_02]: pumpkin and squash and, and the melons and
stuff like that, which have a lot of sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: inside of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have a wide diversity,
you know, between all the things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned, including beets.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a wide diversity of
polysaccharides, which are different food
[SPEAKER_02]: sources, different complex carbohydrates,
which will contribute, um, different
[SPEAKER_02]: organic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each organic acid, you know,
found in all of this diversity of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: matter, we have diversity of
polysaccharides, we have diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: organic acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: These organic acids will act as,
um, like plant stimulants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they act as phytohormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And each organic acid will stimulate
different processes in the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: which can, which is a whole other
wormhole.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have things like chasmonic acid,
which is the stress response hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have oxens, we have gibberellins,
we have cytokinins, um, which will all
[SPEAKER_02]: trigger different physiological effects
inside of plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we add a whole different array of plant
matter to water and we let it soak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll pull those organic acids out and
adding the lactobacillus will keep
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens from multiplying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll also help break down that organic
matter and release those organic acids as
[SPEAKER_02]: well as release the nutrients inside of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do is we take the plants and
the waste that we have around us and we
[SPEAKER_02]: introduce it into water and lactobacillus
and let it ferment either with just the
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar sources that exist inside of the
plant matter, or we can add a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of molasses also if we don't think we have
enough sugar sources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this gives us a very potent fertilizer
that we can then dilute and add to our
[SPEAKER_02]: garden regimen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also is a source of phytohormones
that we can then use to stimulate growth
[SPEAKER_02]: processes and we can tailor the plant
inputs used to have specific organic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles to stimulate different growth
processes in the plant during the time
[SPEAKER_02]: that it's needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these different phytohormones will have
benefits for different plant growth
[SPEAKER_02]: processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, like gibberellin is good for
germination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cytokinin is going to be good for like
that transition stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ethylene is going to be good for like
finishing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be good for your ripening
stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can use resources online to look
up different organic acid profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good one is called Dr. Duke's
phytochemical database.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can punch that into Google and you
enter your plant into the search bar and
[SPEAKER_02]: it'll give you a full breakdown of your
phytochemicals that exist inside of that
[SPEAKER_02]: plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can determine what we have in
the plant that will stimulate which growth
[SPEAKER_02]: process in the garden that we're looking
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: This can be kind of arduous because it's
going to give you a list of like these
[SPEAKER_02]: organic acids that you may not know what
they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can like filter it by PPM and then
you can look up, you know, the most potent
[SPEAKER_02]: sources in that plant to know like when I
give this to my plant, when I harness
[SPEAKER_02]: these organic acids, it can promote
certain growth processes in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I really, really like to
play with when making fermented plant
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like creating certain brews that are
going to accomplish certain tasks and have
[SPEAKER_02]: specific profiles of nutrients that will
complement certain growth processes in our
[SPEAKER_02]: garden as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we have a plant that needs a
particular amount of potassium at a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain growth stage or phosphorus at
another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can tailor our fermentations for
vegetative, early flowering, mid
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering, late flowering to help
facilitate that growth process in our
[SPEAKER_02]: garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ultimately replacing a lot of products
that, you know, are out there on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not all of them though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so fermented plant extracts correct
me if I'm wrong here, but what falls under
[SPEAKER_00]: that is fermented plant juice,
fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, it doesn't actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So fermented plant juice is a osmotic
extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: With like a sugar source, something that
has a high osmotic pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not use lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to blend it to, you know,
keep the surface area, like as much
[SPEAKER_02]: surface area as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plant matter, fill like, I like to make 55
gallon barrels of this, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fill it a third to a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're bold and you're really patient,
you have a lot you can do like three
[SPEAKER_02]: quarters.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think like a third to a half is
pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you add your lactic acid bacteria
serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ratio is one to one to 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you add one part lactic acid bacteria
serum, one part your food source,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then 20 parts water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a lot of sugar in your
plant matter, you might want to tone down
[SPEAKER_02]: like how much molasses that you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a lot of sugar, you can skip
it completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what I typically do, is I'll fill
it with a whole bunch of plant matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like using aloe vera, I like using beet,
you know, cantaloupe, squash, pumpkin,
[SPEAKER_02]: premature apples, you know, stuff that I
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Blend it all up, add it to this vessel,
which I actually have a video on this on
[SPEAKER_02]: my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about making a fermented plant
extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add your one part lactobacillus to
your one part food source to your 20 parts
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's say you have a 55 gallon barrel,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we're just going to do it right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a 55 gallon barrel,
that's 213,125 milliliters, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we divide that by we have 22 parts
total, we know we need about three gallons
[SPEAKER_02]: of lactic acid bacteria serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit less, about two and two
thirds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would add two and two thirds,
two and a half gallons of lactic acid
[SPEAKER_02]: bacteria serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we have the volume equal to that in
plant matter, probably a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: because, you know, it's not all going to
be sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, maybe twice that amount in
volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would then just add water to fill it
all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're skipping the plant matter
completely, you would just add molasses
[SPEAKER_02]: and fill it up with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this creates a fermented AEM,
activated effective microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the plant matter, it is the
fermented plant extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: You fill it up to the top, you know,
you mix it nice and good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You cap it, you keep it anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have a little valve,
one of those little water valves,
[SPEAKER_02]: like bubble ones, like that are used in
fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: People use them in beer and wine and stuff
like that to off-gas CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: This also prevents oxygen from getting
into the culture because it is an
[SPEAKER_02]: anaerobic fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lactobacillus is technically called
facultative, which means it can survive in
[SPEAKER_02]: anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this situation, we want to keep it
anaerobic as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we cap it, we seal it, we add one of
those little air off-gassing bubble valve
[SPEAKER_02]: things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will let that sit for three weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we watch it, don't open it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it sit for three weeks, test it with a
pH pen, see what the pH is.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's between 3.2 and 3.7, it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will help us give an idea of how much
lactic acid is inside of the culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when that lactic acid concentration
reaches a certain level, it'll be within
[SPEAKER_02]: that range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we know that the bacteria,
the lactobacillus has really released
[SPEAKER_02]: enough lactic acid to reach a particular
concentration that we know that it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 3.5, it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anywhere between 3.2, 3.7, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't get it down that low.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It usually never gets lower than that,
though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to be careful when using plant
inputs that are alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't get your culture low enough,
the lactobacillus isn't going to thrive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a problem when people are using
the leaves of plants that they might
[SPEAKER_02]: defoliate the under part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: A common one that people do that with is
often very alkaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to accommodate for that,
we can use things like apple cider vinegar
[SPEAKER_02]: to drop that pH to about the 4.5 to 4
range.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it'll help facilitate the
multiplication of the lactobacillus
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is good to check the pH before you
start your culture and before you seal it,
[SPEAKER_02]: because if you're using plant matter that
is very alkaline, it's going to interrupt
[SPEAKER_02]: the functionality of the fermentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you open it up after three weeks,
pH is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a little shot glass of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There shouldn't be a pellicle,
which is like a collection of
[SPEAKER_02]: lactobacillus that's going to protect the
rest of the culture from oxygen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a thin film.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there isn't a pellicle, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It means that your barrel was completely
sealed and there was no air that got
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is a pellicle, it's not horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't represent a fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was oxygen that got in your
barrel, and that's just something to note.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a little shot glass, collect it,
set it out for a couple days, see how
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly that pellicle forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the pellicle doesn't form, it was a
fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't multiply lactobacillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it does, then that's a strong culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a way of determining the strength
and microbial density of
[SPEAKER_02]: lactobacillus-based products as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people sell FPEs.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people sell lactobacillus
cultures.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a microscope and you
want to see if this thing is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: viable and alive, take a shot glass of it
and leave it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it doesn't form a pellicle in a day or
two, it's weak.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quicker, the better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, it'll probably form something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're at seven days, that product
is inferior to something that you can make
[SPEAKER_02]: at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good thing to know about.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had a successful one, you got your
pellicle, you got it within the pH range,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is something that you would use
between 15 to 16 milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I typically use it just at 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use it as a foliar spray
application.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really want to get fancy with it,
you can get a refractometer and see how
[SPEAKER_02]: much sugar content is in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a lot of sugar left in your
culture, after those three weeks,
[SPEAKER_02]: you overfed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a huge, big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to create problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will if you're going to start
foliar spraying it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you foliar spray sugar onto your leaf
surface, you're going to start getting
[SPEAKER_02]: things like white flies or different pests
that are attracted to sugars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to not over-apply inputs
that have a lot of sugar in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do, you need to have a microbial
source along with it to help consume that
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you add too much sugar and you
foliar spray it on your plants,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to have some big issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to be mindful, it's better to
underfeed your cultures than overfeed
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't take notes fast enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much new information for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, I don't really do
ferments right now, but it is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that I hope to eventually get into in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm learning and I'm definitely going
to be watching this episode back and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking notes here in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said it's different than FPJ and
FFJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think now's a good time to get into
those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can discuss the differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of covered it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were there any specific questions or
things that you'd like to know about
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding them?
[SPEAKER_00]: With FPJ fermented plant juice,
you're really only using plants with the
[SPEAKER_00]: fermented fruit juice using fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use a combination of things was a
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, brown sugar I know is a thing that's
often used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend that to use for FPJ
and FFJ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brown sugar is like the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a standard, but it's anything
with like high osmotic pressure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was chatting with some of my nerd
friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about using dextrose
because it's the highest osmotic pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: like simple sugar out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it might pull out more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never actually done it, but anyway,
yes, I would use brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you do a one-to-one ratio by
volume, mix it up, kind of chop it,
[SPEAKER_02]: like masticate it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then mix it with your brown sugar at a
one-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people have changed the ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: KNF kind of is known for changing their
recipes over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one-to-one was what I was originally
taught and what I have been using,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it works just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they let that sit for about seven
days and then collect the juices that have
[SPEAKER_02]: separated, and they'll be sitting on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that you use at a
one-to-1,000 application rate also.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have a microbial storage
source when you're using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like I said, it's pretty much just
sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can use it like syrup.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to seal it up with like a
fermentation lid if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: making it for consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in KNF, people are using those
inputs with lactobacillus, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: also using what's called indigenous
microorganisms, which is just the name of
[SPEAKER_02]: the input, which is it's rice that has
been undercooked and left out in the
[SPEAKER_02]: forest to collect microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll form that filamentous hyphae layer,
like Bukashi will, like Mukor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The claims are that it's collecting
indigenous microorganisms and multiplying
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a practice that I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems to me that it's a method of
introducing Mukor and biology throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like to use Bukashi instead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's simpler.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, point being, you have to add a
microbial source to your fermented plant
[SPEAKER_02]: juices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to add sugars to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what they'll do is they'll add IMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll add FPJ.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll add brown rice vinegar as your
enzyme source.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have water-soluble calcium.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have like a whole range of things
that they use, and they use them together.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important that you have that
consortium of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your inoculant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your enzyme source.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your nutrient source.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your protectors.
[SPEAKER_02]: They call them the microbe police.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the lactic acid bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: They introduce it all together as this
complete picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: They recommend not using one alone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I recommend that also.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to be using something high
in sugar, you have to have microbes and
[SPEAKER_02]: enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That go along with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be brown rice vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be a little bit of apple cider
vinegar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of different enzyme
sources out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also use things like sprouted seed
teas, which are seeds that have been
[SPEAKER_02]: sprouted full of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You blend them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a very potent enzyme source.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add that too, but it's important
that you have biology, the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lactobacillus, and then your fermented
plant juice, your sugar source,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's just like straight sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: That can be problematic if used alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned several different KNF
processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a topic in itself, or episode
itself, I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a couple people on in the past that
were talking KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so fascinating the way everything
works together on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get super deep into that into a future
episode.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot to talk about around KNF.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we should stick to the fermentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would like to get into if I
think we have time here is the compost
[SPEAKER_00]: teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's right ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's wrong ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some people that say that you
shouldn't use them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's the question I ask you to
begin is this broad question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have folks who say they use compost
teas frequently and they gain a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: value out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got other people that say just use
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just top dress a compost and water it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing a tea isn't going to have any
additional benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top dress and compost, if the compost is
quality, is going to be a much safer way
[SPEAKER_02]: of introducing biology and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in its original form.
[SPEAKER_02]: You add the water, the microbes get
introduced, the nutrients are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes it very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where the problem comes in is if you have
a lot of soil, you need a lot of compost
[SPEAKER_02]: to cover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're growing in a field, you're
growing any significant amount of food and
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't have enough compost to do that,
compost teas are a great way to stretch
[SPEAKER_02]: that biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oftentimes, people don't take into
consideration that when we're making
[SPEAKER_02]: compost teas, we can also add other things
to the compost tea that wouldn't be
[SPEAKER_02]: present inside of a thermophilically
composted compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even a mesophilically composted like
insect grass or earthworm casting.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit earlier, I had mentioned
diversities of organic acids used as
[SPEAKER_02]: phytohormones to promote plant processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can add inputs that introduce those
organic acid profiles to our compost teas
[SPEAKER_02]: and make them more effective and more
readily available to our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can also use different inputs in our
compost teas to encourage microbes and
[SPEAKER_02]: microbial multiplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: All cells require amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: All proteins are formed through amino
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I like to do in my compost teas is
I'll add an amino acid source.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll add different diversities of complex
carbohydrates, of polysaccharides,
[SPEAKER_02]: to encourage diversity of biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compost teas are not the native
environment for soil biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, soil gets wet, but it does not
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you make compost teas, you're taking
biology out of its native environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're putting it in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to limit the diversity that
it can multiply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is very effective, but you're not
going to have the microbial diversity that
[SPEAKER_02]: you would get if you were to just top
dress it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But top dressing an acre is a huge task.
[SPEAKER_02]: Top dressing a half acre, quarter acre,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're trying to bioremediate a piece
of land, it's going to be very difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: and take many, many years to do
composting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally, in adding compost to the
soil surface, compost teas are a great way
[SPEAKER_02]: to just help kind of bridge that gap,
to add biology, to help cycle nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that they're just tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think to be like, oh, this tool is
just better than this tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that this tool has an application
specifically that's going to be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this tool has another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of these things that we're talking
about today, they're all just tools.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them are going to have
strengths and some of them are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: have weaknesses and some are not going to
be ideal in certain situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compost tea is just another one of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when making compost tea, people use
compost, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use thermophilic, which is going
to be your traditional turned compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use mesophilic, which is going to be
your earthworm castings or your insect
[SPEAKER_02]: grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have different profiles
because they are made through different
[SPEAKER_02]: processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is through the turning and heating up
of microbes that break down the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: matter into compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other is being consumed by insects and
going through their gut biome and using
[SPEAKER_02]: their excrement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer mesophilic breakdown,
mesophilic composting, because when it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't get to that higher temperature,
it isn't going to cook off other
[SPEAKER_02]: biological species that can't survive in
those temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them prefer acidic environments,
some more basic, some colder, some hotter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we heat them up, we're creating an
environment that those microbes that want
[SPEAKER_02]: that warmer temperature are going to exist
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: While in a mesophilic, we're going to
leave a larger profile of biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in my compost teas, I like to use
earthworm castings specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it reduces the potential for pathogens
if whoever made it didn't turn it
[SPEAKER_02]: properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making compost is an art, and if you mess
it up, you can introduce pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen people introduce septoria and,
you know, fusarium, different pathogens
[SPEAKER_02]: through thermophilic compost very
regularly, especially with mushroom
[SPEAKER_02]: compost that people use.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to use earthworm castings as my
biological inoculant and my, like,
[SPEAKER_02]: compost source.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll take earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw them in a vat of water,
your brewing vessel.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will like to add bubble snakes,
which is just like a tube that wraps
[SPEAKER_02]: around the bottom that has holes in the
bottom, and they blow bubbles down,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it agitates the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have a brew bag, and you put all
your inputs in it, and it kind of agitates
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, like, scrubs the biology off of
your inputs, and it soaks into the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then while it's in the water,
it has your food source, which people
[SPEAKER_02]: usually like to use molasses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to play around and add some
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to add oat flour, which is
something that Dr. Lane Ingham talks
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has more lipids in it, and there's
more, like, you know, fats in there for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the biology, it has a lot of
starch and stuff, and it has, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: polysaccharides that are good,
different complex carbohydrates that will
[SPEAKER_02]: feed more diversity of biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I like to use beet juice,
which you can see, which I've talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about, which is inulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a very strong prebiotic.
[SPEAKER_02]: These polysaccharides, they're prebiotics,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I make my teas with,
oat flour and beet juice with earthworm
[SPEAKER_02]: casting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then before the, like, long
fermentation process, which is usually
[SPEAKER_02]: about 24 to 36 hours, I like to add things
that are going to promote cellular
[SPEAKER_02]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things are going to promote microbial
multiplication.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said before, all proteins require
amino acids to be built.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to add amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get products that have amino acids
in them.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, like, soy-based amino acid
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's fish-based amino acid products.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use aloe vera, which I also like
to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I prefer to use it at the end,
and I'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I add an amino acid source,
but then I'll also add a calcium source.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a Korean natural farming input
called water-soluble calcium, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially exactly what it says it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's calcium carbonate that has had
apple cider vinegar added to it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it breaks it down, and it makes it an
available calcium form.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes calcium acetate, because apple
cider vinegar has acetic acid in it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and it creates a chemical reaction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Calcium acetate is one of the most
available forms of calcium that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: find in nature, and I'll add that to my
compost tea as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm creating the foundation for
microbial multiplication and diversity of
[SPEAKER_02]: biology in my compost teas with a
biological input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Earthworm castings, which has a very wide
range of biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compost teas can be as creative or as
simple as you want them to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could literally throw earthworm
castings in a bucket with molasses and let
[SPEAKER_02]: it sit and then dilute it and water it in,
and it would work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get very creative with what you're
using.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go find different, you know,
plant inputs that have different sugar
[SPEAKER_02]: profiles that feed different profiles of
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what I like to do, which is what
I'm kind of known for, is kind of creating
[SPEAKER_02]: these more concoction, potion-based
compost teas to use in my garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there will be some inputs after
you brew that you would want to add that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to add beforehand.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, that's like your inputs that are
going to have rich profiles of organic
[SPEAKER_02]: acids or amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you don't necessarily want to be
broken down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to add my aloe vera,
which has, you know, 19 to the 20
[SPEAKER_02]: different amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a whole bunch of enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a polysaccharide called acimenin,
which has tons of soil benefits and will
[SPEAKER_02]: elicit plant responses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that compound itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has oxen in it, which is a plant
growth hormone and cause like explosive
[SPEAKER_02]: growth in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want any of those compounds to be
broken down by biology, so I'll add them
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a plant input, or just
input in general, that you want to use to
[SPEAKER_02]: stimulate specific growth processes,
add it to the end of your compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because biology changes compounds from one
thing to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're using an aerobic
fermentation, that's much more likely to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen than in like an anaerobic one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, lactobacillus, lactic acid bacteria
serum.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I talked about how voracious and
opportunistic it is, if you add it to your
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea pre-brew, it can multiply and
dominate the rest of the biology in the
[SPEAKER_02]: brew, leaving you with less diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to add that to the end also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know about the inputs added after
the brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people add inputs
after the brew, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned a brew time of 24 to 36
hours, and there's a lot of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say it should be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say it should be longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just give us high level?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the risks of brewing for too
long?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what are the downsides of brewing
for not long enough?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The time period thing is just to make it
easy for people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to depend on a lot of different
factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: How much you fed, how much inoculant you
used, what the temperatures are outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the temperature of your water is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does your water have any kind of
contaminant?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the calcium amount?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the sodium amount?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have chlorine in your water?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which always you should not have chlorine
in your water, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all going to affect how quickly
the biology is going to be multiplying in
[SPEAKER_02]: your brew.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people do a short brew,
it's because if you mess it up and it
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplies too much, you can have an
imbalance in your biological profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like protozoa will start to take
over, which can be potentially pathogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also an important part of nutrient
cycling.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like our predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that's complicated, but there's
many different species of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in soil food web sciences, we use
microscopy to identify the profile of
[SPEAKER_02]: biology existent in our compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a particular microbial density of
lower bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have our protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our amoebas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have different types of protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our ciliates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our flagellates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have our rotifers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's things that we do and that we
don't want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And given a certain amount of time,
we're going to see our protozoa show up in
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers, which will consume a lot of our
lower bacteria, which is what we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also need a certain count of
protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's one protozoa, usually a ciliate,
for 10 field views.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when people are like, how long
should I brew my tea?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, it depends on how many
protozoa have multiplied inside of your
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a simple answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The simplest, safest way would be just do
it for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for six hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it for just mix it and water it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're playing with biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're playing with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a reason why people are
cautious when playing with bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: multiplying bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because you can mess it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can make people sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make yourself sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the reasons why people
say, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the reasons why I only use
earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a buddy who was turning mushroom
compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: He got some fungal infection in his blood.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We play with plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We play with biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just had someone yesterday tell me
how he got something from turning compost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You inhale aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to make yourself sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question, there isn't a
very simple answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually do 24 to 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: 24 if you want it more bacterial
dominated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 36 if you want it more protozoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to determine which one you would want,
you would need to get a microscope and
[SPEAKER_02]: examine the profile of biology in your
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you have low microbial density,
you want to add a compost tea that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a lot of lower bacteria in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have a lot of simple
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if you see in your soil that
there aren't enough protozoa, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to want your compost tea to run a little
bit longer to introduce protozoa into your
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's only determined with a
microscope, through microscopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do 24 to 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there has been so much good
information in this episode as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for coming onto the
podcast again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have anything upcoming in the
future, now would be the time to spill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can find me on Instagram at Luna
all day, L-U-N-A-L-L-D-A-Y.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a breeder.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have stuff that I've read specifically
for large yields, you know, unique
[SPEAKER_02]: expressions, unique aromas and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Patreon.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to my Instagram, you can check
out my Patreon where I have a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of different recipes like the ones I was
talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go really into depth into the sciences
behind this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have tons of research papers and
discussions about, you know, all the
[SPEAKER_02]: different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have like 100 different channels
covering different topics like we did
[SPEAKER_02]: today and breaking them down in detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can interact with me and stuff,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do podcasts with the FCP.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took a break for a while, but I'm
getting back on it and I should have I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: be doing episodes every Friday at five o
'clock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you find that on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a worker with Skunk Magazine and I'm
published in Skunk Magazine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just had a new Skunk seed line drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our website is up skunkglobalgenetics.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link, I believe,
to your link tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I think what we used last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could probably do the same thing this
time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll get all the links to what you just
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give a shout out to all the Patreon
folks that support this podcast,
[SPEAKER_00]: patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% of what is donated there goes right
back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to put it on the screen right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that are in the producer tier,
special thanks to you, Luna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, this has been just an awesome
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to invite you back on for a
part three, but I think I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you said you had 10 years of
breeding experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go about breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to sit down with you at some
point in the future and talk breeding if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm absolutely down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thank you so much and hope you
enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
