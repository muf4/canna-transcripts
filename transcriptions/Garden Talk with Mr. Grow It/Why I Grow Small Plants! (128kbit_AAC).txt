[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this video, I want to talk about why I
tend to grow smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been on YouTube for a while now,
and most of my plants are what I consider
[SPEAKER_00]: small.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from time to time, I will get somebody
to comment on my videos and criticize,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I guess make fun of me, or try to make
fun of me, for growing smaller plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and not really realize that that's what
I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, what do I consider small plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider a medium sized plant,
a plant that takes up about 2 feet by 2
[SPEAKER_00]: feet wide of grow space, with training,
and is 2 and a half to maybe 3 and a half,
[SPEAKER_00]: 4 feet tall, is like a medium sized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anything smaller than that is what I
personally consider a small plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, some of you may comment on this video
and say, you're growing a medium sized
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, I think a smaller plant is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody kind of has their opinion on
what size is small versus medium versus
[SPEAKER_00]: large.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do like to keep my plants smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they do training on the plants,
which make them make the structure even
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than if I were to just let the
plant grow naturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also aim for a shorter veg time,
and that's going to be another thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of keeps my plants small.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do I do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, for me, I am a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow just for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't sell the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any black marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do any market stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do have a plant limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the state that I grow in,
I'm allowed to grow 12 plants max.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, 12 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And see, one of the problems that I
personally have just growing for myself,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is, I'm saying it as a problem,
but I think a lot of you are going to say
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good problem to have,
which is yielding out too much for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if I were to grow 12 plants
and grow them out so they're medium size,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say they're three foot plants,
and let's say they yield four ounces per
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 12 plants times four ounces,
that equals 48 ounces, which is three
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three pounds is going to take me a long
time to consume by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just hearing that, it might click for
some of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's why you grow small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: My strategy is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about biomass at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care about maxing out grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just looking to yield around three
ounces per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the time, I don't need to max
out my plant count at 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can really do a growth cycle with just
six plants, and then that's enough for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume for several months,
if not longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also like to grow a variety of
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm growing out these smaller
plants, typically they're all different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains, and people who have been watching
my channel for a while know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I get a lot of new subscribers,
and a lot of people don't know my growth
[SPEAKER_00]: style.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a video like this where I explain it is
overdue, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can yield around three ounces per
plant per strain, I'm going to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: variety of different strains to kind of
work through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also focus particularly on quality
instead of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, some people are just going for
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're vegging out their plants for a
long time to look into these large
[SPEAKER_00]: clusters of buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I aim specifically for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of these newer exotic
strains are lower yielders.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might not get as much
biomass, but you're getting real smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: compact buds that are just covered with
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I like strains like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are people out there who don't
want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually prefer biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different strokes for different folks
is what my friend Rob over at CLTV says.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that applies to what I'm saying
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got his shirt on here right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that pretty much explains why I
grow smaller plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd love to hear from you watching
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your overall strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you go for yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you try to maximize your space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you not worry about maxing out your
space or getting a yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kind of grow your plants for quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what your overall strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has a different approach to
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what you do down in the
comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until next time, peace.
See you next time.
