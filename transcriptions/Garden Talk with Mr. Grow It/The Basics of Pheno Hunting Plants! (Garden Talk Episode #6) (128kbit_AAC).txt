[SPEAKER_01]: I'm old school man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big pin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a blue one and a red one and if
there's no issues Everything's in blue and
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's issues, you'll see a couple
lines in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna get some unique flavors I had
another one that smelled and tasted like
[SPEAKER_01]: ballpark hot dogs like, you know Like that
steamy bun with just the hot dog and
[SPEAKER_01]: ketchup and mustard you give me seeds I'll
grow them out and I will pull that genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: code out of that seed to the best of my
ability I'm looking for the one that's
[SPEAKER_01]: struggling behind because in my experience
these Squatter plants these runts are more
[SPEAKER_01]: potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice to people phenohunting would be
just grow and have fun Don't have high
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations and really enjoy what you did
whether it's good or bad Enjoy that end
[SPEAKER_00]: result What's up everybody if you that
don't know me, my name is Chris aka mr
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it and this is garden talk episode 6
in this episode I talk with northwest Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a fellow youtuber with over 25,000
subscribers He is formerly a co-owner of
[SPEAKER_00]: prism labs, which is a genetics company
and he's been growing since the early 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: So over 25 years in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about pheno hunting We talk about
the basics of pheno hunting and what he
[SPEAKER_00]: does when he pheno hunts We also learn a
little bit about him how he got into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing and he talks a little bit about
his Amazing photography that can be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: on his Instagram click that thumbs up if
you haven't already and after the episode
[SPEAKER_00]: Be sure to leave a comment in the comment
section below letting us know what you do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you pheno hunt we go over A lot in
this episode and I hope you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just get right into it Alright,
we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome northwest Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing awesome and thank you very much
for having me on the show I'm excited to
[SPEAKER_01]: be here man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I finally get to be on this side of the
table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's awesome Yeah, so a few years back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually on Jay's podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had a podcast It was like three years
ago or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like it was a really long time ago,
but it was the first one I was ever on and
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking about him before we
started recording and how how cringey I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt I was Rambling on and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm totally glad you privated those so
nobody else can see I felt cringing
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess that's probably why they're
private But no, it was a great show and
[SPEAKER_01]: having you on there was like an honor
because you're just a huge supporter of
[SPEAKER_00]: the community Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's an honor to have you on here
since you're a huge supporter of the
[SPEAKER_00]: community You've done so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just start with For the people
that don't know you if you just tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about yourself and kind of how
you got into growing Yeah, so in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community, I'm not known as
Northwest Jay my friends call me Jay and I
[SPEAKER_01]: basically popped my first seed back in 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the year I graduated from high
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that does date me tells me I'm you know
in my mid 40s, but it was nothing serious
[SPEAKER_01]: at the time my buddies and I literally
were having like seed popping contest like
[SPEAKER_01]: who can and The way I did it is I would
get like a flat plate a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: water a very clean sponge So brand new
sponge and I would put the seeds in the
[SPEAKER_01]: holes of the sponge with a desk lamp total
college style and we would we'd make like
[SPEAKER_01]: little bets with each other, you know,
like You know a little reward but who can
[SPEAKER_01]: pop the seed the fastest and on average it
was around two or three days For us and it
[SPEAKER_01]: was cool, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd just be picking out ceilings and then
we'd go to the river and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: and Plant them nothing would happen of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd come back and nothing, you know,
so it was just just popping seeds So I
[SPEAKER_01]: started doing that in 94 and then around
98 is I started taking it a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more serious Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've got let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Instagram Do you have two
Instagram pages or just one?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a couple the other one one of them
is like on private and I get so many
[SPEAKER_01]: requests And I wish I can respond to these
requests and open it up, but I just I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't find the password to this Account.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a backup account because at one
time my account was shut down I think one
[SPEAKER_01]: it was like a day after the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was announced alpha tester with nort
genetics at one time All of a sudden my
[SPEAKER_01]: channels taken away on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did make a backup channel in
Instagram I do have a YouTube channel and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the only channel I have on YouTube
It's the very first YouTube channel I've
[SPEAKER_01]: ever had I was never even like visiting
YouTube or looking at videos until I
[SPEAKER_01]: started the Northwest J channel Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was that launched?
[SPEAKER_01]: 2016 Is when I did my very first video on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's about when I think I started
following you Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were like channel Yeah, you were like
an early supporter and it was like a
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrity status when you like when you
joined like subpoena started supporting my
[SPEAKER_01]: channel Oh, yeah, mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, yeah, it was 2016 when I when I
first started making videos for YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just checked your channel now You're
up to 25,000 subscribers man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congrats on on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's huge Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually been sitting at 25 and I
deserve it It's been sitting at 25,000 for
[SPEAKER_01]: probably a good six eight months to a year
I've been a little MIA on YouTube lately I
[SPEAKER_01]: get a lot of people messaging me all the
time with huge support Hey, Jay,
[SPEAKER_01]: come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't miss you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have the occasional Person that
comes through and you know throw some
[SPEAKER_01]: slang at you a little heated at you But
it's not a paid subscription, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly when I came on I just wanted to
do a Video library was kind of like goaded
[SPEAKER_01]: into it from my buddies that grew with me
and they were like dude You have to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: channel like well, why don't you do a
channel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, well, you're the one
that knows how to do like the editing and
[SPEAKER_01]: the camera work and stuff like that and
I'm like, alright so I kind of started
[SPEAKER_01]: just updating and I don't know about you
and the rest of the community,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was around a time when You know
organ was one of the not the first state
[SPEAKER_01]: to be decriminalized but one of the first
groups of states to be decriminalized and
[SPEAKER_01]: so we were allowed to start growing for
plants and I went down, you know bought
[SPEAKER_01]: some equipment and started growing but it
was around a time that you still were
[SPEAKER_01]: afraid to type in Marijuana into the
search engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was deathly afraid to even post my
first video and when I did You kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like throw your phone because I filmed
everything at the time on my phone You
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of want to throw your phone under the
bed shut it off throw it under the bed And
[SPEAKER_01]: hide, you know once you load your first
video because you don't know what's about
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah 2016 was the first time I started
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome and photography so you're
big into photography you like to Take pics
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plants actually for those that
don't know Northwest J is actually in my
[SPEAKER_00]: book photography So I actually had like
like 10 different photographers that I
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted and I loved your photography
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's insane Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link your Instagram below and also
YouTube channel below so people can easily
[SPEAKER_00]: get to it But check out his photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's featured in my book You want to talk
a little bit about your photography and
[SPEAKER_01]: how you got got into that or yeah,
and to talk about your book You're so pro
[SPEAKER_01]: when you hit me up about picks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, are you serious?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna sell any of my picks to mr
Grow it and that you had like a contract
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for me So man again another honor
celebrity status, you know coming from Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it I've never experienced that before
and so whenever I do talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: photography I can actually tell them like
I have a contract with someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually purchased some of my photos,
which is so rare in this community right
[SPEAKER_01]: now to have that To have that,
you know option or that experience and so
[SPEAKER_01]: again Thank you for your support,
but I got into photography by Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was around 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I posted my first Picture on
Instagram and it was for it was because I
[SPEAKER_01]: was testing for a genetics company and
they wanted me to show my work on
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram they actually requested that I
Started an Instagram page and I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know anything about photography.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really in 2000 to 2003 I did go to a
film school For three years won some
[SPEAKER_01]: awards and got to do, you know,
some some pretty cool things I actually
[SPEAKER_01]: have one of my Projects was transferred
onto 24 millimeter film and it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: policy trailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a minute long, but it plays
Before the movie starts in all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: movie theaters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a trailer like welcome to our
theater Type thing, but I got to do that
[SPEAKER_01]: project and so I did know a little bit
about camera and lighting So when I jumped
[SPEAKER_01]: onto Instagram and I started taking
photos, I was like wow Because first of
[SPEAKER_01]: all, I don't know if anyone out there has
tried To actually take still photography
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy It is really hard because
you see everything that your your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: putting out but when you take a picture of
it, it just does not Represent what you
[SPEAKER_01]: are seeing so it's really really really
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lighting involved There's hundreds
of shots that go into one photo For me and
[SPEAKER_01]: just to let people know to get them to
feel a little bit better about if they
[SPEAKER_01]: tried to do cannabis photography and this
is not working out So for me to get one
[SPEAKER_01]: photo that you see on Instagram that
people like it takes 20 30 40 to 100 shots
[SPEAKER_01]: and I literally will go through them and
find that very best photo that has that
[SPEAKER_01]: certain angle or just You know that that
certain you're picking up that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Something a little different than
the other one or you can actually see a
[SPEAKER_01]: little more tricone showing but blah blah
blah But to answer your question It was
[SPEAKER_01]: when I first started on Instagram took my
first photo and I just wanted to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: getting better and better and Better at it
and to this day I still strive to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better at it and it's really hard but it's
super fun and that's kind of my new
[SPEAKER_01]: passion right now is Cannabis photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I I definitely try to take good
pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm personally terrible at photography So
maybe I can learn a thing or two from you
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny that people think that you
know, I do videography rights and I make
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty decent videos But when I go to the
photography side of things I'm just so bad
[SPEAKER_00]: and people automatically assume that if
you're gonna Be good at one thing you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be good at the other and it's just
not the case It's just so much other
[SPEAKER_00]: things to learn When it comes to taking
pictures versus taking videos Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really yeah, and it's it's kind of like
singing and dancing like you may be a
[SPEAKER_01]: great singer a horrible dancer or vice
versa It's hard to be both But to go along
[SPEAKER_01]: with what you're saying I felt horrible at
it and every time I go to this day I go to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a picture of a certain plant Man
sometimes I'm like cussing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: background like what the hell is going on,
you know with me today Like I can't see
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like now I'm wearing glasses and
stuff like that so I could see a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit better But it's really really
difficult Sometimes I think some of us
[SPEAKER_01]: make it look easy, but you're seeing the
finished product You're not seeing what
[SPEAKER_01]: goes into getting that shot and it's
really really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely So switch it up before I want
to talk about one more thing before we get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the topic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're part of A company called prism
labs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a genetics company, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell me kind of how that was born
and what you got going on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the so I actually just recently
stepped down from co-owner Of prism labs
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's on good terms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because we've kind of like branched
off onto another product And it's candy so
[SPEAKER_01]: but to answer your question prism labs was
started from I was a alpha tester for a
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics company about two years ago and
one of the Co-owners of that company kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of branched off And they're still doing
their thing, but he wanted to just do with
[SPEAKER_01]: his own thing and you know, kind of make
it like a Like, you know his own strains
[SPEAKER_01]: his own his own work and he brought me in
he says Jay You did great for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You built our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do a lot of photography You know,
like, you know print work, you know can be
[SPEAKER_01]: your thing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like to help?
[SPEAKER_01]: Create the company and so I basically came
in and helped start up prism labs with
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic 420 ink And he is an amazing
breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: He put out five strains in our first year
and I basically just went in and I he I
[SPEAKER_01]: also had the honor of helping naming a
couple of streams that curb stomper and
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubik's I helped name those strains so
that I mean that's those are opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: that you really don't have because I'm not
a breeder and I've always made the joke
[SPEAKER_01]: that chronic is the fashion designer and
I'm the runway model I am NOT a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how to grow the shit out of
Cannabis, but I'm not a breeder and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not even gonna pretend to be so now that I
feel that my job is done at prism I helped
[SPEAKER_01]: build the the actual team We have testers
from all over the world male testers
[SPEAKER_01]: female testers So it's like a really good
even group of just You know all sorts of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers and I still represent the team.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still will be growing their their
genetics all the way through at least 2021
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm moving on to edibles and It was
kind of branched off of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like the sister ship from prism
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have the entire line growing
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got Was it five different ones?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've got growing them fingers
crossed that they're females.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I actually said To them offer DNA
sex testing and I'm waiting to hear back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh nice to see if they're male or female
but totally pumped because the the
[SPEAKER_00]: pictures I seen you on Instagram that just
all looks fire every single one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: strains looks absolutely fire and you know
credit to chronic 420 for coming up with
[SPEAKER_00]: that he's Incredibly talented breeder for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He really is man in the lineup that he
created this time around is unique and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna use the word unique and then you can
judge for yourself once you start to get
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers, but Well, I know we're gonna get
into this topic a little bit later,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I my last run I had I started off with
about 24 plants and ended up with 14
[SPEAKER_01]: females and I had 14 different phenos and
I had some crazy ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you remember Sharpening
your pencil in school and it got full and
[SPEAKER_01]: you had to empty out the little Sharpener
container and it's you can smell the lead
[SPEAKER_01]: the wood pencil shavings.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a strain Here or a female here
recently that Smelled and tasted like
[SPEAKER_01]: pencil shavings, you know mean so like
this is almost like the Jelly Belly Lineup
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're gonna get some unique flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another one that tasted like this
smelled and tasted like ballpark hot dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know like that steamy bun with
just the hot dog and ketchup and mustard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and and that's the sour diesel one that
you got there I had another one that
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted like bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a blueberry We've just had dank
gassy flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good transition into our
topic today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know hunting Yeah, so some of the
questions for the viewers some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions I asked him I know the answers
to such as talk about what's phenotype
[SPEAKER_00]: what's genotype?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm still gonna ask him and kind of
get his answer on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I may have to ask you what a genome So
Fino Fino hunting Fino stands for
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype and when we talk about phenotype
I feel like we should Also mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is a genotype?
[SPEAKER_01]: So genotype for me the best way to explain
it is when you have a seed and that seed
[SPEAKER_01]: has a genetic code and that code is
Basically the blueprint to how your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow once you have a structured plant
now you're into phenotype and a phenotype
[SPEAKER_01]: can be Like the physical traits like smell
Color and that's what I like to bring out
[SPEAKER_01]: in mind is you know, the beautiful colors
a tricone production it could be Tall
[SPEAKER_01]: Spears, you know what comes with the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be chunky, you know, those are
your phenotypes and your genotype is
[SPEAKER_01]: created from the genetic code of its
parents and those parents genetic code is
[SPEAKER_01]: created from their parents and so on and
so on phenotype is created from Gena or
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and environment and that's how
you get your phenotypes and depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: climate and where you're at in the world
You might get different traits come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that genetic code You know depending on
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a good way to explain it
genetic code genotype defines the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities that the plant could have
once grown right and then phenotype is the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual traits that the plants have,
you know those possibilities that come
[SPEAKER_00]: already Reality, you know phenotypes is
what makes this particular taste smell
[SPEAKER_00]: shape color potency out of hundreds of
difference of Possibilities in the in the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I think that was a good
explanation of it So what is pheno hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: then if you don't mind me just saying
something real quick about the genome
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotype I do want to add back when it
was like, you know, my parents for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sativa and indica So there was
several Different traits on the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: that were possibilities that can come out
of that into a physical plant Nowadays we
[SPEAKER_01]: have thanks to indoor growing we have
hybrids Now the the the possibilities are
[SPEAKER_01]: endless When you put an indica and a
sativa together and now we have all of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different creations coming down the
pipeline It's really endless and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can get into pheno hunting and I
think that's what you're asking about
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now and that's what makes pheno
hunting so fun And right now that's what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really into is pheno hunting for a few
reasons I'm not really like the guy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be popping two three hundred hundred
seeds to pheno hunt I have a five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: ten.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have limited space So for any grower
indoors you have goals and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: limited space and you have to work with
that work with what you got and That's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no different than indica Anyone else
that's inside of a bedroom or um an off
[SPEAKER_01]: Room, you know next to a laundry room or
something like that or a garage or a
[SPEAKER_01]: basement i'm no different than anyone else
I only have a certain amount of space And
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you can only work with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't pop 300 seeds 500 seeds In a
five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might start off with trying to pop on
average at least 30 seeds And I may take a
[SPEAKER_01]: pack of something and just it's a it's a
it's like a guess it's like Buying
[SPEAKER_01]: baseball cards or football cards,
you know You might spend five dollars on
[SPEAKER_01]: that one special pack to get that hundred
dollar card back when we were younger You
[SPEAKER_01]: know looking for those special cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of like what uh, pheno hunting
is it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you you get a pack um And you open it
up and out of like this orange cello pack
[SPEAKER_01]: right here I will pop like five of these
half the pack hoping for at least one
[SPEAKER_01]: female.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I care about And so if I pop 30
seeds and I get one female out of 30 And
[SPEAKER_01]: trust me it's happened i've had some very
bad rounds where i've gotten a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: males and just like two or three females
You make the best of it and that means
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of growing in 31 gallon pots if
you had 30 females i'm going to grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: seven gallon pots I finally have three
plants and i'm going to fill up that room
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so veg time might be a little bit
longer to get that plant really big,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Like you guys have seen in the
past on my uh, one plant Uh one grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: that scrog and I think it was iso 8 That I
did that scrub that veg and people people
[SPEAKER_01]: freak out Sometimes when I tell them like
that veg took about four months to fill up
[SPEAKER_01]: that scrub It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why i'm not a huge scrog fan and
plus, you know You can't get over the top
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you have to work underneath it But
that was a created strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that was pheno hunted out of like 500
seeds um, but me personally I just I just
[SPEAKER_01]: I Will pop five seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, once it comes up then I start Looking
at is it easy to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of my first things I look at
when i'm pheno hunting How easy is this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, is it just you show up you feed it and
it just produces from seed to harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's one good trait that I want
to see I don't have it's not fighting me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not giving me issues Um, I want that
plant to grow and me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: tell my buddy like man this thing it grew
itself So that's a nice trait to have
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is definitely the smells and
the looks and the colors that it puts on
[SPEAKER_01]: Another trait that I look for is it
photogenic?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's something i'm looking for
when i'm feeding pheno hunting now And i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: here recently now that i'm working with
the edibles and um, the the candy lineup
[SPEAKER_01]: with nomad nomad nomadic concepts Now
we're looking for specific traits and and
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's um smell and taste and and the
effects We're looking for a high effects
[SPEAKER_01]: and um You know really good numbers and
we're looking for anything that will go
[SPEAKER_01]: good with candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for instance, we have mango,
um habanero So i'm actually going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing uh from another grower that gifted
me a pack of seeds and i've grown them out
[SPEAKER_01]: once But i'm going to be growing out a
lemon mango haze And i'm looking for a
[SPEAKER_01]: specific um flavor that goes with mango
habanero So anything that has like that
[SPEAKER_01]: mango taste or that fruity taste or citrus
taste that's going to go into that that
[SPEAKER_00]: specific piece of candy gotcha so as far
as like the Number of seeds, you know some
[SPEAKER_00]: people who are phenotyping uh,
pheno hunting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planting 100 seeds There's some
people that are planting 30 seeds some
[SPEAKER_00]: people planting 10 seeds five seeds You're
saying there's really is there like a
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum amount or and a maximum amount
that people should do for pheno hunting Or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it really subjective or what for me in
my opinion?
[SPEAKER_01]: I i'll never tell someone the right way or
the wrong way of doing it my if someone
[SPEAKER_01]: asks me like hey jay, how many seeds
should I Plant if i'm going to do a pheno
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt and i'd ask Them what what are your
goals?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like first of all, how much space do you
have and they're like I have a two by two
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can't put 500 seeds in a two by
two Unless you're out in the garage and
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to do that But what are you going
to do with all those seedlings once they
[SPEAKER_01]: start popping?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what are you going to do like?
[SPEAKER_01]: You only have a two by two space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You physically cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just have to start checking the
boxes and my Basic answer to pheno is have
[SPEAKER_01]: fun with it If you're creating a strain
you might have to pop that many seeds to
[SPEAKER_01]: find certain things because you're looking
for males And females i'm only looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not looking for males at all So my
answer would be is just have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I do with it I
just have fun with it And like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like opening up that pack of
baseball cards when you were younger You
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what's inside there and you
open it up and all of a sudden you see
[SPEAKER_01]: that foil Shiny card and it's worth 100
bucks or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wow, that's a keeper You
know, I can do something with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you didn't know that was coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't I don't have expectations
I I kind of like I like that that element
[SPEAKER_01]: of Surprise and that's the fun part of
growing for me is i'm not looking I think
[SPEAKER_01]: if you start looking into it like Oh,
I have to have this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to have that and this and that and
it takes you uh Four or five months to get
[SPEAKER_01]: to that point and you don't get there
You're gonna start hating life in the when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes to growing Me, I love it
completely because i'm not expecting
[SPEAKER_01]: anything and everything I produce I'm
happy with there's i'm not saying
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, uh, you know 100 that I
produce Um, you know, i'm i'm happy with
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's sometimes i've grown
beautiful plants that don't smoke right
[SPEAKER_01]: and then i've grown some ugly plants that
I cannot uh film or for uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh shoot photography with But it's been
some of the most amazing Um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh smoke i've ever had So I just say have
fun with it If you're just a home grower
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're not looking to create a
business or create a strain out of it Take
[SPEAKER_01]: a step back and just have fun with it like
have fun with it and lower your
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations because when you do get that
keeper You know, you're gonna be excited
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what that's what makes it fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly what I do I'm not
looking for anything in particular other
[SPEAKER_01]: than like here recently i'd say in the
past year I've been looking for like
[SPEAKER_01]: anything fruity candy like a dessert.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for the desserts right now So
that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know as a fino hunter Um,
you know, there are certain
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics that you know the grower
it's up to the grower to determine what
[SPEAKER_00]: those characteristics are Right,
and some people are going to be kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: more strict than others I feel like right
when it comes to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said you as far as the
characteristics I mean, there's several
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that people can look at
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so some of the things you had already
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a list here, uh growth structure
You know the plant's height weight build
[SPEAKER_00]: density and root strength hardiness the
plant's reaction to temperature Dependence
[SPEAKER_00]: on water resistance to mold and pests
overall strength terpene profile the aroma
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming from each flower appearance the
buds color and structure trichomes I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you look that deep into trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they lanky with small heads or short
stocked with fat heads?
[SPEAKER_00]: Peak maturity some people look at how
early is the plant ready for harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of those things do you kind of look
at any of those things that I mentioned or
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely um and but they're You know,
those are groups within within groups that
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm looking for but yeah Like I said as
soon as like for example example if I uh
[SPEAKER_01]: pop a seed Or let's say I pop 30 seeds and
all of them pop up day one Okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a good sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are some pretty strong Genetics
there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some nice little seedlings So we put
them into dirt and all of a sudden they're
[SPEAKER_01]: popping out of dirt within a day or two
now in my Experience and i've popped a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna say thousands i'm gonna say
i've popped A few hundred um, and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: there's growers out there that have popped
thousands and thousands and thousands Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean chronic the creator of uh prism
labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know he has popped thousands of seeds
Um, and there's no wrong or right answer
[SPEAKER_01]: to any of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just depending on what your goals Are
you know, that's what you should be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you should be judging your fino
hunting and stuff So when you put the
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds in the dirt and they pop out in a
couple days for me in particular i'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for like the fastest Uh,
you know seedling that sprouts and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: a sudden it's two inches out of the dirt
and all of a sudden It's got its first set
[SPEAKER_01]: of leaves i'm looking for the one that's
struggling behind because in my experience
[SPEAKER_01]: these uh squatter plants these runts are
more potent and um And i'm not saying all
[SPEAKER_01]: of them i'm just saying in my experience
and usually those are more Go along the
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of the blueprint of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your females um in my experience
when i'm growing plants and they're Boom,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man, you know when they're in that
they're developing their second or third
[SPEAKER_01]: node Uh of full leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, wow, what a beauty and then
you go to flower it and you and you love
[SPEAKER_01]: all the The stem rubs and you love the
structure of this thing and the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: look great and it looks beastie It's a boy
Nine times out of ten for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a boy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So i'm always looking for when I fino
hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um i'm patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never get rid of a plant until I can
decide if it's male or female And I need
[SPEAKER_01]: to see uh exact evidence I'm not guessing
because sometimes i've seen uh calyx
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch and they look like they're going
to be male But then there's that they keep
[SPEAKER_01]: stretching and stretching and stretching
and all of a sudden boom a pistol comes
[SPEAKER_01]: out I've been fooled before so I am a very
patient man when it comes to uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh waiting for the male and the females to
identify themselves but i've in my
[SPEAKER_01]: experience I most likely When you have
smaller plants, uh smaller growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're gonna lean towards the female end
of it So that's something i'm definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for and then once we get into like
a fuller plant i'm looking at stem rub And
[SPEAKER_01]: I only do stem rubs in the same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go all over my plant I kind of
just do it early on on the stem and I
[SPEAKER_01]: smell it and if I smell like skunky like
Or an or an uh, a distinct odor come off
[SPEAKER_01]: of it That's another good sign because
i've had others where I don't smell
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing So then we look for Like how you
were talking about how easy is this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow is it accepting water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, uh on a schedule is it is
this thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um a pain when it comes to like you,
you know, it's it's on because i've had
[SPEAKER_01]: growers ask me like hey jay What's wrong
with this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the same feeding schedule as
everything else It's got the same light
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's in the same environment What is wrong
with this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only one that's giving me
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those are some of the traits coming
out of that uh genetic code saying There's
[SPEAKER_01]: an issue with this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bitch to grow So that's something I
don't look forward to but I do continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: ride that that bull like you would in the
rodeo I never get off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna grow it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how bad Um, the growing
experience was because the end results for
[SPEAKER_01]: me is definitely the smoke And I think a
lot of us lose sight of that sometimes we
[SPEAKER_01]: get so into filming our plants and showing
the plants and the plants the plants But
[SPEAKER_01]: my end results are what is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Effect how is that medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um reacting to me and the people I give it
out to I give out a lot um a flower on a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of my grows because I want to know
where i'm at and um I haven't heard
[SPEAKER_01]: anything bad yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think the same compliments I get on
everything is number one how clean it is
[SPEAKER_01]: um, how smooth and then um, uh,
the rest of the comments are like You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, it was two hitter quitter,
um, you know lights out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really do look In when i'm fino
hunting and if i'm gonna make a clone to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow something again i'm really looking um
for like Basically, how easy is it to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: and if it's super easy to grow and it
shows off great colors And it's uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get some nice photos off of it And
the smoke is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to keep it and I want to grow with
it again So that's my type of fino hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just let the plant surprise me Um,
you know with with its results Gotcha,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you already kind of touched on my next
question here But I kind of want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back to it is is when do you start killing
off plants now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know some fino hunters what they'll do
is they'll plant a bunch of seeds and then
[SPEAKER_00]: once it pops in the medium They'll monitor
that growth for the first, you know 20 30
[SPEAKER_00]: days or whatever and they'll start killing
off plants pretty early Like I know some
[SPEAKER_00]: fino hunters they kill off seedlings um
now you had mentioned that you wait all
[SPEAKER_00]: the way until the plant shows Signs of sex
so whether that be like lay veg or early
[SPEAKER_00]: flower once you you flip to 12 12 Um,
now you had mentioned earlier that you
[SPEAKER_00]: only fino hunt females.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't fino hunt males So i'm assuming
that you're killing off once you see a a
[SPEAKER_00]: male you're immediately killing that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and um, I have never killed a plant
unless it was male and i'm i'm just not
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a breeder Um, like I said,
i'm the i'm the runway model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you give me seeds i'll grow them out
And I will pull uh that genetic code out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that seed Uh to the best of my ability
because one of the things that I think I
[SPEAKER_01]: pride myself on is environment I haven't
had a single grow in about i'd say three
[SPEAKER_01]: years that has had a drop of tap water in
it I'll take my wife's water bottles if
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm out of like water because I don't have
an ro system I have water brought in in
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon jugs And if i'm out of water
and it's feeding day, um, we always have
[SPEAKER_01]: like a flat of like the alhambra Um or the
um aquafina bottles i'll start grabbing
[SPEAKER_01]: those And uh dumping them in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but my plants have never had a drop of
top tap water in it in over three years
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always hitting perfect temperatures 78
degrees When my lights go off i'm at that
[SPEAKER_01]: minus 10 Nighttime temperatures so like
you know my if i'm at 78 my lights or my
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures don't drop below 68,
uh until late flower Then that's when I
[SPEAKER_01]: start manipulating Um, you know,
but the point to what i'm saying is is my
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is how I basically,
you know control, uh, my grows clean
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kill off the males and then um,
you so you keep all the females all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way until the end, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not killing off females during the
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never killed off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope I've never killed off a plant because
i'm telling you the end result is like
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you killing?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't smoked it yet So for me,
uh, i've never killed a plant unless it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a male and I pulled it out of its out of
its uh out of the rotation Uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's every time i've never ever kept
a male in my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and but the females, um, I don't kill
them off until harvest time Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of them technically i'm not
killing them off because i'm cloning them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I clone everything Before I send it
into flower because you just never know
[SPEAKER_01]: like man I got that unicorn and I didn't
even know it Do you imagine you finally
[SPEAKER_01]: found that unicorn that you've been
looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you didn't clone it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so and i'm not really into reveging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a revege here recently, but that's
such a pain man I'd rather just clone it
[SPEAKER_01]: before flower, but i've never ever killed
off a plant For being difficult one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most difficult plants I have ever grown
out is iso8 and I i've grown that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: out, uh four times I finally killed it off
because I got permission from the breeder
[SPEAKER_01]: And we verified that he still had his cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the cut is still out there the
original Cuts out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer have it because i'm telling
you it was It was like a rodeo with this
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the most it was the heaviest feeder
i've ever had and it's never happy Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes uh in veg you feel like man,
can I just keep pumping it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it hasn't had a water break in You
know almost three weeks So and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: it kept the more you feed it the more it
wanted it and the more it wanted I hated
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hated I hated growing that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I never killed it off until I found out
Um, it was um in someone else's vault and
[SPEAKER_01]: they had control over it But unless it's
harvest time and i'm harvesting a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um No, I never ever in my life have killed
off a plant i've even dropped equipment on
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and split them down the middle And
duct taped them back and finish the grows
[SPEAKER_01]: on them So it would have to be something
really really bad for me to ever kill off
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant other than a male Got it and
correct me if i'm wrong you you grow all
[SPEAKER_00]: of them in soil And then do you do
anything different with like feeding at
[SPEAKER_00]: all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know some will like kind of stress
their plants a little bit whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: like making deficiencies or You know,
maybe heavy feed or anything Do you do
[SPEAKER_00]: anything at all different or just kind of
the same like you normally grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to stress my plants out a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the only type of stress that i'll do
To a plant is defoliating a little bit on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigger plants like so like a Scrog or
like the you know, the big seven gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: pots and stuff like that or even like a
three gallon plot pot That you know gets
[SPEAKER_01]: the big fat leaves and is blocking uh
lower nodes I will defoliate but I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do a leaf strip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do what I call selective de-leafing And
um, that's basically if you have your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and there's a leaf set.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't take both leaves I'll take just
one leaf From that set so you're still
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding that node with at least one leaf
Um, I don't strip everything down i'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: saying uh, it's right or wrong or this or
that But i'm more of a grower to answer
[SPEAKER_01]: your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give my plants love I don't like to
stress them out and when I do de-leaf I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't touch them other than feed them for
at least seven to ten days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let them fully recover And then i'll try
to manipulate them a little bit but um in
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of my videos that i've done i've
actually shown the opposite of of um
[SPEAKER_01]: stress training I do low stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you know you see Me use pipe
cleaners if you have I like the t5 grow I
[SPEAKER_01]: did um, I did like, you know Manipulated
the plant a little bit with pipe cleaners
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of open it up to get more light uh
into that area but um I don't like to
[SPEAKER_01]: stress my plants out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact when I have seedlings,
um, I bottle feed My sprouts, uh all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way up until they develop about their
second or third full node true leaves Then
[SPEAKER_01]: i'll take them off the bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's no joke ph um, ro water Uh spray
bottles, so I don't like to move that
[SPEAKER_01]: seedling around at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to disturb it I like it to
get well rooted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mess with it And then when it gets
into that certain, um stage then I just
[SPEAKER_01]: let it live life and I monitor I used to
monitor my pms, um, you know the runoff
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out, uh, my ppms, but I don't
anymore with this new, uh, Nutrient lineup
[SPEAKER_01]: that i'm using i'm using lotus nutrients
and I don't have to ph anymore And I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to do, um a parts per million runoff
but To back up a little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I used to be that grower every time I
fed my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's just straight water
or food Proper ph if you're growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil 6.5 is my magic spot and then um,
uh I'd read the the parts per million and
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on this the growth or your stage
of growth whether you're in early
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetation or late vegetation early flower
late flower I had a range Even seedling
[SPEAKER_01]: range, um never to exceed Um, it's it's uh
runoff the part, you know, the ppm runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So i've always been a grower this monitor
monitored and uh, no stress Gotcha,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I kind of want to go back to the
the stem rub that you had talked about Um,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's uh, something that i've practiced
in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a small phenol hunt before um,
I did it for a strain that a hybrid that I
[SPEAKER_00]: created which was a brisker og by square
one genetics across what pakistan valley
[SPEAKER_00]: by world Of seeds and I did a small
smaller phenol hunt, uh instead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem rub technique is something that I did
do Um, can you explain what the step?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't I talk?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the stem rub technique actually is
and like tips on how to do it because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't use the same finger, right for All
the different plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because wouldn't that throw that off a
bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't so um, and there's no right way
of doing this or wrong way of doing it But
[SPEAKER_01]: I will give you an example of what because
I know what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't Once you've used these two
fingers and you've done a stem rub on one
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and you got 12 others that you want
to do it to um, one of the things i've
[SPEAKER_01]: started to do is i'll roll up my sleeves
And I will take my arm and i'll lightly
[SPEAKER_01]: just brush a section of my wrist kind of
like if you're Trying on like if a
[SPEAKER_01]: female's trying on perfume or cologne
They'll spritz that area and they'll smell
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then i'll do a stem rub Not really
a stem rub, but the leaf, you know The
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms of the leaves the big i'll find
the biggest leaf on the plant and i'll
[SPEAKER_01]: just rub my the underarm my forearm on it
in different areas or the top of my hand
[SPEAKER_01]: or Use these two fingers so you can get
several And then you can sit there And
[SPEAKER_01]: literally smell the different Uh,
you know traits that are coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants Um, that's the way I do it
and I think that's actually pretty cool
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's kind of like a palette you
You've built yourself a palette on your
[SPEAKER_01]: arms and that's how I do it and it's
really it's generous on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just rubbing We've all reached in
the garden to grab a pot or a tag to see
[SPEAKER_01]: okay What plant is that that's giving me
issues back there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's such and such and when you reach
back and you pull out and then you're
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting on the couch watching tv and all
of a sudden you're like man It smells rich
[SPEAKER_01]: in it and you go to smell your arm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, oh it's because I rubbed up
against that plant So that's how I do my
[SPEAKER_01]: stem rub.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really do it like on the stem stem
except for like an early vegetation when
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants are like small but once they're
The plants start getting bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just I just rub my um sections of my arm
Um on them and I really get those smells,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh distinct smells So if you're pheno,
uh hunting a hundred different plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you probably need more than two arms You
might want to bring yeah, you might want
[SPEAKER_01]: to bring uh, some handy wipes with yeah
But that's hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's hard to do man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's if if I was put in that position
i'd have to do that and like Like like in
[SPEAKER_01]: sections, you know, like, you know,
just maybe check these 10 this day And
[SPEAKER_01]: check these 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you're always checking your plants,
but i'm talking about stem rub Maybe i'll
[SPEAKER_01]: do these 10 today stem rub and i'll do a
report And then i'll check these 10
[SPEAKER_01]: because I do i'm i'm that grower that's
i'm so anal about everything like I write
[SPEAKER_01]: down everything I got logs of grows that
i've done from 2008 2009 That I mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: name it i'll talk about the day The height
how many nodes issues it's having the
[SPEAKER_01]: exact uh ppm of food That i've put into
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get really like crazy with it
Sometimes it's we all have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: add or ocd in us as a grower You have to
and I hear that a lot, um, including from
[SPEAKER_01]: like the people that you've interviewed on
your shows and people on my show Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do hear people talk about that all the
time and you're like, wow I have that
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely as a grower and it kind of
makes you a better grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you focus on what you want to
accomplish Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've done your pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you grow and you you killed out the
mouse You've got you're growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: females all the way until the end at what
point do you select the keeper pheno?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you only have one keeper?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have multiple keepers?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me again, um, like I was talking
about I don't ever kill off a plant until
[SPEAKER_01]: i've smoked it Um, I don't know what
keeper I have until i've smoked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I have to you know Harvest and
then when you're harvesting it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you you see things with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, okay, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh look at underneath These leaves and
look at all the trichomes this thing's
[SPEAKER_01]: pulling off and blah blah blah um,
but then I will um after I harvest the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant i've trimmed it now we're into the
curing And um, I have a certain technique
[SPEAKER_01]: of curing that works for me Because of
where I live here in oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, it's it's a little more um
colder damper Uh, it's not as hot like how
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, some of these people like,
you know live out in arizona and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that your curing methods might be a
little bit Different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um drying methods might be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know when you're when you're drying
your plants but um after i've Cured and
[SPEAKER_01]: i've done my burping and stuff like that
and it's been about a month of curing Then
[SPEAKER_01]: I start judging My clones that are in my
room Then I can sit there and I and I
[SPEAKER_01]: judge it in every different way possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try it out of rolling papers i'll roll
them up into um blunt Um, i'll put them
[SPEAKER_01]: into glass pipes, uh plastic bongs i'll do
it in every style of smoking I can just
[SPEAKER_01]: you know to enjoy my smoke my flower that
I created And then I really start picking
[SPEAKER_01]: it apart And um, if it's good smoke,
then I start asking myself, okay What fino
[SPEAKER_01]: was this and i'll go in the closet and
i'll start looking at it and as a clone It
[SPEAKER_01]: still looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not giving me issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: It it looks like I can plant this thing um
And then I started asking myself like was
[SPEAKER_01]: this one an easy grow and i'll start
looking at my notes Um, most of the time
[SPEAKER_01]: though is as much time as you're with your
plants like myself like the notes are so
[SPEAKER_01]: useless because you know what plant Was
the easy one to grow like because the
[SPEAKER_01]: entire time you you open up your room
You're like you're a proud parent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like there's my all-star You know,
and if that's the one that was really easy
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow and you're enjoying the smoke out
of all of them I'll keep it and I always
[SPEAKER_01]: have at least one keeper on me at all
times um, so right now currently I only
[SPEAKER_01]: have two keepers in my entire collection
and i'm growing those right now and uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them there's it There's not like a
lot of like distinct smells or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, but the smoke is fantastic I do
have an orange cello keeper that is just
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing Um, and then I have a rubix keeper
and rubix is like a very big yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the buds are massive um, um But that
one smells and tastes exactly like
[SPEAKER_01]: hawaiian punch and i'm not saying tropical
punts i'm saying hawaiian punch like the
[SPEAKER_01]: drink Um, you know the red drink it smells
and tastes exactly like that and that uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: these two keepers, um that I have
currently right now and right now they're
[SPEAKER_01]: in um, uh, each of them are in 10 gallon
pots, so they're Currently being grown
[SPEAKER_01]: into huge plants Those are all for the
candy lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the the blue diamonds,
which is The hawaiian punch and then we
[SPEAKER_01]: have um, the orange cello that has been
made into like all different types of
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors like the mango habanero and
Blackberry lemonade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my two keepers right now And
then right and then when I have my current
[SPEAKER_01]: grow up and running for youtube in this
new series I'm definitely looking for You
[SPEAKER_01]: know like more citrusy like lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for a lemon.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, uh this run, uh for sure And
then you kind of touched on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I want to dig a little bit deeper How
do you keep track of all this stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you've got 30 plus plants or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you said you have notes that you
keep do you keep notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh like online through like an excel
spreadsheet You just have a notebook and
[SPEAKER_00]: then what are some of the things that you
kind of put in the notes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe like key things that you kind of
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so yeah So, um, I I think I mentioned
a little bit earlier, but I basically i'm
[SPEAKER_01]: old school, man It's a a big pin And I got
a blue one and a red one and if there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, uh, everything's in blue and if
there's issues you'll see a couple lines
[SPEAKER_01]: in red and The red might be um,
I fed it a certain amount of nutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: the uh parts per million Just was through
the roof on the runoff and i'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow i'm way out of range That's gonna go
in red.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what did I do to get this plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of range, but I don't panic A lot
of people like oh, I gotta flush my plant
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta pull it out of the dirt and flush
it in the toilet and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever I gotta I gotta I gotta fix this
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you don't Uh when you're reading those
ranges and they're out it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna kill off your Plant it just
means that you have to water next and so
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I'll have to just do two or three
straight phed clean waters And it's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a huge runoff Um, you know,
it's like a it's like a 20 runoff It's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like if you're using like back in
the days I used to use advanced nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be like a saltier Synthetic
type food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I would do like uh in with the um
in with the new and out with the old I
[SPEAKER_01]: would I do you know do a little bit of the
Like 20% leaching I guess you would call
[SPEAKER_01]: it and read the runoffs But um in my
notes, uh, I basically just you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do like a red pen on like okay You
need the water two times in a row on this
[SPEAKER_01]: particular plant and all my plants are
named So if i'm growing orange cello and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have six of them They all read on like so
one bucket on, you know duct tape with a
[SPEAKER_01]: sharpie pen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say o c1 o c2 o c3 all of it is six
and then if I have uh, you know if o c3
[SPEAKER_01]: and o c6 are female and the rest are male
in my notes, even though it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_01]: anything in the future I'll put o c1 was a
male and i'm keeping these other two
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're female and then you know I
got my female select selected for the o c
[SPEAKER_01]: line, you know, the orange cellos My notes
are just basically for me personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't load them on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had people request them Hey jay,
i'm growing white widow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I have your white widow notes?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, those are my notes Um, that's my
personal diary and it's not to be me But
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like if you I gave them my
recipe in my environment in my climate
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not gonna have the same results
and next thing you know, they're hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: me up like jay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave this thing um, You know a quarter
tablespoon of this and you know a teaspoon
[SPEAKER_01]: of this and my plants all fucked up like
you're lying No, i'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just I had a different environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a different You know experience with
it and then I started asking people
[SPEAKER_01]: questions all the time too Like,
you know your your your water like what is
[SPEAKER_01]: your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I live in Oceanside, California and
my uh, my my tap water is coming out at
[SPEAKER_01]: 750 parts per million Well right there
you're at a range If you're in week one a
[SPEAKER_01]: veg and you feed your plants tap water
You're out of range like the range you're
[SPEAKER_01]: giving your your plants, you know with
that type of tap water You should be in
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know mid to late veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lots of good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what advice do you have for someone
who's maybe new to phenol hunting?
[SPEAKER_01]: My advice would be just have fun and grow
grow Grow that's what I say at the end of
[SPEAKER_01]: all my videos and it's not to be You know
cheesy or cliche or anything like that I
[SPEAKER_01]: say that because when I first started
growing I was the absolute Worst grower on
[SPEAKER_01]: the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first run ever was in a closet with an
actual 1000 watt lamp old school butterfly
[SPEAKER_01]: hood The magnetic ballast things buzzing
buzzing all night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean my girlfriend would be with me in
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like what the Hell is that sound in
that closet?
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a bomb about to go off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um It was the absolute worst man And then
uh, my seedlings would pop out of the dirt
[SPEAKER_01]: and i'd get like two or three nodes and
I'd flip it into flour and try to do like
[SPEAKER_01]: the sea of green And by the time you're
done, I was getting like less than an
[SPEAKER_01]: eighth off of each pot So and I you know,
you don't know any better man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was giving it like miracle grow sticks
You know, you put the miracle grow sticks
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the dirt to feed it and just water
it and stuff and it was a mess So I did
[SPEAKER_01]: get a hold of some dudes from humble
county hung out with them I learned a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of outdoor growing which I don't do but
there was one dude that was like dude I do
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor growing uh, blah blah blah and i'm
like tell me what you got and um,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's basically um You know how I got
into got into growing, uh on the level
[SPEAKER_01]: that i'm at now Is just by making mistakes
and grow grow grow you continue to grow so
[SPEAKER_01]: my advice to people feno hunting Would be
just grow and have fun don't have high
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations And really, um enjoy what you
did whether it's good or bad, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoy that end result Uh, you know roll it
up and enjoy that end result and then um
[SPEAKER_01]: grow some more So just have fun with it
would be my advice to anyone out there
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you have money involved and you
have a facility and you have uh creations
[SPEAKER_01]: and a you know, uh, you know a business
there's different goals for everyone So
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on who who you are and your
goals I I would just say have fun with it
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just like the basic grower at
home grower like myself, I think that's
[SPEAKER_00]: great advice So I definitely think we just
kind of scratched the surface here We
[SPEAKER_00]: could probably talk about feno hunting for
three or four more hours, but we'll we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fun I definitely appreciate you uh
coming on to the show today and uh
[SPEAKER_00]: spitting your knowledge about feno hunting
something that you do a lot of uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've been doing for a while now,
so How can the listeners find you and what
[SPEAKER_00]: do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyone can find me on instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just northwestj on instagram Um,
and then on youtube, I just have my one
[SPEAKER_01]: youtube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a couple other platforms like
the weed tube and cannabis I have been
[SPEAKER_01]: dipping my toes into those because You
know man as a content creator for youtube,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I actually have a pretty high like You
get those thumbs down blah blah blah and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes those can get to you they used
to for me years ago when I first started
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm like wow I did a giveaway and I got
three thumbs down like who puts a thumbs
[SPEAKER_01]: down on a giveaway like i'm giving away
i'm shipping to you for free and I got
[SPEAKER_01]: Those used to really make me upset because
you're just trying to help the community
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to give people
opportunities to to you know to have
[SPEAKER_01]: something but um, you can find me on
youtube, uh instagram cannabis and whatnot
[SPEAKER_01]: and the reason why I mentioned cannabis is
because the youtube is Just it's gotten to
[SPEAKER_01]: the point where You know when you look at
your uh, your your numbers on youtube,
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have like a 96 approval rate So
like my thumbs up versus thumb down is not
[SPEAKER_01]: that bad and I know that's going to
trigger People to go place the thumbs
[SPEAKER_01]: down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't care man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing this for any other reason
other than i'm just sharing Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a talent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I got one and i'm just putting it
out there and sharing and then it got to a
[SPEAKER_01]: point where I thought I built a library
and I just disappear but There's people
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually care about you and you
myself have developed relationships like
[SPEAKER_01]: with you Mr. Canucks All three of us have
lost and i'm not comparing myself to you
[SPEAKER_01]: or mr Canucks in any way But i'm just I am
in that category where all three of us
[SPEAKER_01]: have lost our channels at one point and
we've had to lean on each other To get
[SPEAKER_01]: that community back to find out like hey
Mr. Grote lost his channel, but you can
[SPEAKER_01]: find him here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, northwest jay lost his channel There
was a few times that canucks has lost his
[SPEAKER_01]: platform multiple times on instagram and
uh youtube and um, you know, you do a
[SPEAKER_01]: shout out video and you know It's just how
we support each other um, but uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason why i'm mentioning canna buzz
again, and i'm like Ranting about it is
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of like my safe zone right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I don't have a lot of content on
canna buzz or the weed tube But I am
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to switch towards those platforms
Um and and kind of just um that way if
[SPEAKER_01]: something does happen to my youtube
channel Or instagram, um, which at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it is what it is If it ever gets to
that, but um, I do think i'm going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: start hanging out on those platforms A
little more and also showing off my
[SPEAKER_01]: photography Like you know, I had the
opportunity with you to be in the book
[SPEAKER_01]: Leafley actually has reached out to me and
said are we allowed to use your content
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have Um, and they've you know
posted with my photos and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to go away from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did take a break from youtube And I
lost half of uh my um, uh viewers Because
[SPEAKER_01]: most of them have learned how to grow and
they they've moved on So if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: watching my channel, it's it's because you
enjoy watching me Because you support my
[SPEAKER_01]: channel like yourself like you're not
learning how to grow But my channel is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically to teach people how to grow with
the basics, you know using the basics and
[SPEAKER_01]: using what you got I'm the first guy
that'll tell you If you ask me an opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: on how to grow I will give you my advice
But i'm also going to tell you go ask 10
[SPEAKER_01]: others and get your way Learn how you're
going to grow with your environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: with the equipment you have I'm also one
of the only growers not to like brag about
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, but i'm just putting it out there
that uh, you know, even though I had a hps
[SPEAKER_01]: system metal highlight I still took bag
seeds in a t5 just to show people It's not
[SPEAKER_01]: that serious You can I can pretty much
grow with a high-powered flashlight and a
[SPEAKER_01]: bag seat at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and the reason why i'm saying that is
Because I don't think people out there
[SPEAKER_01]: should have they shouldn't have it in your
head like oh I have to have The the most
[SPEAKER_01]: fancy led light I have to have these I
have to have you know, these soils and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, these nutrient like you don't have
to have any of that Uh, give your plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a good home a clean environment
clean water And uh, you know ph ph ph if
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to But um, just give your plants
