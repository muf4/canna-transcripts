[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 153.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Alexandria,
aka Queen of the Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has been on the podcast twice before,
episodes number 30 and 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's back again this time to talk
about closed-loop gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: She talks about things such as composting,
ecological gardening, utilizing animals,
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, and many other things that relate to
creating and working in a closed-loop
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see short clips of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel where I
show the plants that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those channels will be linked down
in the YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back and I'm joined with
Alexandria, also known as Queen of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third time's a charm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say you are back for
the third time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had two other episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to look up the previous episodes
and kind of just announce like what it got
[SPEAKER_00]: for views and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first episode we did together was
episode 30, September 5th, 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time flies.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36,000 views on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we went, second meeting was episode
82, September 10th, 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a year later, 167,000 views on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can double this one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if we can get 300,000 views on
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a great talk today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're so much into permaculture,
regenerative gardening, just organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: all-natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, we're going to talk
about closed-loop farming, closed-loop
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening, closed-loop operations,
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But closed-loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that really interests
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it interests a lot of people
because it saves people money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to get into the nitty
gritty details on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, could you do an introduction
for those folks that didn't catch the
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple of episodes we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Alexandria Irons and my
business is Queen of the Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on all of the platforms
under that handle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am first and foremost, a mother,
wife, gardener, homesteader, and educator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a background in commercial medical
plant cultivation and I have since kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: grown with that career, but really focused
recently, more recently, on just like
[SPEAKER_01]: educating home growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have online classes and I do
podcasting and I write for Seedman and the
[SPEAKER_01]: Humble Seed Company and all I write for my
Patreons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably my favorite form of
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just reading, writing, and of course,
being out in the garden and actually,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just doing it, getting your
hands dirty, being in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have learned so much since we last
spoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited to talk again
because every opportunity, every garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: every day is a chance to learn more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like my life is just one long
quest to learn as much as I possibly can
[SPEAKER_01]: about honestly everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I question everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't wait to, you know, share some
more with your guests and you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like I mentioned earlier,
it's been two years since we last talked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember those conversations where
the knowledge of you just have such deep
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge on so many different things that
are beneficial for gardeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had mentioned you learned so much
since then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just can't wait to dive into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some folks that are listening in
that don't know what a closed loop system
[SPEAKER_00]: is or what closed loop farming is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that to us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you just break down the word,
what it is in itself, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Closed loop.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are closing a loop that's a circle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your farm or your garden or your home
so that you're taking something that would
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise be a waste and turning it into
an input instead of having these external
[SPEAKER_01]: sources to create like fertilizers or IPM
tools, you're able to create that loop
[SPEAKER_01]: within your garden by utilizing like
multiple species, basically, and waste
[SPEAKER_01]: products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, like I mean, first,
I have to say I was raised Mormon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were very like self-sufficient,
you know, have a year supply of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it was kind of ingrained in my like
upbringing to be resilient, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like pioneer mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've always been deeply interested
in how I can do things for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: make my own products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we see the world coming into this
kind of, you know, existential crisis or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, you want to call it inflation,
we see more people trying to save money,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to do things healthier,
because we we have no idea what's in these
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we're using, we're feeding
ourselves, we're consuming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're come to find out a lot of it is
really bad for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being able to have that power of,
hey, I created this for myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: for my plant, I grew it, I consumed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it gives you the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely more labor intensive than
just going and buying something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for those crazy enough to you want to
just do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something that I'm trying to put
into place more and more in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so last we spoke, I was in California
on a completely different farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, I have, you know,
I have a four year old son and we moved
[SPEAKER_01]: back up to north eastern Washington on the
Idaho border.
[SPEAKER_01]: My whole family is in Idaho.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Idaho is not so friendly
with the kind of plants that we like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm right here on the border and it's a
completely new garden I built in May.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have 12 acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm overlooking a little creek.
[SPEAKER_01]: That meanders through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's tons of wildlife,
all different types of species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm starting to build this homestead
where I can try to create as much of my
[SPEAKER_01]: own inputs for my garden and for my family
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means closing the loops wherever I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like, I mean, we're like 30
minutes from going into town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, a great example,
I have chickens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the chickens are helping compost their
free range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they were free ranging before the
puppy started killing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take, you know, all of your waste,
your leaves from defoliation, your weeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, from the ground, anything that
you're clearing, any biomass, any plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, you're composting it, your waste
from your kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the chickens are going through and
eating what they like, scratching out,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the, you know, maggots that are
growing in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms are crawling through and it's
breaking it down right there in your
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can turn that compost into,
you know, well, it is compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you could do a compost aerated tea or
an extract and you can apply that in your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or for instance, I have cherry trees and
pear trees and apple trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make ferments or you can eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with the excess you know, so it's just
like taking what you have and being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to turn that into something else,
not letting that it's stopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there you have that full circle,
that loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think kind of taking a step back and
trying to think about what would probably
[SPEAKER_00]: be the most difficult thing to manage when
it comes to a closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me looking in, I'm trying to figure out,
okay, how would you feed the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some ways that plants can receive
the required nutrition through a closed
[SPEAKER_00]: loop system?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you mentioned a couple things
already, but maybe kind of dive into
[SPEAKER_00]: details on some of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned ferments, which I'm not a
huge fermenter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, I did a class last year with
Chris Trump on KNF stuff and I've,
[SPEAKER_01]: God bless, you know, the KNFers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just not something that I,
that's totally an option to go for your
[SPEAKER_01]: closed loop system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a composter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the diversity of the microbial
diversity of compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you are making a ferment,
you're focusing on a set of microbial life
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's going to do its thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with compost, it's kind of a symphony,
an orchestra.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know exactly everything that
you're going to get, but it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check it out on the microscope and
you have different molecules of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: structured.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like no, it's like a snowflake,
you know, there's no two of the same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting just so much diversity
and not only in that microbial life,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the carbon molecules themselves and
what types of nutrients you can provide to
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more diversity that you put into
your compost system, the more nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity you can provide to your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can do targeted composts if you,
you know, you're interested in that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with like, there's databases online,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you can look at the NPK ratios of
every plant almost like you can go look
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I use a lot of barley in my
garden that is like super high in
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm growing barley this next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought like bulk barley from the,
you can get it at your beer, your local
[SPEAKER_01]: beer supply store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I bought the malted barley this year,
but next year my plan is to grow it myself
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's again, that's part of the
closing that loop and that cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So barley is really high in phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can either, you can compost that,
you can add it directly into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to make teas out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so not only does it contain high
amounts of phosphorus, but it also
[SPEAKER_01]: contains the enzyme phosphatases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so phosphatases is, and I think this
is important to back up that enzymes are
[SPEAKER_01]: complex chain of amino acids and they are
responsible for like catalyzing chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: reactions so that the organic nutrients
that we are all using in our gardens can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually break down and become available
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like bacteria and fungi,
they produce enzymes, but enzymes are all
[SPEAKER_01]: over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what barley is, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a seed, the barley grain itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's packed full of enzymes that
contain that specific direction to break
[SPEAKER_01]: down the phosphorus to become available to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you don't have to feed your
seedlings right away, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that first week, they don't need
nutrition because that seed is full of all
[SPEAKER_01]: of the enzymes and nutrients that make
that available to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by growing things that you,
I mean, obviously this is complex and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have like knowledge about what
you're doing to ensure that your plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting sufficient amounts of NPK because
if you're just creating a compost with all
[SPEAKER_01]: of your kitchen scraps and then hoping
that you put that on your plant and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna provide it with everything it needs,
you'll probably be sorely disappointed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So knowing what you're putting into your
compost or what it contains is really
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help you ensure that you're
feeding your plant the proper nutrition
[SPEAKER_01]: that it requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do this by simple soil testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a podcast episode with the soil
doctor and he has like a tool,
[SPEAKER_01]: Bryant, I think his name is, on his
website, thesoiledoctorconsulting.com and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can enter your soil testing results
and he will give you a customized read
[SPEAKER_01]: because not all of us are agronomists and
can read these data that's provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really having that baseline to make
adjustments and create nutrients for your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is really what's going to help you
because we don't know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is everyone eating, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what you're putting into
your compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be just like a bunch of
nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it gonna have everything that's
required?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the great thing about compost though,
and I think that this is the beginner
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we talked about this in one of our
previous episodes, like everyone should
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and that is the beginning of
closing the loop because all of us create
[SPEAKER_01]: waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should just be like a baseline of
something that we are doing that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: provide nutrition for our plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not going to be enough to
provide a well-rounded, like if you were
[SPEAKER_01]: just talking, I'm in the middle of
harvesting my croptober and I would not
[SPEAKER_01]: get the plants, the beautiful buds that I
got if I just fed them compost,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anyone has composted, they know
that a three by three foot pile turns into
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing after, you know, a few months of
turning it, it degrades and it gets so
[SPEAKER_01]: small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the amazing thing about compost is
that all of the bacteria and the enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbohydrates that are in there,
you can make, like I said, a tea where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just bubbling it with air stones
and you can extract some of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: that microbial life and the nutrition and
you can spray it across a much bigger area
[SPEAKER_01]: than if you just had that compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you're kickstarting the biology in
soil that maybe, well, probably is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: devoid of life because most people that
are listening to this are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: living in, you know, suburban sprawls
where the top soil has been scraped away,
[SPEAKER_01]: which the top six inches of soil is where
most of our microbes live.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just have that base rock,
that base parent material of soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which isn't quite soil yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by adding the carbohydrates and the
bacteria and the fungi, protozoa,
[SPEAKER_01]: nematodes, all of that microbial life from
the compost and then more food source,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can break down, we can use those
enzymes to make the minerals available to
[SPEAKER_01]: our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, I mean, it's just the way the
world works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is how soil is made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how we can feed our plants with it is
just, you know, taking a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: time to understand how the world works,
how ecology works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talked about, you know,
previously what is ecological gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this, if you don't mind,
I can just kind of segue into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ecological gardening to me is taking
that step back and remembering that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: nature, that we are all a part of this
beautiful system of life that maybe we can
[SPEAKER_01]: pretend like we know and we're
manipulating microbes to work for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in reality, 99% of our DNA is
microbial DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are more microbes than we are human.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's already happening around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being an ecological gardener is taking
that step and understanding we're working
[SPEAKER_01]: with nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are part of an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how can we make observations to see how
it works and how to, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulate but, you know, work with,
in harmony, sync with ecology?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance, you know, I've talked
about this compost tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the compost tea versus an extract,
for instance, is when, where you take
[SPEAKER_01]: compost and you would put it in like a
pink strainer and you put it in a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bucket with some air stones and you
bubble it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's bubble it for four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, bubble it for 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening each time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you know a little bit about
ecology, you would understand that every
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem has a population according to
the resources that are available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is called a carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every species has a carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you take a bunch of diversity of
microbes from that compost and you put it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a tea, that first four hour mark,
we look at it under a microscope,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to see a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically in these teas, we're giving it a
food source, which is like a molasses or a
[SPEAKER_01]: sugar or some kind of carbohydrate for
them to feed off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the further we get along, we're going
to see less diversity, but more population
[SPEAKER_01]: count.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stronger, the ones that thrive in
that particular environment are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: But only to a certain point because every
ecosystem has a carrying capacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get past a point where there's
no more resources, then that population
[SPEAKER_01]: dwindles and it dies off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so looking at your garden as a way of
how can I provide the resources to attract
[SPEAKER_01]: the species that I want that are going to
provide my plant with, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to have that's parasitic
wass, lacewings, ladybugs, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are they attracted to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I have enough of those resources to
support that ecosystem, that population in
[SPEAKER_01]: my ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or am I focusing completely on growing my
medicinal plant and wiping out all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: native species and not having this
diversity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so ecological gardening is taking a
step back and kind of looking at your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden through the lens of an ecologist
because we all are ecologists,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether we like it or not, we're having an
effect on the ecosystem that we live in
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're nature and it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's I'm super passionate about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, before getting involved in
industry, I work for the Nature
[SPEAKER_01]: Conservancy and Endangered Species
Management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is my perspective on the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's important to remember
that the most important part of every
[SPEAKER_01]: garden is you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you as the individual, you're the
one, your outlook, you're the lens that
[SPEAKER_01]: you see life through is the way that
you're going to garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I can tell you how to garden and
you can tell people how to garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the garden needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful reflection of the person
who is doing it, the gardener,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that that's saying like the best
fertilizer is a gardener's shadow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's true because being out there and
doing what you love, because maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like composting, maybe you don't
want to deal with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding things like, OK, maybe a worm
bin is more your style than, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a three foot pile of rotting, decaying
matters, turning that around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe, you know, bugs aren't your
thing or whatever it is, or maybe they are
[SPEAKER_01]: like focus in on the thing that you love
the most and have your garden reflect
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember that we are all nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all in an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so regardless of whether you think
you're ecologically gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are if you're doing it outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess indoors you could be like
not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's my long tangent rant on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super informative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, in regards to ecological gardening,
you know, one thing that comes to mind is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember a couple of months ago now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it was like six plus months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that some random fair locally here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a booth and there was a gardening
booth and they were giving out free plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, tomato plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also had information and seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually got some free seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just native species.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like wild flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I ended up getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't planted them yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved to a new house, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm trying to get my outdoor garden
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I eventually plan to plant some of
those native species because they're for
[SPEAKER_00]: this climate.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I think kind of keeping things
in mind more about what is native to your
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, learning about those species
and then adding them into your system is
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to go back to composting
real quick, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned you prefer composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several types of composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did get into composting in our last
talk, but it's been several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of composting are you doing
these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermophilic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you vermicomposting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi composting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you doing and what type of
information can you kind of give us to get
[SPEAKER_00]: going on that avenue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that this is a great
opportunity to say where the gardener is
[SPEAKER_01]: the most important part of the puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the same for the composter,
because when we talked before,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was I don't even know if I'd had my son
yet or it was like just having him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was still, you know, bright eyed and
fresh faced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after four years of parenthood,
my style of gardening and composting is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely not as strict.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was doing like a three bin method,
keeping things separate, layering it
[SPEAKER_01]: according to like height and just being
like so nitpicky and OCD about my compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm like, I got a compost corner
in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I fill it with I weed, you know,
every a few days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I fill up a five gallon bucket with
weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw that in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I throw it doesn't get measured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a pile in the corner of the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I turn it once, you know, every other
week, probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where you, the gardener,
like it's your perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what's going on for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no one right way to do
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing a worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not doing a worm bin now.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, parenthood has just changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So composting is literally just a pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sometimes it gets hot, but it's not
even getting that hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really looking into Johnson Sue
bioreactor for my lazy composting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like a combination of thermophilic
and static.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like static is basically what I'm
doing, except I'm doing a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Static is like you set it and forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what people have been doing for
tens of thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You like maybe dig a pit, throw all your
waste in there and bury it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're, you know, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Johnson Sue bioreactor is where
you put like a pallet down and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: use like hog wire or some kind of fencing
that you wrap around itself, like a hog
[SPEAKER_01]: panel so that it creates a circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put that circle of fencing on
top of the pallet and you insert,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, six plastic tubes like you would
use maybe for like a French drain and you
[SPEAKER_01]: drill holes in it and you layer it with
decaying leaves and wood chips and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have it filled to the top and you put like
a sprinkler head on top or some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: watering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it automates and you let it sit for a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thermophilic versus static.
[SPEAKER_01]: Static is where you're just letting it sit
in a pile, not touching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thermophilic, you're adding oxygen,
water and it's creating heat from the
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reaches 170 degrees for three days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Johnson Sue, you're adding air with
the pipes and you're adding water with the
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation, but you're not turning it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the air moving from the bottom
of the pallet through the sides and
[SPEAKER_01]: through the center of those pipes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you're not touching it,
it actually, it's a fungal dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: compost versus a bacterial dominant
compost where thermophilic is bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant and by not touching anything,
you're allowing the fungal spores,
[SPEAKER_01]: which using leaves and wood chips as the
primary source, which is high in lignin,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what fungus likes to feed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're allowing the fungal hyphae
to grow throughout this whole pile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're creating a compost that is
incredibly rich in mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can take that and you can
apply it all over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really another ecological
perspective, really great for your garden
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystem because most of us are in a
bacterial dominant ecology because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on that primary ecosystem,
which means that we're disturbing it all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're breaking the ground, tilling,
we're pulling new plants in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing all these things to disturb
the soil ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing that comes in in any
ecosystem after a disturbance is bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see this if you just take a
pause in nature and look at like places
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's a wildfire or a road grade
or fencing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere there's some kind of
disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see legumes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see hairy vetch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see lupins.
[SPEAKER_01]: These have associated relationship with
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, why would they do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's a disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to provide life for other plants
to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're pulling nitrogen out of the
atmosphere, putting it into the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a habitable space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the further you get along in an
ecosystem, it's called a succession.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get to that primary as the
beginning, secondary, and then an
[SPEAKER_01]: established ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to see it move towards fungal
dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more stable the ecosystem is,
the more time that it's had, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to see more trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to see more fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to just see things have
balanced out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus can spread like so far,
but it's very slow moving and it does not
[SPEAKER_01]: like disturbances.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having the understanding of how species
interact with one another and then like
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to apply that to your garden
and then like create a compost
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm really excited to get this
Johnson Sue bioreactor built.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds way more like high tech than it
is, but I mean, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to bring in that fungal
dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that's really
important to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this is, it should be important to
everyone because phosphorus is such a
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting factor because of its limited
quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Researchers today are saying that there's
60 years of phosphorus for our crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: like 60 hundred harvests left in our soils
without, with the amount of phosphorus,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we're using it, the ways that,
you know, we're applying it and it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is mobile and water when we apply it as
a salt based.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it washes down into the Gulf of Mexico,
causes eutrophication.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all of these issues with
phosphorus and it's a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we notice, how does phosphorus
become available in nature?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, mycorrhizal fungi releases
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mycorrhizal fungi creates acids and
enzymes that open up and make phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: that's otherwise insoluble or locked in
really tight in soil particles and allows
[SPEAKER_01]: it to be used by plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does barley with phosphatases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that like I am really
focusing on in my garden is how can I
[SPEAKER_01]: limit my phosphorus use, but like,
open it up what I have, maximize the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of what phosphorus is in my
garden because phosphorus is one of those,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially as an organic gardener,
like if that's important to you and not
[SPEAKER_01]: using salt based things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's a misnomer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salts are just a negative and a positive
put together, but most people just call
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to not say that a synthetic
because salts are, salts are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a negative and a positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anion and cation, but like bat guano,
seabird guano, those are, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_01]: detrimental to ecosystems, the way that we
harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're destroying islands that have been,
that are nesting grounds to get the
[SPEAKER_01]: seabird guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're destroying caves, which are such
sensitive ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a cave, how many caves are there
in the world and what kind of interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: life forms are in a cave?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are like, well, we need the
bat guano.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to just scrape it clean and
get all of these droppings out,
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying this sensitive ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then we have rock phosphate,
which is mined and that has its own set of
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically use rock phosphate or a bone
meal because that's a byproduct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's probably also CAFOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can just like go on and on of
all of the problems and you have to focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on what's important to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you can control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know that I can control accessing
the phosphorus that's naturally available
[SPEAKER_01]: in my native soil by promoting a fungal
dominance, by promoting, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the barley and the enzymes and acids that
are going to unlock the phosphorus that's
[SPEAKER_01]: already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a great way of, you know,
another closing the loop of your farm is
[SPEAKER_01]: using your native soil, but using perhaps
the Johnson's tube bioreactor or just
[SPEAKER_01]: establishing a mycorrhizal network that
promotes, you know, the availability of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the stat about phosphorus being
gone in 60 years, it's just mind blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's kind of scary to think of the
outlook and yeah, I'm glad you gave us
[SPEAKER_00]: that information and some things that we
can do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do vermicomposting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a small worm bin and then also
doing I just got a compost pile up my
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard, static composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just dumping on things on there and
then just, I'll revisit it later,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and see how things have broken
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have not done thermophilic yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a Bokashi composting, which I'm
just starting up now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm excited to do some of this
stuff and actually get my outside going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a soil test on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Bryant Mason come onto the podcast
and he did a soil testing, went over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a super low rock sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've got some work to do out there if
I want to actually plant in ground,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a long process and I'm just in
the beginning stages of all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But composting is definitely a key
component of reviving my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing a lot of that and I'm
going to continue to do a lot of that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can try to get wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a website called chipdrop.com and
you can sign up and they will bring you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to accept it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 30 yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like a giant dump truck full of wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've signed up, but I live so rural that
people in my area have said like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got mine in three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people who live in town and then the
people who live rural, like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on it for three years and
they've never brought.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm currently on the search,
but when you're, I mean, most of us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we have sand, silt or,
or clay, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As our predominant, those are the three
soil types.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you being in the desert,
I can have a lot of sand, which means it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest soil particle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the largest where clay and it's the
smallest.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a, it's so small that it has an
electrical charge and it actually attracts
[SPEAKER_01]: things to it, like water, hydrogen,
that positive molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you see like, you know,
compaction and pooling and clay because
[SPEAKER_01]: the water, it has a hard time moving
through the pore space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It attracts to the actual particle itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your sand is going to be so big
and it's just going to drain out and 1%
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like as much as you can,
I mean, composting is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to bring in a lot
more compost than just your home produced
[SPEAKER_01]: and your worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can get the wood chips,
that's an amazing way to start and just
[SPEAKER_01]: lay it down and have a huge thick,
you know, layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's also going to kill weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great, a great start to adding
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which we haven't talked about what I
mean, I briefly talked about the chickens,
[SPEAKER_01]: but animals, if you can, animals are like
an integral part of all closed loop
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can be a vegetarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was a vegetarian for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm no longer, but like animals of
whatever animal fits into your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's only worms because that's
your lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a few chickens, I mean, sounds like
you have more space than the last time I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chickens are definitely a huge,
like an introductory animal for anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so easy to take care of.
[SPEAKER_01]: They lay eggs like clockwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cute and funny and they don't need
a ton of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get like, you know, maybe a 10
foot by 10 foot and you would have,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, probably at least five
chickens in that amount of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 10 by 20 foot run and I have 13
chickens in there and they're fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're getting pest control
because they love eating insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting eggs that you can eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make water soluble calcium with
shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just collect them, bake them in the
oven, dissolve them in a vinegar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can apply that as a foliar or
you can apply it as a root drench and a
[SPEAKER_01]: tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your, one of your feeding your
plant right there with a closed loop,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're going to help you
compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw scraps to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you take their bedding and their
bedding is really high in organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have the, the carbohydrates
from either straw or I've been using hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: herd bedding for my chicken.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they take the stocks of the
hemp plants and chip it up into a fine
[SPEAKER_01]: material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was really nerding out on like,
what's the best bedding for my chickens
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's, you know, there's pine
shavings worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the hemp herd and then
there's straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like going through the pros and
cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like some produce more dust than
others and hemp herd is supposedly like
[SPEAKER_01]: the superior bedding for chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been using that and that in
itself, you could, you know, what do we
[SPEAKER_01]: use with our, our medicinal plant stocks?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could save all of those stocks and you
could chip them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can create your own bedding
and then they poop in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take that out and you compost
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you throw it right back into the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you got another loop closed right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think chickens are next on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you about incorporating
animals into your garden in order to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it closed loops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got into the chickens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, uh, had somebody on the podcast
before that had rabbits and he was
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors, but he used rabbits and he had
it, I think he had to go down into his
[SPEAKER_00]: basement and they were pooping into his
living soil beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was pretty interesting to hear
that he was using his rabbits.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to just say that's amazing to
be able to like, so they were pooping,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, did he have it set up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like automated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I guess it had access to upstairs as
well as downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think his living soil beds were
downstairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and it was just above the living soil
beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if he did like a rotation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really remember how his setup
actually was, but he was using his,
[SPEAKER_00]: his rabbits in order to, uh, get that
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to make the distinction between
rabbits and chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, um, you know, not all poop is
created equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a good rule of thumb that,
um, any pelletized poo doesn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be composted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it comes out in a little pellet,
like a rabbit or a goat or an alpaca,
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be, that's cool enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have as much nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you can use it like as a top
dressing, whereas chickens poop and pee at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really high in nitrogen, I think 5%
or something nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to compost it or it'll burn
your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just let it go straight on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are going to start incorporating
animals into your garden, whether it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, worms would be the beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Worms poo you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chickens are also a great beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, rabbits don't take up too much space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm moving on probably, I've had goats
in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm torn because I'm on 12 acres now
and I have about three acres of pasture
[SPEAKER_01]: that's like fenced in for cattle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had cows this year that grazed,
like our neighbors brought them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really was like, maybe I should get
a milk cow because milk is a great excess
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feed your plants with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can feed other animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pigs love milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chickens love milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can grow like giant pumpkins with milk
for some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if it's the calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I was like, oh, maybe that,
but maybe the goat instead, because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do a milking goat and then it has the
pelletized poo because the cow poop is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be, you know, you'd have to go
out and I've already thought this cause my
[SPEAKER_01]: field is covered in cow poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, really, am I going to go out
there and pick up all these cow patties
[SPEAKER_01]: and like push my bike?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, no, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're thinking about animals and
incorporating them, so really think it
[SPEAKER_01]: through from, because it's another life
form, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, how it's going to fit into your
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also about the poop and how you
can actually use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, alpacas are great because they poop in
the same spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you just get a giant pile and you
don't have to walk around and pick up the
[SPEAKER_01]: poop.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just go, they create a little
bathroom area and they'll just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: pooping there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, if you have the space,
I've really been thinking about alpacas
[SPEAKER_01]: just for that, but I, I can't like justify
necessarily, like just having an animal
[SPEAKER_01]: for poop, you know, like at least with the
chickens, I have eggs that I can eat and
[SPEAKER_01]: the shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I wanted to like kill them,
I guess I could eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the same with the goats for the milk,
but an alpaca is just like, I guess I
[SPEAKER_01]: could learn how to like make yarn or
something from the fur.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not really sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's like, you know, and think
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to incorporate animals for
this closed loop system is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: how are you really going to, how is it
going to fit into your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: What byproducts are they going to create?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how are you going to feed them
and how are you going to handle the poop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because not all poop is created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good advice about not all poop
being created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea that the rabbit poop was
going to be more readily usable versus
[SPEAKER_00]: chicken manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to have chickens eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some people down the
street from where I live that have
[SPEAKER_00]: chickens and, uh, I worry cause it gets so
hot here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred degrees every day,
June, July, August.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know too much about how
well they do in heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they're obviously be in a coop
and there'd be shade and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then winter time, not really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd have to do more research in order
to figure all that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, it's something that I would
definitely consider adding in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Guinea hens are also an option then for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, chickens can handle really severe
temperatures, but Guinea hens are from
[SPEAKER_01]: Africa and they're wild and they don't
even need a coop as long as you have like
[SPEAKER_01]: something for them to fly up into at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to flip it up now, move on from
that and let's get into IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think this is an area where a lot
of folks that are going the organic or all
[SPEAKER_00]: natural route, they kind of struggle
because there are so many products that
[SPEAKER_00]: you can buy on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some being safe, some really not being
safe, but there are all natural ways to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about how you go about IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I think it's really great that you
said, you know, some are safe and some are
[SPEAKER_01]: not safe, even if they're organic,
even if they say they're organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did some consulting when I was in
California as a licensed cultivator and
[SPEAKER_01]: really like your, your product is being
tested for dispensaries and they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: really stringent testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had one of my clients who was
using a product called Pyganic and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: pyrethrum based.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but pyrethrums are like made from
chrysanthemum flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's like natural, but it takes 64
days for it to leave the tissue of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's like, if you spray once in
early flower, you're, it's going to show
[SPEAKER_01]: up in your testing and then you're going
to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then think, or you may not fail for
your flower, but then you may concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it shows up in your concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is like a big problem because we
think that like just because it's organic
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's sold in the store that,
and it says it's safe that we can use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, same thing with like neem oil,
you know, there's anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: People suggest that, you know,
hyper emesis could be correlated with neem
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know definitively if that's true
or not, but it's like, why spray our
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers with anything, even if it says
it's natural, um, that could cause issues
[SPEAKER_01]: for our health.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and same thing with our food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food is medicine more than anything else
in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you eat three meals a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you put into your body is going to
determine your health.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that is the hands down, like the
biggest indicator of our health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me to approach IPM in an integrated
and holistic way, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm creating the healthiest plant that I
can because having natural immunity is
[SPEAKER_01]: right there in itself going to help
prevent pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means, um, boosting it through
things like aloe and salicylic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying that or silicon, you know,
and having the strong cell wall so that
[SPEAKER_01]: piercing biting insects can't,
you know, it's harder for them not giving
[SPEAKER_01]: too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see this all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: People posting these photos and the leaves
are really, really, really dark,
[SPEAKER_01]: dark green and kind of curling a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks slightly like if you can see
any kind of nitrogen toxicity,
[SPEAKER_01]: any kind you're over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a signal to all of the piercing
biting insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aphids love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the soft bodied insects know when
there's high nitrogen and we'll go to that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having your plants in a nice,
as healthy balance as possible is like the
[SPEAKER_01]: first thing that I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plant sweet alyssum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plant buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plant daikon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, always those three around my garden
and I do sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say, let's go back to the sweet
alyssum attracts green lacewings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green lacewings eat like everything you
want to attract beneficial insects that
[SPEAKER_01]: are like omnivores that just go crazy and
will eat the aphids and the spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll just take on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, parasitic wasps, they'll do the same
with the aphids and caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they come to the buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ladybugs come to the buckwheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and trying to stagger, like I really
love buckwheat cause it just keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the sweet alyssum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just like a one and done kind of
a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, sunflowers attract birds, which are
going to, you know, consume right now my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not right now, but earlier in the
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, my biggest issues were grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't like too horrible,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They just eat the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because I live in the Palouse,
if you're familiar with that area,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, um, what, like basically the bread
basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we produce almost most of the wheat
for the U S in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the wheat growing area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone around me is growing like
wheat and Timothy and alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like grass, hay, wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I, so we have all these
grasshoppers and they came down and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're nibbling and I didn't think
anything of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my chickens free ranging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're eating the grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got sunflowers, attracting birds to
help eat them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I saw on one plant this amazing
variegation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, uh, white, pink,
splotchy, variegated, um, coloring on the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually when I'm done, it was
flowering, it did it into the flower as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was only on this plant that this
one plant in this specific area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it started, I noticed, um,
curling the leaf tips as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I looked online, I looked on
Instagram, I looked on Google scholar as
[SPEAKER_01]: people's pictures, just to see if I could
find anything that resembled this odd
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and the closest I could come to
find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking specifically at viruses
and viruses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I found beet curly top virus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's transmitted through grasshoppers
and fricking leafhoppers, which I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: surrounded by.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then all these conventional fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay, this is my,
uh, um, you know, my hypothesis for this
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogen or what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw it start slowly moving
further around different parts of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also into localized spots on
other plants that were just around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the grasshopper feeds on one leaf
that's infected with the viroid goes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the other plant feeds on it and it
spreads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a little side tangent,
but, um, it was just, that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to observe nature,
to see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, what, what I'm already doing,
right, is trying to boost my plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: immune system naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on this product right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, it's something that I use in my
garden every, every, every week,
[SPEAKER_01]: immunity, that's what I call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's how can we boost our plant's
natural immune system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it came as a result because I had a
garden that was infected with hot latent
[SPEAKER_01]: viroid about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, what's associated with that is
dudding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can boost your plant's immune
system as much as possible, it's not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be what it would be if it was a hundred
percent healthy, but in a living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: system where you can't just get rid of all
of your soil, especially when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: planting in the ground, the virus or
viroid can live within the mycelium of
[SPEAKER_01]: your living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can live, it can just stay there so you
can keep seeing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to boost your plant's natural
immune system with things like salicylic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid, jasmonic acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: These two plant hormones are the hormones
that communicate with the plant about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on in the outside world to
the inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So jasmonic acid and salicylic acid are
either abiotic or biotic factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's living or non-living.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stress of either heat, drought,
uh, cold, whatever, you know, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of stress, uh, over-watering,
under-watering, or we have, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: biting, piercing insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's jasmonic acid where salicylic
acid is like that heat, that
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they communicate with each other
and they communicate with all of the other
[SPEAKER_01]: plant hormones inside of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so how do we take our plant and
increase the levels of jasmonic acid and
[SPEAKER_01]: salicylic acid within our plant to
stimulate, um, that communication so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a better immune system first and
foremost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like insect frass, which are
going to boost the natural jasmonic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: things, same with a mycorrhizal fungi
actually increases jasmonic acid,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, aloe and contain salicylic acid and
increases your plant's salicylic acid
[SPEAKER_01]: levels within it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I did like, this is years of me
reading white papers and going through
[SPEAKER_01]: different various instances in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's just natural things to boost
your plant's natural immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you some when I see you at,
uh, MJBizCon in December, and you'll have
[SPEAKER_01]: to let me know what you think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would be the beginning of your
plant's health and IPM is just doing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything you possibly can to boost its
natural immunity and then create an
[SPEAKER_01]: environment that has that the defenders,
the microorganisms that are thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think of your immune system,
you have the right microbes in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to have a healthy microbiome
in your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have a diversity of companion
plants to attract beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you can use specific microbes
to combat specific pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite thing, um, is just knowing
how, how amazing these little microbes are
[SPEAKER_01]: at doing specific things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, for instance, like Bavaria
bassiana is a really popular one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I really like Isaria Fumoserosia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the issue with these bio controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those two are types of fungus,
fungal spores that you can inoculate,
[SPEAKER_01]: spray on your plant, and they're going to
sporulate and infect pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the pest will die.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the issue we have with that is that
they need to be applied in a specific way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's typically at a, uh, like 80% relative
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you need to have that knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that ecological gardening to
understand how species interact with one
[SPEAKER_01]: another, what kind of environment do they
need to thrive in, and then understand the
[SPEAKER_01]: mode of action.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the Isaria Fumoserosia,
which is a strain that's in like Ancora,
[SPEAKER_01]: PFR 97, no fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it really, it's very particular of the
environment that it needs to, to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs at least two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have an aphid infestation,
which aphids are born with four to 12 live
[SPEAKER_01]: young without having sex, they're asexual
reproducers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are, that's two weeks, 14 times
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: To 12 per day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your infestation is out of control at that
point, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't wait around for a zombie's
fungus spore to kill and all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you think about like, okay,
I've got my beneficials around.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one layer of integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can use a bio control, but I really want
to knock it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you would use perhaps a
chemical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The three pillars of IPM are cultural,
biological, and chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultural being your practice as the
gardener.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, not coming into your
garden with dirty clothes from visiting
[SPEAKER_01]: your friend's garden or using dirty tools
or, um, you know, how you're, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: observing your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you de-leafing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you looking for insects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing these things?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your first layer of defense.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you raising your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it healthy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, are you overfeeding nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all that cultural.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the biological is the companion
planting, the beneficial insects,
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbes that you're inoculating with,
um, under either underground or spraying,
[SPEAKER_01]: applying it as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then chemical is like a last
resort, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but sometimes we need to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like for vegetative phase,
I go for neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem is something that has been used for
thousands of years in Ayurvedic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's safe to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Men would take it in India.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it slows your sperm down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's a natural male birth control
and it does the same thing for insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is slows down the reproduction of
insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: It slows down their molting process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It slows down everything, the life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use a neem meal in my soil as an
amendment.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a fertilizer as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I use a neem oil and the
vegetative phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I need to, if there is a infestation,
I saw one aphid and
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, you are not getting into
this garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, I luckily I'm out in the middle of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: No other growers around me, just wheat
fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sprayed with a neem and then I
sprayed with the Isaria Famosa Rosia and
[SPEAKER_01]: the neem wasn't what it does is like
you're, you're, you're stacking things to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure and doing it in the right order,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, um, the neem is going to slow
down the reproduction of the pest and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can hit it a couple of times and then you
want to bring in the biological control,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the fungal spores that are going to
have time to do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just like layering and using
things in a, like a purposeful way and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how they attack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I actually just started using a
new product, which I am not a product
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I try to, you know, we have to have
products, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't make everything homemade,
but, um, organic shield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard of it or used it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is made, it's synthetically
produced, but it's based off of a sucrose
[SPEAKER_01]: octonate, which is a, um, sugar ester that
is found in a tobacco plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they weren't able to, uh, extract
enough of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they synthesized that molecule in a lab
and it is supposedly safe for,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the guy I had, I interviewed him
and he's like, oh yeah, he uses it on his
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen to clean things and you could
drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, yeah, I don't know about that,
but, um, I use that once after,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, in flower, like in a being an a
flower, cause I'm not going to use neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, we don't know if neem is
safe, if it's combusted, there's anecdotal
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence about the hyperemesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also has a really strong smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's like Indian food.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't want to be spraying that on
your butts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the last, you know,
that chemical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did three sprays, um, four actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So neem in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fungal and then later on I
did spray once with the organic shield
[SPEAKER_01]: just to see with the, the grasshoppers
because he said supposedly that they would
[SPEAKER_01]: kill grasshoppers and I did see dead
grasshoppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, okay, you know,
I guess this works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, didn't have a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did spray once more for
caterpillars with bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's roughly September's for
caterpillars outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so I had some moths, if you see
moths and you're probably going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did spray for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and bacillus is, you know,
it's a soil dwelling bacterium that only
[SPEAKER_01]: targets the family lepidotera,
which is a caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pest specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will only kill caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for instance, if I was in flower,
other flower safe things, that I would do
[SPEAKER_01]: would be like, um, other types of
bacillus.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a whole variety of bacillus
bacteria and they can out-compete things
[SPEAKER_01]: like botrytis and powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, same thing with trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to do like a five blend,
five strains of different trichoderma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trichoderma is a fungus that's super
aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just by spraying your plant with
it, you can out-compete for other
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens in the fall, like again,
botrytis or powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it's ubiquitous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these microbes are everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be on your plant,
but maybe not in that high of
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so it's typically, it's just safe
to spray your plant lightly with the
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma bacillus blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you're not going to have to
worry about so much like the bud rot and
[SPEAKER_01]: the PM that can, that we know can have
detrimental effect if you consume moldy
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like, like that's terrible
for your health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things that I would do
for a flower safe IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every episode that we've filmed together,
it's just been jam packed with
[SPEAKER_00]: information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just so useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you definitely have this advanced
knowledge that you're able to explain in a
[SPEAKER_00]: beginner friendly manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's one reason why so many
people like you is because you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of help the folks that often are just
starting out or maybe they're in
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate stages or maybe advanced
folks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have so much good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This hour flew by.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been sitting here for an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more to say about close up
gardening, but maybe we can get you back
[SPEAKER_00]: for another episode to continue on the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they could find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So queen of the sun ground.com,
you'll find all of the things there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, the Instagram, the YouTube,
I have a Patreon, um, where I put my,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, my writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do weekly classes every Tuesday at four
20.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can come and hang out and we talk
about whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously I can nerd out for an
hour easily on different topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, you know, sign up for my
newsletter on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do publish things once a month with tips
and tricks about things in the garden and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, just check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come say hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love answering gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can literally send me a DM or join my
discord and I will try to help you to the
[SPEAKER_01]: best of my ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that everyone should grow more
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Literally we are, let's connect the flora,
fauna and fungi in our homes and our
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens and not just grow the one
medicinal plant that you're going to know
[SPEAKER_01]: is so popular to talk about, but like grow
as much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, like my goal this next year is
to grow 50% of my family's food.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I bought a cow that's in the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've got the chickens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I planned out my entire 2025 garden
with the amount of plants that to produce
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of pounds that would feed a
family of three for an entire year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can follow along on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have questions about that,
I may teach a class on it because it's so
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, food is, like I said, food is
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So connect with me in any way that you you
would like to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much exciting stuff upcoming in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely be following along this
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to
Alexandria's channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could easily get to her and give
her a follow anything regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening, all natural organic
permaculture, all that stuff, closed loop
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening, follow her for all that
information.
