[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody, if you thought don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grud,
[SPEAKER_02]: and welcome to my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got another discussion video for you
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: For this one I brought in Chris from Happy
Hydro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about environment, particularly in
dual-grow environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talk about the temperature,
humidity, CO2, and air circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You all have made it very clear that you
want to see more of these type of
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion videos.
[SPEAKER_02]: The video I did with pigeons on plant
transplants, has over 105,000 views right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: The video I did with Rob from CLTV talking
about plant nutrients, that has over
[SPEAKER_02]: 175,000 views as of right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you all have made it clear that you
want to see more of these discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: videos, and got one for you today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The audio on this video is actually
recorded onto one channel, so Chris's
[SPEAKER_02]: voice on it is slightly lower than mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the future I'll make sure to record on
two channels, so that way the audio will
[SPEAKER_02]: be better in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's still pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still listen to it, so don't click
away just yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, Chris?
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to talk about... Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ready to talk about environment or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll cover, let's cover temperature,
humidity, let's get into CO2, and then air
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically covers everything that has to
do with plants environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that Tom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're located on the west coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the east coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with different natural
outside environments, which affects,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, inside environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, correct me if I'm wrong,
there's not, people don't really have
[SPEAKER_00]: basements on the west coast, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't have a basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's just, yeah, on the east coast,
you guys, almost every house has a
[SPEAKER_02]: basement, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like every house in Buffalo pretty
much has a basement, and it's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: good spot to grow in terms of like trying
to keep things private maybe, like from
[SPEAKER_00]: family friends, visitors, you know,
it's a good way to keep things separated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's, when I say it's a good place
to grow, it's not an easy place to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of like, you know, humidity,
temperature, and controlling things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I take it you grow in basements?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown in basements in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest issues that you have is a lot
of basements aren't completely waterproof
[SPEAKER_00]: or sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you get like a basement that has
cracks in the walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can easily find yourself dealing
with mold, mildew, and just like things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, that can really screw up a
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the optimal place to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you, you know, if you have a two
bedroom house and a roommate, and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere to grow, and you got a basement,
it's like, well, obviously, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize that space as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to look out for cold concrete
floors, you know, it's, you don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just set your plants on the cold concrete
floors in a basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just in the summertime,
dealing with humidity, dealing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: extreme cold in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some of the challenges,
but it is a common area that people do
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people could get some
value out of some tips on how to grow down
[SPEAKER_00]: there, if you're on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can definitely talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start off with temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So me living on the West Coast,
I actually live in a very dry climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: very hot climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in a desert region.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a more humid climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since you're on the East Coast,
you have bodies of water around you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more humid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot more colder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think our discussion, I'm pretty
excited to have you on here in particular,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you live in such an opposite
climate that I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are different pieces of
equipment that we use in order to control
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, humidity, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of starting with temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ideal temperature that I usually
aim for when I'm growing my plants is
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere between 70 degrees and about 82
degrees Fahrenheit, roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some people may be watching this,
they may have read my book and saw it was
[SPEAKER_02]: slightly different than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in my book is kind of a general
guideline for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of narrowing that down.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be a little bit more ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leaf surface temperature of 82 is what
I've heard to be ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I kind of aim for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If that means that the canopy temperature
is a little bit higher than that,
[SPEAKER_02]: to achieve that leaf surface temperature
of 82, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as far as how low it goes,
I had mentioned 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if it goes into the 60s,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually do like to drop my temp in the
60s towards the end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: That way it tends to bring out some of the
colors and some of the phenotypes that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: So going down to the 60s is fine for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant will still grow just fine in
that range.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having a swing greater than 10,
15, once you get to upwards of a 20 degree
[SPEAKER_02]: swing between day and nighttime
temperatures, that's when you might want
[SPEAKER_02]: to cause for alarm or might be stressing
out the plants too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I would do pretty much
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing on the East Coast that we
have to look at out for is if we drop the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature down to 60 degrees in late
bloom, and we are not aware of our
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity levels, and we have high
humidity, low temperatures, it's a prime
[SPEAKER_00]: time opportunity for powdery mildew to
start growing in your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've dealt with it in the past,
having too cool of a bloom at night with
[SPEAKER_00]: too high of a humidity from growing in the
summer or growing in a basement that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: completely dry, or even growing in an
upstairs bedroom or something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't... If you don't do a good job
of keeping your humidity low, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely have issues with powdery mildew
with cool temperatures and late bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would warn people to watch out for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing I wanted to...
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what percent is high RH?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you consider high that you're at risk
for powdery mildew?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're in late bloom and you're
over 60% humidity, I think you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to creep into dangerous territories.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm sure it's debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with you on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had bud rot in late bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big, large, dense buds, higher humidity,
not enough air circulation that is
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in this as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with powdery mildew, and it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so depressing when it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like you've just spent three
months, maybe four months doing all this
[SPEAKER_00]: work and you're about to trim or you're
about to be cutting down soon and you find
[SPEAKER_00]: that powdery mildew and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, oh man, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we now we have to throw a lot of this
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to rewind a little bit, you mentioned
the plant canopy and leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I wanted to mention is that
if you're using like a grow room monitor,
[SPEAKER_00]: such as like the pulse sensor or sensor
push or any really temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be like a $12 Walmart temperature
thing with the probe or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That probe you're going to want to have in
your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The temperature at your canopy on top of
your canopy could be different than the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature in the in the side of your
room or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's important for people to
know that they want to take their
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature levels at the canopy where the
plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it can be different throughout the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people have a room
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have that canopy temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people actually put it down by
the soil so they can get kind of get an
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of what the soil level temperature
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, of course, if you have that humidity
monitor just resting on top of your soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: it could kind of be inflated as far as the
humidity number, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a wet medium, moist medium,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not going to give you a real
accurate representation of what your
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature is in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like above the soil,
but it kind of gives you a general idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: what your temperature and humidity is at
the soil level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, canopy level, great call out is
to get measurements there for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned bud rot and you're
cooling your temperatures down and late
[SPEAKER_00]: bloom and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that you can do or that growers
can do to avoid that issue, even if the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity does get high in the room,
is to have good air circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this was on your list of things
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have good air circulation,
it makes it hard for mold and mildew to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the leaves on your plants just
moving a little bit, signifying that there
[SPEAKER_00]: is good flow coming through the canopy is
going to prevent the possibility of a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of mold and mildew and bud rot and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to take a step back and talk
about temperature just a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the temperature is, one thing that I
use to regulate the temperature in my grow
[SPEAKER_02]: environment is an inline fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the AC Infinity inline fan,
which I know that you are familiar with.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use the T6 model.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my 4x4 grow tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you who don't know about the
AC Infinity fan, there is a controller on
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This fan is pretty advanced compared to
other fans.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually have set points on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a probe and set points.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually hang that probe in
canopy level and you can have the set
[SPEAKER_02]: points for certain temperature and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I have it set for is the
temperature at 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once the temperature actually goes up
and reaches 82, my AC Infinity fan will
[SPEAKER_02]: turn on and it will start to exhaust some
of that hot air.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then of course my lung room or the
room that my grow tent is in has air that
[SPEAKER_02]: is around room temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's usually around 70, 72 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that air is coming into the grow tent,
passive intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, once that hot air is being
exhausted, the fan will automatically turn
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's intermittently coming on,
controlling and controlling and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping that temperature around 80,
82 degrees when the lights are on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when the temperature is too low,
so say it goes down below my ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, like I mentioned,
70 roughly.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it goes into the 60s, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a heater in my lung room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lung room, the room that my grow tent
is in, I have a heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to stabilize the temperature at
around 70 degrees, 72 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, now on my heater,
there is a feature on there which is going
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you can set the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the temperature drops below that set
point, it's gonna kick on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my lung room is stable at all time due
to the heater.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as my grow light is on and it's
exhausting with that hot air, that stable
[SPEAKER_02]: air coming in about 70 degrees is coming
into my grow tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my fan is coming off and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how I regulate temperature in my
grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one other thing to mention was
the sensor push.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensor push, pulse, those are monitors
that you can use within your grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally use a sensor push one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually just got the pulse one thanks
to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't used it yet though.
[SPEAKER_02]: But having that canopy level as well and
getting alerts through your smartphone,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's an app that you connect and
tells you what the temperature is,
[SPEAKER_02]: what the humidity is.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just see it on your app.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't actually have to go into your
grow room.
[SPEAKER_02]: So using those pieces of automation.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean records?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it records the data over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can go back and you can look at
your graphs and be like, oh, I noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that every November this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the graph, it gets too cold in my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know I need to have a heater in
November.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can go back and analyze the data
or like I'm noticing that in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the night it gets too cold or it gets too
hot in the day or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go back and analyze.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can also do the set points as well
on sensor push where you get notifications
[SPEAKER_02]: on your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the temperature drops too low,
I'll get alert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I can go into my room, figure out,
hey, why is this heater not working?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I need to increase the temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if it gets too high, maybe something
went wrong to my lung room, the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature is too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the air coming into the grow tent is
too high so that I need to make
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustments, maybe add an air conditioner,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how does it work with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the sensor push and
how it can give you alarms to your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: This technology of like those types of
alarms, greenhouses have been using for
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my wife, her grandfather owned a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's passed away and the business was
closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in his greenhouse, they had alarms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it didn't go to your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a wire ran.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was an alarm in their bedroom,
in the house, like in front of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was too cold or too hot,
the alarm would go off at three in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning and they'd have to wake up and go
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got a $10,000 crop they got to
make sure it doesn't die.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think it's funny how the
technology is still kind of the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: but now it's like right on my phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to have an alarm in my
bedroom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when the temperature reaches too
low, I'm using a heater in my lung room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature is too high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have a central air conditioning
is what I've used.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've used those portable air conditioners
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't have good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, temperature was super stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as far as energy consumption,
it was super expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've avoided using that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just use my central AC now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just in my area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I mentioned, my climate that I live
in, I live in the desert region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm able to kind of get away with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to run a heater and do you
have to run any sort of air conditioning
[SPEAKER_02]: too?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the East Coast, if you're growing in
like your house where you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, central air or heat,
it's going to be very similar to what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be a whole lot
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, if you're growing in a space
where you don't have like, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: a friend of mine is growing in his
basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he does in the wintertime is he
runs a couple of the Growers Choice 500
[SPEAKER_00]: watt CMH lights instead of running LED
lights, because he actually uses the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: from the lights to keep the grow space
warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they shut off, he's got,
you know, a heater down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think he actually vented his like
heater for his house to like be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce heat into the basement grow room
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's something that people in
cold environments can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, LEDs are efficient and they save
on heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you need heat, use an HPS or a CMH.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's going to generate a lot more
heat and heat up your grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know growers who that's what they run in
the wintertime is HPS so they can warm up
[SPEAKER_02]: their grow space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the summertime, they go to LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, it's pretty common on the East
Coast, at least for the people I know and
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers that I've met in the local
grow shops and stuff when I worked there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shift gears over to humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humidity, you know, there's a lot to be
said about humidity, what the ideal range
[SPEAKER_02]: is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of people go again,
go for VPD, a VPD vapor pressure deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won't get into too much detail about
what that is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel free to Google if you want to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, your humidity level goes by
the temperature, leaf surface temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: to be more exact.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people just use the temperature in
the grow room to kind of chase after VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does call for higher, higher
humidity than normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you do come across risks for things
such as bud rot, pottery mildew mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What calls for higher humidity than
normal?
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're running like 80 degrees,
I mean, we can bring up the chart right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can summarize VPD for
those who might not know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, like your plant is going to
release moisture from its leaves based on
[SPEAKER_00]: how humid it is in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: It transpires, it releases humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water will transpire out of the leaves
into the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the room is very humid,
it will transpire at a lower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the room is really dry, it's going to
transpire at a faster rate, which is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to affect how often you have to water the
plant and the health of the plant and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's producing cells and growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's one thing I run into is
very low humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transpiration increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm running synthetic nutrients,
for example, bottom nutrients of feeding
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant could run into very,
very well run into a toxicity issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happened before to where you have too
much because your plants drying out the
[SPEAKER_02]: medium a lot quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's uptaking nutrients quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a plant available nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't run into toxicity issues with
low humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of bringing up that humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting back to the VPD, I'm looking
at the chart right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, if you're running a
temperature of 84 degrees, it's calling in
[SPEAKER_02]: the green area for about 70, 74 to 78%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just give you an idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, you know, some people are hearing
that and they're like, Oh wait,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, that's way higher than what I'm
running right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might hear that number and
they might be like, Oh, I hear powdery
[SPEAKER_02]: mildew, powdery mildew knocking at the
door, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it's risky.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think chasing after VPD, I think is
definitely risky.
[SPEAKER_02]: The general range that I usually aim for
is between 40 and 70.
[SPEAKER_02]: 60%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I can avoid powdery mildew,
you know, bud rot when it comes into
[SPEAKER_02]: flowering, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, um, what percent humidity do you
usually aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's, um, I'd like to just talk
about early veg for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, well seedling clone and early veg,
because I feel like that is a point in
[SPEAKER_00]: time where humidity is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, a lot of people have issues with
their plants during these periods that
[SPEAKER_00]: they think are due to PA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Age nitrogen toxicity or not enough
nutrients, um, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's hard to sometimes pinpoint if
you're not tracking your humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, uh, the, the, uh, the general
consensus really is that you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: high humidity in, uh, early veg and for
your seedlings and clones, or they just,
[SPEAKER_00]: they, they don't grow well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring up a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have said that it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference that it makes, like I've,
I've seen a girl, you know, maybe I was
[SPEAKER_00]: even involved in it that had, you know,
just fetching plants that just look like
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, why is this happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what do we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: We, you know, we go through the list and
we try to narrow it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's introduce a ton of humidity,
uh, to the room and get it up to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three days later, all of the plants are
just, I call it praying for light when the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves are just like, they just look so
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, so, I think like early veg,
it, one of the biggest problems that
[SPEAKER_00]: people have that they overlook or don't
put enough kind of like, uh, effort or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever into is, is figuring out or is
getting their humidity up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, one thing I saw, which is really
cool from seed to stone, he has these
[SPEAKER_00]: little plastic domes that he puts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so he transplants the seedlings or his
clones into the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he has these like plastic domes
that he puts over them, which acts as like
[SPEAKER_00]: a little humidity dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the humidity up, uh, as the plant
transitions into its new vegetative state
[SPEAKER_00]: and a new pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen you do it with like plastic
bags, plastic bags over the cups.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That helps with seedlings for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is cool too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the biggest changes that I
made, like as an early grower was
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing more humidity and a veg and
just, it's just, it's a, it's a big,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You bring up a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have said it earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I mentioned that the 40 to 60%,
the 40, 60, 40 to 60% that I mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier is really for, for veg and flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are safe routes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now when you're in seedlings, clones,
um, I run higher than 60%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I aim for like 65 to 85% is typically what
I aim for on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they're in veg, um,
you know, mid veg is when, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I get below 60% and that goes
against VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some people are going to say
that this isn't ideal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just kind of talking general
range that the plant will grow in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I think that's the kind of a
general range.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I mentioned before, I live in a
very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I have to actually run a humidifier
at all times, 24 seven, uh, two
[SPEAKER_02]: humidifiers actually have two humidifiers
in my lung room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, in my veg tent, I have a humidifier
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my flower tent, I don't need to run a
humidifier most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also run a, we also run a
humidifier in a veg tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of the people,
I've heard a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know my friend lives in Boston and uh,
he's, I mean, he's right on the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humidity is just naturally high.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 60% plus, uh, it's just naturally,
I know in Florida too, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people have to run a dehumidifier all
the time or else I mean powdery mildews.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're both on deck just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in case.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, with the seasons changing,
I mean winter, you know, if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: forced air in your house in the,
in the winter time, it's getting dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the winter just gets drier in
general over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's honestly a pain in the ass because if
you're not really caught, if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to the seasons,
especially if you're a new grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, you go, you have this
amazing grow because you did it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect time of season.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go to do your next grow and
you're like, you know, why, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why aren't things healthy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The seasons change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the humidity is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we keep both, keep the humidifier on
deck and the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just try to really pay attention
to the season changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have them on at all times in the
room, even if you don't need it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or do you only bust out the dehumidifier
like on certain seasons?
[SPEAKER_00]: We bust out the dehumidifier for usually,
uh, mid to late veg and then into the
[SPEAKER_00]: drying phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we don't, we don't crank it during
the drying phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you dry, your stuff too fast,
it's just not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll smell like hay and, um, not good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't crank it, but we run it in the
summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually don't run it in the veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: We usually don't have to at all,
even in like mid late veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, we, we run in the summer and the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just run it basically in late,
late, late bloom, uh, and in the drying
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, uh, the humidifier we run in the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're running it in veg actually mostly a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I just find that the veg op,
like the veg plants grow so much faster,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with good humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we don't really use the humidifier
in bloom ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, I don't really think we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, if we do, it's only for like the
beginning for, you know, a little while
[SPEAKER_00]: first couple of weeks or something.
Hmm.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, that's a good example of how
it's, it's different for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I'd never, run a dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to, uh, winter time, like you
mentioned that the heat forced hot air,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, I have a gas forced hot air,
uh, heating system.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does lower that humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, actually it was 18% the other day,
18% that's crazy, crazy low.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm constantly battling that low
humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I have to run multiple
humidifiers in the climate I live in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just a perfect example of how two
different climates, two different setups.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just gotta, uh, you know, uh,
figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much balancing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get so many growers asking me questions
about what they need to do and they live
[SPEAKER_02]: in a different climate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, uh, they, it's like
different than what I would do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's just a matter of, uh,
tinkering with your equipment and figuring
[SPEAKER_02]: it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a good segue into
discussing CO2.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, using CO2, the most ideal way and
efficient way to do it is in a sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: room, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause if you're not, if you're just
exhausting, all your CO2 out the window,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to go through tons of tanks
or, you know, propane if you're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 burner or, um, it's just not extremely
effective to run CO2 and then just like
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the long room is a fantastic way to,
uh, to, to have like a, a good CO2 system
[SPEAKER_00]: where, you know, the CO2 gets goes into
the grow tent and then it gets pumped out
[SPEAKER_00]: into the long room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that long room is going to have
a higher CO2 content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the CO2 is going to stay in there
that the plant isn't, the plants aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's going to sink to the floor
because it's heavier than air and the
[SPEAKER_00]: passive intake on your grow tent,
I assume is at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CO2 is just going to get sucked,
you know, back into the tent naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: and, uh, kind of just keep going into the
tent, into the long room, into the tent,
[SPEAKER_00]: into the long room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and you're, so you're using TMB
Naturals, um, CO2 canisters, correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, you shake those up like once a
day and they, um, do you, do you like hang
[SPEAKER_00]: it above your plants or do you just set it
on the ground?
[SPEAKER_02]: So guidance from TMB Naturals,
you can do a couple things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, number one is you can hang it above
your plants because CO2 is a heavy gas.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to, it's going to sink down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, your CO2 will sink down there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you have an oscillating fan within
your environment, they had mentioned it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fine to place it above your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did like around that, um,
either in front of the oscillating fan or
[SPEAKER_02]: behind the oscillating fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so that way it's blowing the CO2
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've just been putting it on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've hung it above my plants before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think my CO2 tank is,
uh, the canister is actually, oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: right now I need to refill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I haven't been monitoring the CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, recently I have gone grows where I've
monitored the CO2 very closely with those
[SPEAKER_02]: TMB Naturals.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of varies, especially since I'm
living in the house that I grow in human
[SPEAKER_02]: respiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm exhaling CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a roommate, I have pets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that is actually sufficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I go in my room, my lung room
alone, it's like 600, 800 PPM of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without TMB Naturals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now with that, when I got TMB Naturals in
there, plus my human respiration,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm up over a thousand oftentimes,
thousand, 1200.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I know a lot of growers, uh,
ideally they had mentioned a thousand to
[SPEAKER_02]: 1500 when you're using like a CO2 tank,
for example, which I know you have
[SPEAKER_02]: experience on and there's a regulator and
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, is that typically what you aim for or
what do you, what do you aim for when it
[SPEAKER_02]: comes to CO2 and how do you manage it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I think if people are using
supplemental CO2, they're, they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, ideally trying to hit a thousand
1200 at the very least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, before I get into the tank,
so I wanted to ask you, is there a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific reason that you decided to go
with the CO2 tank?
[SPEAKER_00]: To canisters from TMB rather than like the
mushroom bags or tanks or, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: they sent them to me, sent them to me for
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a, that's a good answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's the reason why.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen those bags and those bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard a lot of people say they're
much more effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that I think lasts for 365
days or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the exhale bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but I haven't used those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to, I used to sell them in the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked at here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't sell them on happy hydro yet,
but, um, you know, we had one set up in
[SPEAKER_00]: the store and we, and we had a monitor on
it and it kept the tent, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 900 to a thousand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pretty sure as long as the,
the mushrooms are, or the mycelium is
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, as long as it's growing,
it's producing CO2 constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically I, you know, someone can
correct me in the comments if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but as long as that bag is, is alive and
producing more CO2 and growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can last as long as you keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are, you know, it is introducing
another living thing into your room that
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of have to keep an eye on and,
and kind of keep alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you just throw that mushroom
bag two feet away from a thousand watt HPS
[SPEAKER_00]: light or something, I'm, I'm pretty sure
that light will dry it out or kill it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are cheaper methods to the bags
and the canisters.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, there's actually home remedy methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like every time, every time I
release a video, where I show the TMA
[SPEAKER_02]: naturals or talk about CO2 in some sense,
there's always somebody in the comment
[SPEAKER_02]: section who lists off a super cheap way to
do their own CO2 and their own,
[SPEAKER_02]: their own method of doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have it memorized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never tried it, but there's super
cheap ways in order to, um, create CO2 on
[SPEAKER_02]: your own without buying canisters,
bags, tanks, uh, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you, you run the tanks sometimes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You used to run the tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have, I have CO2 tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biggest, the biggest thing,
like if anyone's using CO2 tanks right
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and they're getting them from their
local hydro store and they're swapping
[SPEAKER_00]: them out at the local hydro store,
um, it needs to be known that the host
[SPEAKER_00]: tanks were inside of other grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if other people aren't clean and they
have bugs, those bugs get on the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back to the, to the grow store.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go to the CO2, you know, factory,
wherever they fill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, they come back to the
grow store and then they go to your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would tell everybody who walked into
the grow shop, uh, here in Buffalo that I
[SPEAKER_00]: worked at bleach your tank before you put
it in your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, take a, take a washcloth with some
bleach water and just bleach it down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause properly diluted, properly diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just really suck to swap your CO2
tanks out and then have a spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: because the guy before you wasn't a clean
grower or or maybe your grow store isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: the cleanest grow story, you know,
who knows, but yeah, if anything that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're bringing into your room and
swapping out regularly, like CO2 tanks,
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely recommend cleaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how much does it cost for a CO2 tank
and regulator and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it depends on where you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I, I remember, uh, tank refills were
like 20 bucks, uh, to buy the tank full
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time, I think is probably 80
to a hundred bucks, depending on where you
[SPEAKER_00]: go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and if you're in a sealed room,
it lasts what, two weeks or something
[SPEAKER_02]: roughly?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how big the room is,
you know, like if you're, and how
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient you are, like sealed room is a
very loose term, uh, because I,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people may think their rooms are
sealed, but they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's hard to get a perfectly sealed
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm sure there's plenty of people who
have done it, but, uh, there's always
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a little spot for stuff to
leak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, but the tanks, you know,
you can get three, four weeks out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tank in a smaller area.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, um, efficiently sealed and,
and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the cool thing about it is
if you hook it up to the monitor and the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller and everything, you can keep
that CO2 level exactly where you want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can take, uh, they make this
perforated hose that comes off the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you hang the perforated hose
right above your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just, you know, raining CO2 right
over your canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and since we're talking about canopies
and CO2, something that, um, we should be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of is that the plant leaves are
absorbing CO2 as the CO2 approaches,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the edges of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's only consuming CO2 right by the
leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have good circulation or
like constant flow of CO2, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is heavier than air.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, it's going to the ground at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have circulation,
pushing that CO2 around and back up,
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping your plant leaves kind of moving a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the plant is going to consume the CO2
around the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, if it's just stagnant
air, it's not going to get more CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, or, uh, some sort of, you know,
distribution, distribution system,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, dropping the CO2 onto the leaves,
ideally constantly to really get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: out of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it always kind of worried me with
the seedlings with the bag over the cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, there's no air circulation
going on there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that seedling still growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like it, when it's small and the plants
are small like that, you can kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: away with having the bag over for 24 or 48
hours, 72 hours, whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, or like you said, seed to stone has
this whole dome that he puts over.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those domes actually have a
ventilation, um, slots so you can,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah, for a short period of time
and when the plant is small, you can kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of get away with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, but yeah, you bring up a very
valid point is that air circulation is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely needed, uh, in order to,
uh, to maximize, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2 intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you were saying that like just you
and your cat and your roommate and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, like producing up CO2 in the
house and in that room, like if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: spending time in there to where you don't
need a whole lot of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on that, we can say that talking
to your plants makes them healthier,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody commented on my, one of my videos
and they're like, Oh, I just put your gym
[SPEAKER_02]: in there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You just what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Put your gym in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you'd be constantly start working out
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do pushups, jumping jacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't wear a mask in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of ambient CO2, if you don't
have a sealed room and you're,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're exhausting, um, you know,
out the window or like whatever the
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient CO2 in the, in the world is
between 250 and 400.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's closer to 400 and varies on
where you live.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it is rising.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but there's tons of like big
greenhouse grows and stuff that just can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford and don't have sealed environments
to, to, uh, implement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, external CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just use the ambient CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to do that, you just really
have to have good airflow and circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keeping those, like I said
earlier, keeping those leaves moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you, you can still achieve good yields
with ambient CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but these new led lights that are
coming out, um, such as the ROI E seven
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, they produce so much light that I'm
pretty sure that in order to get the most
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the light, to get the plant,
to be able to keep up and photosynthesize
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of light that's being produced,
um, by those, uh, they, they need CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, commercial facilities are the
commercial grow lights, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the, there's a reason why
they're, they're labeled commercial grow
[SPEAKER_02]: lights is because in commercial
facilities, they regulate CO2 and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: able to have the additional par hit their
plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there are so many home growers who
just fry the their plants with these new
[SPEAKER_02]: grow lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's becoming more and more common.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even at the proper light distance,
it's still, they're just don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, they have low levels of CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their, their plants just aren't able to
handle it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you bring up a really great point with
that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, increasing the CO2 in your grow
space, um, will allow you to intake more
[SPEAKER_02]: of that par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it allows you to deal with higher
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, your plant can handle more extremities
when it has more CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm pretty sure it can handle more
nutrients too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like it just kind of like
turbocharges the, the photosynthesis
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant can just handle more.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but you know, it's definitely not a
requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know Sundar, I could have a lot of
new growers on this channel and,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, some of them might be thinking that
they need to start implementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to the natural levels,
uh, that are there is going to allow your
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to grow just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think the amount of yield that it
increased as far as like a ROI return on
[SPEAKER_02]: investment, adding CO2 versus not having
CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a bit debatable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it depends on the, uh,
the method of CO2, how much you're
[SPEAKER_02]: actually spending, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're spending a bunch of money on
canisters versus bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're sealed, so there's too many
variables, uh, to really, um, talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, dude, when I was a new grower,
I freaking walked into a hydroponics store
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, I don't even know how to
describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just, it was like my brain shut off
and I, I, I'm no, I'm no longer just
[SPEAKER_00]: growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They made it seem like I needed the world
to grow this plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh man, it was, I didn't know what I
needed and what I didn't need,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause they just wanted to sell me
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, you're starting to grow CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, okay, well I have $300 and,
uh, the bill is 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we, what do I, what do I really
need to just get going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth is you don't need CO2 to get going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you don't need a million bottles of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, you're just growing a plant like
any other plant and, and, uh, keeping it
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as a beginner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I would have done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got, I overcomplicated things so much
that it was just, it was a disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: The moral of the story is about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like as a new grower, like it's,
it's, it's really hard to navigate and
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out like what you actually need and
what you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of the day, you need a
little nutrients, you need a little light,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need a little dirt and a little bit of
water and some good temperatures,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, the environment is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one other thing that we do
need is air circulation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's, let's start talking about that and
we'll wrap up with that one is air
[SPEAKER_02]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Air circulation is just so key for,
for so many different reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, CO2, we already talked about how it is
important for CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have stagnant air, your plants
aren't getting the optimal amount of CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: because, um, it's directly right by the
leaf is really what matters for them in
[SPEAKER_02]: taking CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So air circulation is very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had mentioned that you like those
plants to be dancing at all times.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I also aim for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I do is I'll have an oscillating fan
above the canopy or right above the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so my plants are able to sway from
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's air circulation there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also have a oscillating fan on the
lower part of my canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it's usually on the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's blowing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually have those clip on fans now
that clip directly into the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is super easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just adjust the height on the grow
tent, but above the canopy below the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy, those are two things I usually aim
for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's usually, gives good air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That plus my inline fan popping on and off
for air exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually pretty simple method.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's usually what I aim for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've run one oscillating fan in the
past and it died overnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, when I found it, there's some,
there was some bud rod that already
[SPEAKER_02]: started.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once it starts, even if you fix that
issue, it still can continue to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: within the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and unfortunately two weeks later I
harvested and then, uh, drying came and I
[SPEAKER_02]: opened it up to some, some bud rods.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, that wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But so now I'm running two oscillating
fans in my grow tent at all times.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you usually do for air
circulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just to kind of rewind and talk about
oscillating fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know that I've been doing tons of
research into oscillating fans because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to find a high quality one to bring
onto the happy hydro website.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've found is that most of these
oscillating fans, the smaller six inch
[SPEAKER_00]: ones suck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they die on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, you had one die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so, I mean, I think it's worth
mentioning that if, if any costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: if anyone out there is doing, is looking
to get an oscillating fan to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: research, I'm not going to call out brands
specifically in the video, but do your
[SPEAKER_00]: research and make sure the brand that
you're purchasing from, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a high quality fan, a high quality,
uh, oscillating fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like you said, they do, if it's a
low quality, quality fan, they do
[SPEAKER_00]: eventually die out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when they do three months worth
of work can, can be out the, out the
[SPEAKER_00]: window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's, it's saving $10 on
your oscillating fan worth risking a
[SPEAKER_00]: failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem mentioning brands if
they, if they have defective products.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that you're, I think you're
talking about is the, the vivoson or some
[SPEAKER_02]: people call vivoson.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, I don't know which way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pronounced I've been saying vivoson
and they haven't corrected me on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to run with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I've been talking with them about
that in particular, cause I did have a fan
[SPEAKER_02]: that died from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look on the reviews,
it was just flooded with people who have
[SPEAKER_02]: that fan, uh, that would die on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they had mentioned is that they
have revised that fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that issue no longer happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was happening, the root cause for
that is as the fan was oscillating,
[SPEAKER_02]: the wiring inside was constantly rubbing
up against the side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was basically kind of a
short circuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's the right term for
it, but the wiring would just get,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, the wiring would just get,
um, annihilated from moving back and
[SPEAKER_02]: forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would, it would wear out and then it
would no longer, um, have the electricity
[SPEAKER_02]: to the fan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that they fixed that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see if that new generation of fans,
if that problem is fixed or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, you bring up a great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not willing to be a guinea pig for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither, neither will I, uh, put my
customers up to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if they do fix it and, uh,
you know, they put out a good product and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I'd be happy to distribute,
uh, a quality product, but, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: until that's, you know, verified,
um, we probably won't have a Vivo Sun fan
[SPEAKER_00]: on happy hydro site right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be the guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the new one they send me is legit,
then I'll let you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get, if you get a bud rot,
I think you should send them a bill for
[SPEAKER_00]: your loss of harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be nice if I could do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you do usually do for air
circulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a cheap thing that people can do,
um, that's pretty reliable is to just buy
[SPEAKER_00]: a cheap box fan, take two, uh,
grow light hangers, hang it from the
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling and have it blowing air right
between the top of the canopy and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the light fixture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vertical, it's vertical.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, you know, I'm talking about
horizontal on the top of the grow tent
[SPEAKER_02]: vertical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the side of the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's like, just like a cheap way
to, to, to really move a lot of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a box, the box now will move a ton
of air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how did you, how do you fix it up?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like hang it from grow light hangers,
grow light hangers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it can just blow, you know,
it's not ideal for like a four by four
[SPEAKER_00]: grow tent, but if you're growing,
if you're growing in like a bedroom or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, um, and you, and you need to
move a lot of air, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: hang a bit, hanging a big box fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a, a budget way to get the job
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, obviously it's not as great as like
having oscillating fans like mounted to
[SPEAKER_00]: the walls and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, you know, that's, that's the way
I was a budget grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when I did my growing, you know,
I was between the ages of 14, don't tell
[SPEAKER_00]: my mom and, uh, 22, I wasn't, just not,
I didn't have a lot of money to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found, you know, cheap ways to do
things that worked really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and you mentioned that you put your
oscillating fan, you know, over the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and between the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another huge benefit there is those lights
are putting off heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can just pull that heat right
off, uh, before it hits the canopy,
[SPEAKER_00]: that allows you to push those lights a
little bit closer up to a certain extent,
[SPEAKER_00]: the closer that you can get the light,
uh, usually means the the deeper that the
[SPEAKER_00]: light will reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the denser the buds you
could produce up to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that's a trick that I use
hanging the box fan, cheap trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if you have the space and you have
like an oscillating, just standing
[SPEAKER_00]: pedestal fan laying around your house that
you can just use, you know, grabbing that,
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it in there is a good way to,
to just have a budget option.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that if this oscillating fan thing
is dealt with and like they have high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality oscillating fans that can clip
onto the, um, the grow tent pole,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they don't, there's there,
there are, um, I think the monkey fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, there are fans that clip onto the grow
tent pole that don't oscillate,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but still, you know, our small combat
compact, uh, and can, can push a decent
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of air into your, you know,
four by four tent or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one thing to mention about that
though, is, uh, you just gotta be careful
[SPEAKER_02]: to avoid wind burn, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Wind burn is a real thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're constantly blowing air onto the
plant consistently, the plant can have a
[SPEAKER_02]: stunting growth that dries out the leaves,
the outer part of the leaves, and you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: see the edges start to, to brown and curl
down and things like that happens to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've happened to me multiple times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also even with the oscillating fans,
uh, if it's blowing directly onto the
[SPEAKER_02]: buds, those white pistols, they turn brown
and start to recede a lot faster due to
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of air that's hitting them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you'll notice, I know that there's
some girls who have come across that in
[SPEAKER_02]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So explain that to me again quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all like in a, in what part of bloom
do, is this a concern?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I mean, really any part of bloom.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've been an early flower and I
had an oscillating fan and every time it
[SPEAKER_02]: went to one side in blue, it was hitting a
bud and the bud on that branch the hairs,
[SPEAKER_02]: the pistols went from white to,
uh, brown and started to recede.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you look at the other parts of
the plant and that wasn't the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how much that's going to actually
impact growth?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but it certainly had stressed out the,
the, the plant to the point where the
[SPEAKER_02]: pistols had turned color and receded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never thought about that, or,
um, I guess I just never noticed that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, obviously the oscillating air is
going to affect your VPD and the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is transpiring and, you know,
drinking water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I had something to say, but I'm
losing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you, if you just have a carbon
filter sitting on the ground and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a fan on top of it, like an inline fan,
and you're just, you know, scrubbing air
[SPEAKER_00]: in the room and you're sucking in air
through the carbon filter and then pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: that air straight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a good way to get to see that,
um, sinks to the floor back up and above
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's like, you know, if you're not
worried about, if you're in a sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: environment and you have an extra carbon
filter and a fan just like laying around
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're looking for a way to get like
some circulation going in your room,
[SPEAKER_00]: you could just set that on the ground with
the fan on top of it, blowing that air up,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, 24 seven, you know,
another way to just get some circulation
[SPEAKER_00]: going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll also, you know, that filter will
catch, um, some pathogens and things other
[SPEAKER_00]: than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a great, great tip for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when you're scrubbing, so,
uh, the, the only problem is if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about odors, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just scrubbing in the room,
you're not creating negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, negative pressure for those that
who aren't aware it's basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: so if you have a carbon filter and a fan
on top of it, you're not creating negative
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a fan inside of your grow tent
and you're exhausting air out of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: you may notice that the sides of your grow
tent start to suck in a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that no, no air inside
of that grow tent is just going to leak
[SPEAKER_00]: out of like the zipper or a hole or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you have negative pressure in
the grow tent, all of the air that leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow tent goes through the filter
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you remove that negative pressure,
so you're, I'm no longer exhausting the
[SPEAKER_00]: air out of my tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just, you know, scrubbing the air
inside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the filter on the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got the fan on the filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just scrubbing the air inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, air is going to smelly air is going to
leak out through your zipper, through your
[SPEAKER_00]: ports, through, uh, through whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, hospitals actually use negative
pressure rooms for patients and basically
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who, who may have some sort of,
uh, airborne illness or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they put them in a, they put
them in a, um, negative pressure room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way the virus doesn't, you know,
accidentally creep out of the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the door of that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: The airflow is constantly creating a
vacuum in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, so I think it's kind of cool
how negative pressure is used in,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, a hospital environment to,
to protect from, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens and stuff infecting humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also used in the growing world to
prevent odors from just leaking out
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever they feel like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a lesson in negative pressure.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it pretty much wraps everything
up or talk about environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about temperature, humidity,
CO2, air circulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't everything you need to know
about those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are just kind of a discussion that
we're having, uh, you know, what we do for
[SPEAKER_02]: those different things to control those,
those pieces of the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I think it's beneficial since,
you know, we live in different climates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so talking about these things,
it definitely, there's some things that I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't know that you do, which is just
awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, I'm not sure if you knew that
everything that I had talked about as far
[SPEAKER_02]: as controlling environment in,
in the desert region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it depends on which environment,
which climate you live in always,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, feel free to make adjustments as
necessary in order to get your
[SPEAKER_02]: environment's conditions into the ideal
ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, if anyone really if anyone has
any different, you know, way that they
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with humidity, temperature,
everything, tell us in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, this isn't the be all end
all, these aren't the be all end all ways
[SPEAKER_00]: to, uh, control your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's things that we miss
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please comment in the description,
let us know, like if we're wrong or if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a better way or a different way to
do something, um, definitely want to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, don't forget to
subscribe to my man, Mr. Grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the page to his channel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I was just going to say
is I would love to know how you control,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, your environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone who's watching this, let me know
down in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love reading through that and just
seeing that various ways that what people
[SPEAKER_02]: do in order to make things easier as far
as controlling their environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, slap that down in the comment
section below, hit the thumbs up if you
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, how do they find you on social
media and your website and so on and so
