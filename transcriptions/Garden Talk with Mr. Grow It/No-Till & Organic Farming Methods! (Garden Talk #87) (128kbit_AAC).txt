[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way that you would see a tropical
forest run itself or a woodland run
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I tend to think of no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not disturbing the soil and just let
it do what it was naturally designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take 30% of good native soil from
my food forest and I'll use that to create
[SPEAKER_01]: my beds because what better way to
introduce fungal and bacterial life than
[SPEAKER_01]: to take it from somewhere that's shown and
proved that it can sustain something way
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger than what you're attempting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see no point in being organic and going
no-till and still have to feed the same
[SPEAKER_01]: way that the synthetic guys have to feed
and still stay on the same cycle that they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to feed because somehow in nature
this process happens by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about mixing bottles
and nutrients and having this and running
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to deal with any of that no
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can actually just enjoy growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me my name is Chris
aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned into the
[SPEAKER_00]: Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode number 87.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Beast Coast
Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was on the podcast in the past,
episode number 34, and a countless number
[SPEAKER_00]: of you have requested for me to bring him
back for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode he talks about no-till
farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: How he goes about doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to all of you who support this
podcast through Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you'd like to support you can do so by
going to Patreon.com slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring zero cost for
information about gardening all plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to VivoSun for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: VivoSun recently released the Smart Grow
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Smart Grow system helps streamline the
growing process by automating a stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth requirements on and off schedules,
spectral range, airflow and circulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and even records useful data about your
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is Wi-Fi capable and connects to the
VivoSun app so you can control your grow
[SPEAKER_00]: space from your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their website at vivosun.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will provide a link in the YouTube
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: AC Infinity is sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two different series LED grow
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ion board and the ion grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ion board fixtures are board style and
use Samsung LM301B diodes while the ion
[SPEAKER_00]: grid series has an open center design and
uses Samsung LM301H diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: these grow lights and you can use discount
code MRGROWIT if you're buying off their
[SPEAKER_00]: website acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: That discount code works for all AC
Infinity items or discount code MRGROWIT15
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're buying off Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Beast Coast Grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoying the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're back for a second time around.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time you talked about how you do
plant training and the Scrog technique in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular, which people loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that episode had passed 67,000
views on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really have been a countless number
of people requesting you to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: For a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: This time around, we're going to talk no
till farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way that you currently grow
and I'm excited to hear all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for everybody tuning in, I'm Beast
Coast Grower 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of in a permaculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm mainly known for doing a
whole bunch of fruits and vegetables and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also co-host to the Green Table podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just good to be back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad you guys liked the first one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really simple like everybody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just somebody who fell in love with
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you've done a whole bunch of
different styles of growing in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: but right now you're into no till farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a lot of beginners and
intermediate folks that tune in my
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some advanced folks as well,
but I feel like a majority is beginner and
[SPEAKER_00]: intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might not know what no till
farming is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is no till farming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in my opinion, no till farming is
not disturbing the soil, not disturbing
[SPEAKER_01]: the mycelium layer that's getting built,
not disturbing that connection of roots
[SPEAKER_01]: that's happening inside of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some people will go through,
break the soil up after each round,
[SPEAKER_01]: re-amend it, put it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: No till is more of a sustainable way of
growing where you don't actually disturb
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil other than you transplanting back
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, no till is just letting the
earth be earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way I can describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same way that you would see a tropical
forest run itself or a woodland run
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I tend to think of no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not disturbing the soil and just let
it do what it was naturally designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the downside of disturbing the
soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly the mycelium, that fungal colony
that builds in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really want to disturb that
connection because once the roots connect
[SPEAKER_01]: to that, it starts pulling nutrients from
distances that it normally wouldn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to and the more you disturb
that, the less microbes you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: the less fungal life that you have,
the more you're going to have to amend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like now you're going to have to actually
put food back into it because you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have that same access you normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those mycelium networks can extend
for miles and miles and miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the biggest organisms on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing how big those networks
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you talked about the old growth
forests out there and I watched the
[SPEAKER_00]: documentary Fantastic Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you've seen that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy how long the network actually
extends to and the fact that nutrients can
[SPEAKER_00]: be transported from so far away into the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always weird how they discuss
microbes, they discuss MPK, they discuss a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole bunch of other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, fungal is really kind of
left out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that thing you don't really want
to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it when it comes to a lot of
mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't exactly know what you can eat
that'll harm you and what you can eat
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it comes to the plants,
this should be one of the first topics
[SPEAKER_01]: that's spoken about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt kind of cheated after I've seen
Fantastic Fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, wait a minute, have we been focusing
on a lot of the wrong things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of people are using chemicals
and salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one way of growing or there's the
organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no-till goes right with that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the media or medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for that when no-till
farming?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bunch of different ways you can
start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the way that I'm going to say a
lot of people don't agree with.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to hear a bunch of people
tell you that that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I choose to do is I like the
ProMix BX.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't know there's a different type
of ProMix.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the HP.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the high porosity one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one you would mainly use if you
were going to do more synthetic feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The BX is a heavier ProMix that you can
use that's mainly used for like no-till.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to build a system where
that soil is going to stay put,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would rather go with the ProMix BX.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, another thing I did in the beds that
I know people won't agree with is my beds
[SPEAKER_01]: are 30% native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take 30% of good native soil from
my food forest and I'll use that to create
[SPEAKER_01]: my beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what better way to introduce
fungal and bacterial life than to take it
[SPEAKER_01]: from somewhere that that's shown and
proved that it can sustain something way
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger than what you're attempting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to take 30% native soil and also
add it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also use Happy Frog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a problem with ocean forest,
but it can run a bit hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's something that I tread lightly on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I was to use it, it would be in the
very bottoms of the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the medium that I like to go
with is 30% native soil, 70% ProMix,
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe add it at 70%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe take 20% of that and use maybe Fox
Farm Happy Frog or ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or maybe another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they have the Malibu compost and
they have other ones on Build-A-Soil you
[SPEAKER_01]: can use as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I hear about more and more people
using the native soil in their backyard
[SPEAKER_00]: and just grabbing that and rehabbing it,
I guess you can call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the ProMix comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way it's not too compact because a
lot of these plants, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that oxygen is needed down in the
roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these native soils are going to be
too compact and you're just not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get optimal growth out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding in ProMix, adding in some of the
bagged soil that you use could certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: be beneficial on that avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to come with your perlite
or your vermiculite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some wood chips are going to be inside of
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be things in there that
help to aerate and let the water get
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have heavy clay soils, you stand
that chance of a lot of your water not
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to even penetrate through if
you don't mix it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the reason I only go 30% instead
of 50-50 because you can still risk
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction if you go 50-50, depending on
if you don't mix it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd rather stay on the safe side with
the 30-70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this for your indoor garden or outdoor
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to build beds outdoor,
I would build them the exact same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what else do you bend into the
medium begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some folks will do some sort of
amendments that have nutrients in that,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously, break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adding anything else into the
medium to begin?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first make the beds, there's 444.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Down to Earth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Down to Earth 444, langbenite,
kelp, and maybe some Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Epsom salt is super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something they always leave out
when it's time to amend is Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that calcium uptake is important and
you can't do it without magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make sure that I always add some
Epsom salt to them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And besides that, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beds run themselves after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and also humic and folvi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know offhand the ratios that you
use, like the amount you actually put in
[SPEAKER_00]: to the soil at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know they're supposed to be,
you use a cup of this or a half a cup of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I eyeball it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a chef where you just a little bit of
this, a little sprinkle of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that 444 be to a bulk of it of
whatever I'm going to be using because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the main source of MPK that they're
going to be getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The langbenite is really, it's slow
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the langbenite will get released later,
but that's a potassium source.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make sure that I add that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it depends on the layer because
I layer my beds like lasagna.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the bottom, there will be a stronger
layer of amendments than it will be at the
[SPEAKER_01]: top because you don't want to put plants
right into hot soil like your peppers are
[SPEAKER_01]: burned up, tomatoes are burnt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to go as light as possible on
the top because plants don't need as much
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients as they say they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really light on the top and it can get
heavier as it gets to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned you're in beds or
are you also in grow pots?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some smart pots too.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size do you use and what size do you
recommend?
[SPEAKER_01]: At least seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need at least seven
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know most people say five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five is a pretty safe zone, but when
you're going to have to keep adding layers
[SPEAKER_01]: of hay and other things, eventually you're
going to need a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to go with seven, fill it to
five and leave that last two because
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually it'd get filled up over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to deal with that and
wind up having to switch these pots out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at bare minimum of seven, but I use
20s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use threes, five, sevens and the sevens
are our easiest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's easier to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sevens are the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be trying tens and trying
for larger ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people say that the
larger the grow pot or bed, the easier it
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have 20s, but I have them folded down to
tens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And after each round, you'll notice you'll
have to fold the bag up a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: fold the bag up a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what happens over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually fold folding down the
sides of it and then kind of unraveling
[SPEAKER_00]: it, grow off to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, because you're going to have to
add another layer of mulch is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: heighten it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't want to have to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then your water is running off after a
while.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything on the bottom will eventually
turn into compost or worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what you'll be able to that
that's what's going to keep on raising the
[SPEAKER_01]: height of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hay will disappear, but it'll leave
a whole bunch of insect frost or worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when does your first feeding happen and
what does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going into the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just getting the plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're not going to get a first
feeding for a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what do you typically do for that
feeding of ferments?
[SPEAKER_01]: So FPJs will be one of the first things
that I'm going to be feeding, because
[SPEAKER_01]: after they veg for that month,
they'll be transitioning into the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, that's when I want to I
want to boost the potassium, the
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus, everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll go with FPJ feeding FPJ fermented
plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you're doing a natural farming
technique there for your first feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about FPJ and like how you go
about doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes sense for me to do ferments
because I'm vegan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So most of the stuff that I'm throwing
away is reusable anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mainly just ferment the fruits and
the vegetables separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vegetables that I ferment,
that's for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fruits that I ferment, those are for
bloom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you wind up with two almost separate
nutrients and you can use them at whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: stage that you want to that works best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just normally never need them in veg
because they don't take a lot of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: in veg, especially in big beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my ferment process is actually to take
the fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use brown sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use white sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like agave.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why I like agave,
but it's just something I always have on
[SPEAKER_01]: hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take the agave, let it sit for a
week and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: After a week and a half, strain it,
take the juices from it, dilute that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably like three milliliters to a
gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'll use to feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the shelf life on FPJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Truthfully, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said the longer you sit, sometimes
the better it gets if you can store it
[SPEAKER_01]: properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I try to make mine small batches at a
time so I don't have them sitting around
[SPEAKER_01]: too long and wind up just having to throw
them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do them as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the meantime, any of that extra
stuff will just go into the worm bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I know I want to do a feeding
coming up within the next week or so,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when I'll go ahead and make the
FPJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you just following like the
recipe that say Chris Trump, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's a well-known natural farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: On YouTube and he has step by step
instructions on how to do the technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just following his technique or is
there some other thing that you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: besides what he does?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a mixture of what I can from some
of these people and what I can't because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have access to different live plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have like some people use banana
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no way for me to get that
where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bananas just don't grow where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just try to fuse the two.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll take some of the stuff that I have
access to from some of these people and
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of it is literally just kitchen
scraps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes life the easiest for me
because I know that if you're thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: like cantaloupe, you're talking about
something heavy in phosphorus and
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big bulky fruit, you know,
phosphorus and potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone knows bananas are full of
potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try to think of it by nutrient value,
like what's inside of these fruits that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be using and what part of
growing would I like to add these in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I may be a little different than some
of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your first feeding is FPJ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I assume that you're
kind of already flipped a flower at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're doing fermented fruit juice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As your second feeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot there's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the fermented fruit juice and the
fermented plant juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say that the plant juice is for veg and
the fruit juice is for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of people that do the
natural farming techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they've been doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could just make a full spectrum
blend and you basically have a one part
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient that you can use all the way
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you doing a third feeding
after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I try my best not to have to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's rare that I feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm straight water from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if they go check the rounds that I
have recently, those are ran off water for
[SPEAKER_01]: the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll feed if I decide to, but if not,
they still, they still hold steady.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's mainly just the microbial feeding
or if I want to boost the bacteria or
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi or something, but they don't exactly
need the feedings after you build the
[SPEAKER_01]: beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you, if you've got the worms in there
and if you're doing the method that I use,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you're constantly making worm
castings and foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you know when, how do you know
when to feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really up to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in week, if you're in week
two or a flower and you're trying to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more flower sites or more flowers to
develop and you want to boost that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you see, you see it and you think you just
want to boost that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and add a feeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get into week five and you want to
do a little bit more bulking, feel free to
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and use this same way that you
would use any other PK booster is the same
[SPEAKER_01]: way that you would use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only difference is you're not feeding
in between time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only targeting those specific
points where you just want to boost
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I see no point in being organic and
going no till and still have to feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: same way that the synthetic guys have to
feed and still stay on the same cycle that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to feed because somehow in
nature, this process happens by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no one's there feeding anything and
yet these trees grow to hundreds of feet
[SPEAKER_01]: and they do just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to replicate that same method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people doing the natural
farming technique and no till,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're also doing like some people
use the organic blends and they'll top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress at certain times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically somebody would do, you know,
30 days into it, they'll do a top dress
[SPEAKER_00]: and every 30 days after that, they'll do a
top dress and they'll just really just top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress and then water after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be like the similar
frequency to what you're doing with the
[SPEAKER_00]: ferments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So would you say that's just kind of an
alternate way to go about the no till?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ferments are readily available
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the reason that they have to feed 30
days in or the time after that is because
[SPEAKER_01]: that has to take time to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm going to want to feeding week
two, I have to go two weeks back and
[SPEAKER_01]: already amended.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two weeks later, they're finally
starting to uptake it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's finally broken down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's finally available when it comes to
ferments.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I feed today, they took that today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to worry about it again
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I'm watering afterwards,
I'm pretty much just diluting what's
[SPEAKER_01]: already in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a big difference there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's definitely a pro having that
readily available.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if you've got a problem and you
need to fix it because in soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: the hardest thing is running into a
problem because sometimes it can take days
[SPEAKER_01]: before you can fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might take weeks before that fix
shows up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're running low on nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You add some nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two weeks later, they'll finally start
greening up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the two weeks in between that,
your plants ain't going to be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people start off organic
and they run into the point where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing deficiencies in their plants and
they'll top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like you said, you got to wait those
two weeks in order for it to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a lot of people know about
the alternative of FPGA and FFGA,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ferments, and then being readily
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of resorting back to synthetic
nutrients, that fast acting stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I think a lot of people doing might
want to consider going after a ferment
[SPEAKER_00]: since that is faster acting than just top
dressing and waiting until the organics
[SPEAKER_00]: break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a cheat sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I need something right now and I
know that I created this ferment out of a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of greens, I know it's loaded
with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I feed this right now, they can
uptake this nitrogen right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I decide to give them some 444,
it's going to be a week or two before they
[SPEAKER_01]: get ready to uptake that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something else is most people aren't
dealing with deficiencies when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dealing with toxicities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you'll go get your happy frog or
whatever you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pop your plant in, but you're also
going to run the Fox Farm nutrient line
[SPEAKER_01]: right along with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they don't tell you is to add water
until that runs its course because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of food in the happy frog and the
ocean forest already.
[SPEAKER_01]: So imagine you're trying to feed on top of
everything that's already available there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wind up burning your plant,
but it shows up like a deficiency because
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't tell the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think most people are not dealing
with deficiencies depending on what
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're dealing with toxicities and
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into it 10 years ago, 12 years ago
when I first started, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: not realizing that the dark, dark green
leaves are actually toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Toxicity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you running into any toxicity
issues using FPJ or FFJ?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, because I don't use it often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're controlling it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I used it more, maybe because all
the nutrients are also available in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil, but I haven't ran into that problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, I'm really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to go as light as possible on the
plants because there's so much available
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're adding things like
ferments that is feeding the microbes and
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteria, they start releasing more
nutrients available for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to really worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the synthetic way of us learning
just has us thinking we constantly have to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep feeding or eventually they're going
to run out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's so much food available in that
soil that you wouldn't believe it,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in a bed and a pot,
maybe not as much, but you in a four by
[SPEAKER_01]: eight bed that holds hundreds of gallons
of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where having a bigger container
can make things easier because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: more availability, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you mentioned worms in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a little bit deeper into
that because a lot of people are utilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: worms and either containers or beds when
they're growing organically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are several different types of
worms that you can use, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Red wigglers, European night crawlers,
African night crawlers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for worms in your beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I choose the red red wigglers,
but I also do add earthworms as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they serve two different purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Red wigglers are mainly going to be at the
top.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to deal with the compost and
the things that land on that top layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to break all of that down,
turn that into castings for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The earthworms, on the other hand,
they're going to stay a bit lower and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to eat the peat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They eat other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They handle other processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for that top layer to get broken down
as fast as possible, you're going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: the red wigglers or the African night
crawler.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to want the smaller worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thinner worms are mainly used for
compost and the bigger, thicker worms are
[SPEAKER_01]: mainly used for compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're mainly used to create tunnels and
do other things inside of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do a mixture of both, but I mainly
focus on the red wigglers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now are you just getting the worms from
your native soil, that 30%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that include worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you outsourcing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you buying it somewhere, whether it be
from a local Walmart in the bait section
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, or ordering it online?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Uncle Jim's worm farm is a common
source that a lot of people go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get your worms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uncle Jim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get my worms from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am still adding worms all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if it's a rainy day and I know it's
done raining, I'll go out, lift some
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks up, take some of those worms and
bring them right back in as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to keep them reproducing instead of
having to keep on adding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they're free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll pay for them the first time when I
add them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, I'm never paying to add
worms again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to give them every reason to
stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People add worms and give them nothing to
do afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're going to add composting worms
to it, but you're not giving them anything
[SPEAKER_01]: to compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually they're going to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to start digging through your
soil and you won't find worms anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to wonder what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you sent a bunch of workers to a job
site and there was no work to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went home.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started vermicomposting last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got about a year under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I'm at the point where I can
actually just take some worms from my
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicompost bin, which is now a year
round thing, and then put it into my
[SPEAKER_00]: containers as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good way to have them on hand at
all times is have a vermicompost bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then every time that you have to clean
it out to harvest the castings and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, when you add those castings,
they're going to have a bunch of little
[SPEAKER_01]: worms and eggs and stuff inside of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to re-inoculate the bed
full of worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you got a layer for them to
live in, as long as you got some bedding
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to live in, they'll handle the
rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I added a thousand worms per four by
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people would have said use
a whole bunch more, but no, I added a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand per four by eight, gave them a
proper environment to live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's more than I could ever
count.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll lift a layer, and it's
thousands of worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because they'll reproduce,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to make contact with each other
and then they reproduce that way or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they lay eggs too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see them all through the hay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you lift it, they lay a bunch of eggs
inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people use an avocado
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you've heard about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the way to attract the worms
into one area, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll go after the avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they're making that contact,
they're reproducing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can get faster reproduction just by
putting an avocado face down onto the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that works too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for cover crops and when
do you plant them?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as I make the beds, I make a layer
of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the very first thing I do before
any other plants are going in before any
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow a really thick layer of
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really thick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like purposely, I'm going to let it
overgrow itself because that's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the first layer of food and mulch for
those beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once I hay that over, that becomes
the first layer of food going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that layer of cover crop that happens
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hairy vetch, the daikon radishes,
the red clovers, the snow peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like a 20C variety that I use
and that's what I go along with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did you get the 20C variety?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it locally or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a non-GMO pack from Amazon,
a cover crop, and it was like a 20 seed
[SPEAKER_01]: blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I showed it on my Instagram or
something, the actual pack of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of people buying the 12 seed
blend from Build a Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be very popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used that before too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That works well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just in a rush and I needed it
faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I chose to go with Amazon to get them
because I needed it faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Build a Soil one works perfect as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you're planting the cover crops
right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the cover crops growing up,
you have to eventually cut it back,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you make that call to cut back
your cover crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: When they pass the ring of the bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a distance between where my
soil starts and where the actual bed is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they pass that arm rest basically on
the beds, that's when it's time to hay
[SPEAKER_01]: them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people just cut them back,
I hay them over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the first layer of
food.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worms and bugs are going to love me
after I smother that underneath there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to go crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that turns into just a massive
layer of worm castings later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'll go back at the end of that
round and then to just be black underneath
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's another source of nutrition,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you put that mulch layer over it and
it dies off and the worms are going after
[SPEAKER_00]: it and the microbes and all that stuff is
turning into usable nutrients that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant can uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of it, the plants themselves
that winded up getting hayed over,
[SPEAKER_01]: their roots start to release nutrients
once they notice that the plant's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll start to let go of some of the
nutrients that they've been holding onto
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're watering in a worm casting tea
every time you give fresh water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can say that I'm not feeding,
I'm just giving them fresh water all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but I'm not just giving them fresh
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's such a big layer, a thick layer of
worm castings underneath that hay that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: watering in a worm casting tea every
single time that I water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just using the hay as a mulch
layer?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different things that
you can use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you're just using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it barley straw or what exactly is it?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people use alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of different ones that
you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, but on top of that, I still do
chop and drop too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go to leaf strip or I lollipop
and clean the bottoms, all of that goes to
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes right to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it go on top of the mulch layer or
are you lifting up that mulch layer and
[SPEAKER_00]: then sliding it underneath?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a new layer of straw, then I'll
purposely go underneath and put it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes a little while for that straw to
flatten.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's already been in and it's kind
of flat and compacted already,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll just throw it right on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll still serve its purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually it'll just disappear or it'll
turn into a black spot on top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that'll let you know that it's
now a bunch of insect frost and worm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use wood chips as a mulch
layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you done that at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like wood chips because since I
have to transplant back into these beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: I never want to risk these wood chips
getting mixed back into the soil because
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll start to leach nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll cause a whole bunch of issues
being inside of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only good for the very top layer
of your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was outdoor, then maybe I would go
with wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have as much of a problem with
it, but indoor I'm not even messing around
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to go with straw.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I used wood chips, it's literally
because I put them outside to inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: them with some microbes and brought them
back afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only time I'll be using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of water do you use when doing
no-till?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using all-row water, distilled tap
water, well water?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you using for a water source?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to chew me up in the
comments over this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get what everyone's big issue with
the tap water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go look at your lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go look at your garden in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go look at anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's tap water that's doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tap water is not the worst thing in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think mine comes out at around 225 or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's all calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever it's not, I have mycelium to be
able to disinfect it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's antibacterial properties inside of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not exactly too worried about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you learn what mycelium actually does
with one layer of skin compared to ours
[SPEAKER_01]: with seven, you start thinking about
things completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I willing to waste a five-to-one ratio
on our water?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not willing to waste five gallons of
tap water to make me one gallon of usable
[SPEAKER_01]: RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm cool on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just tap water right out the hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mine comes out at three to one,
but still, that's crazy as far as the-
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm wasting three gallons just to
get one of possibly some better water,
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tip for anybody doing that, you can always
take your drain line of the RO,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it into a bucket, use it elsewhere,
your outdoor plants, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are like, oh, you're wasting
it with RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people's drains are going right back
into a local water municipal system,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not really being wasted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I had bad water, I hear some
people's PPM at the time, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't use that either.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine is 485.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would filter that in some way,
shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if I created my own charcoal
filters or no matter, some way,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would filter that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, mine comes out at 485 PPM,
so I'm just like, I've got the RO system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in your case, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a little bit safer because if I
get through, if I start watering my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, I've done this before,
I water it with tap water, trying to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants are struggling, and I need the
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need the end result off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm messing on my plants, all of a
sudden quality goes down the drain,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, that now my stash is going down the
drain too, somewhat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I safe-side it, although I am revisiting
the whole tap water and trying to use it
[SPEAKER_00]: straight from the tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to get some sort of result in
there, and I'm hoping that organic,
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till, that I'll be able to get away
with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just depends on what's coming out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're getting a bunch of iron in your
water, you're going to come out with a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem that you won't even recognize.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll look at it and be like,
am I over-watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I under-watering?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen another grower deal with it
where they were trying to keep the water
[SPEAKER_01]: from the dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would use the water from the
dehumidifier, and they were wondering why
[SPEAKER_01]: the room kept on having problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was because the extra iron that was
coming through the coils of the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier, that iron was in the water,
and just the smallest percentage of it was
[SPEAKER_01]: burning the plants because they don't need
the amount of iron that's coming out of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a small percentage to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a large percentage to a plant that
doesn't exactly need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had worse water, then yeah,
I'd have to have some kind of system to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting that that grower came
across an issue where iron was leaking in
[SPEAKER_00]: through their dehumidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually come across studies where,
I think it was by Quest dehumidifier or
[SPEAKER_00]: humidification systems at company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a study on theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did testing and everything seemed to
be clear on multiple dehumidifiers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a biased source, I guess you can
say, because they're selling that
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quest also has a completely different
system than the person who was using this
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier was using.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't a Quest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they tested other brands as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget exactly what the ... Oh,
and they found out that it was cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: They found out it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think copper was like, there was trace
amounts of copper, but that was it,
[SPEAKER_00]: parts per billion or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very small amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to revisit that study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting that that grower came
across that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moment that they stopped using the
water that they were reclaiming from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier, the problem went away in the
garden like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could have just been their
dehumidifier, but there's just instances
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're going to need a filter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not just one of those people that's
just all or nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to be for the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that and I love that, but if my tap
water's coming out at 480, I'm doing
[SPEAKER_01]: something about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't just feed that to my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix three bottles of nutrients and it
comes out to 480.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't have that coming fresh out the tap
into my plants.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the elements, some cations,
if there's the excess of some elements,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can lock out other elements,
inhibit the uptake of other elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a whole bunch of cations of
calcium, for example, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibiting the uptake of magnesium or some
of the other cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That balance is certainly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you pHing your water?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think my pH of the water is like 6.3 or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes out in the range that is
acceptable for the plants that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the langbenite and stuff like that
buffer it once it gets inside of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine by the time it touches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the water out of your tap came in at
8.0 pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you pH adjusted?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm lowering it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I just lucked up and winded up with
a situation where everything just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: worked the way it was, but I know
everybody's situation isn't going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if your tap water is coming out way too
acidic or way too alkaline, do something
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be as natural as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a natural way to lower it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's natural ways to lower your pH as
well, but the pH up and down ain't the
[SPEAKER_01]: worst thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get your pH in range to make sure that
your plants are happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end goal is to have happy
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't be so encased in, I don't want to
use anything that you're willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrifice the round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people worried about using those few
drops of phosphoric acid lower their pH
[SPEAKER_00]: and they think it's just wiping out their
micro population, which isn't true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just some misinformation that's been
passed along generation to generation and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been debunked over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, those folks that are in living
soils, growing organic you can use a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of pH up and pH down and it's
not going to drastically harm your
[SPEAKER_00]: population to where your plants are going
to be all screwed up and you're not going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get a harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not going to destroy all of your
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to destroy your fungal
colonies and all other funny stuff that
[SPEAKER_01]: they decided to tell you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of that is going to happen over a few
drops of some pH up or down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not the end of the world and you
guys being like 30 gallons like,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're worried about a few drops like,
no, it isn't going to make a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do you incorporate any sugars into
your garden at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: When I feed the ferments.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just that, you're not doing any,
like some people do molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's in the ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there, there's no point in adding it
separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I, if I want to do a sugar feed and
I'll just add some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of one less step.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only time I'm feeding that anyway
is late in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no other time where the
plant's going to really need some sugars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you adding in any microbial inoculants
at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: IMOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go and get the microbial
inoculants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no specific product of microbial
inoculants, but you're doing IMO,
[SPEAKER_00]: the IMO process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you actually break that down for those
that don't know what IMO is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So outside in nature, there's plenty of
fungal and bacterial life.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you know how to go and find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, uh, they they'll sit like
rice out or something and they'll collect
[SPEAKER_01]: it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people will take the leaf mulch,
lift it up, find the fungal colonies,
[SPEAKER_01]: take that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I cheat and either use a paper bag or
cardboard on a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let it sit out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll go back later on,
lift the cardboard and it'll just be
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in fungi.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll shred that into pieces,
bring it back up, let the worms go through
[SPEAKER_01]: it and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll inoculate the beds themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never heard about that cardboard
technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cheat sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've got some dirt, just go out
there, laid it, lay it down, let it rain
[SPEAKER_01]: on top of it or water it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you come back in a few days later,
as that box is kind of sort of starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down, you'll lift it up and it'll
just be covered with fungi on one side of
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have to try that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the desert, so I'm like,
oh yeah, dirt out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be, you'll be surprised what you
can find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe that'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that'll bring up some of those
microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then maybe I'll be able to use them in
my garden in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause now they're protected from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they have something they can latch
onto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll be surprised how much of it it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was shocked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when I first seen the method done,
I went and tried it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then afterwards I looked and I'm like,
yo, I think everyone should know about
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I even took the dirt layer that was
underneath it because that was fully
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in mycelium afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I even took that with me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool that that works.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about aerated compost teas or nutrient
teas, plant teas, manure teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do a tea probably once every couple
of rounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll make, it's mainly just for root
health is what I'm doing it for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for readily available nutrients
or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mainly just for like root health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll do like stinging nettle,
maybe a little bit of neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, and maybe just some worm care.
[SPEAKER_01]: Castings are some IMO or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the most I'm going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to keep it as simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I didn't want to take no till and
turn it into synthetic growing all over
[SPEAKER_01]: again by having to do five, six different
things throughout the stage of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my entire last two rounds was just
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even feed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the teas that you do just to dig a
little bit deeper into that, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: brew the tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like, you get the mesh,
put everything inside of there and brew it
[SPEAKER_01]: just like everybody else hang it off the
side of your rez.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let it brew for 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, what I missed what it actually
consists of.
[SPEAKER_00]: It consists of worm castings and then you
said neem in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Neem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll use neem for root health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also a good nitrogen source and
stinging nettle, because one thing you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to worry about and no till is going
to be fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a nice, easy way to get rid of fungus
gnats is to brew stinging nettle teas
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't stand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you water in stinging nettle teas
and tea or soil, you're kind of decreasing
[SPEAKER_01]: your chance of having that fungus net
outbreak because it'll destroy them for
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the most I'll do if I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm not telling no one to not do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please use all the aerated teas that you
want to the more the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not going to tell you guys not to
do that, but I just don't do it often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is just your style of growing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a good question for the
audience actually tuning in right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing no till or if you're
growing organically in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: what way do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know down in the comment section
below some of your techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do the same techniques as Beast
Crows Grower here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you doing your own thing?
[SPEAKER_00]: A different way to go about it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love going through the comment section
reading and just seeing the different
[SPEAKER_00]: methods that are out there because it's so
many.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they poke holes in a lot of your
theory sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like sometimes you'll have a way of doing
something and somebody will be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, instead of that, why don't you just
try this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, genius, genius.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did I not?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did I not think of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how did I not see myself running
into this problem or that problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I still watch a whole bunch of no till
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I know it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love all of the no till growers out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Queen is sun grown, full of knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like that I nerd out on all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into that before we wrap
things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this wasn't on our original list of
questions, but if you're comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about it, you know, one of the
common concerns of people going to
[SPEAKER_00]: organics or going to no till is that they
think they're going to have bugs more
[SPEAKER_00]: prone to pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do anything in particular in order
to prevent pests?
[SPEAKER_01]: The native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll you'll find the area that is
loaded with plants and you will see mite
[SPEAKER_01]: damage on some of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see mildew on some of those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see bugs eating on some of those
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll see a section that's just
pristine.
[SPEAKER_01]: That lets you know that there are
predators there in large numbers keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: the pest out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the soil from that section that's
going to bring in all of the predator
[SPEAKER_01]: mites and everything else that I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if need be, I would also release
predator mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the most I would do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to stay away from spraying anything
and no till situations and I just haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: had no bug problems, mainly because I
brought the good bugs to fight the bad
[SPEAKER_01]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people want to fight it with a spray
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have time to be doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of spraying, especially when
you got dense canopies and you tight
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to be going in there
spraying all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just make sure that I find areas when
I bring the native soil that like I would
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically look for areas heavy in bug
damage and then I look for an area that's
[SPEAKER_01]: not heavy in bug damage that's nearby.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll know that this area has more
predators than that area, apparently,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can see the damage done to one
and not done to the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want the area that has nothing done
to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best way I can think of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I know I'm bringing a whole bunch
of predators and I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've looked at them under microscopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's predators all over the
place in my garden and I'm perfectly okay
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would release some too if I didn't
have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be my IPM right there is to
release predators are used like a JADAM
[SPEAKER_01]: spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe use a JADAM wetting agent would
maybe like a compost tea or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're safer soaps that you can use and
spin a sad and the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like doing all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so far so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I run into that problem, I may wind up
using a different product was so far so
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting up towards the end of the
episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple more things I want to ask you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any advice on no-till farming
that we didn't talk about here in this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode or just general advice for
beginners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your best to maybe use beds if you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the pots do work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pots work amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to be doing no-till
and this soil is not going to be going
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere anyway, then just go ahead and
use the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no point in still cleaning up your
floors in between all of these pots and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything when you could just have if you
got a four by four tent they have four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got a five by five tent, they got five
by five beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no point in doing pots if
you don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now if you may have to move these plants
at some point in time, you got inspectors
[SPEAKER_01]: coming through or people coming by,
you might have to move these one day,
[SPEAKER_01]: go ahead and use your pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if not, use beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of save yourself from over
watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little harder to over water and
that because you're just kind of going by
[SPEAKER_01]: judgment of how much water these beds need
and they hold a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of hard to over water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants don't need as much
nutrients as you're thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another word of advice that I'll
give you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you're going to do anything close
to the method that I said where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: amending when you make the soil or you're
starting with a super soil, use fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: water and maybe Epsom salt for as long as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let the nutrients run its course because
you're going to start feeding in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get dark green leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to deal with nitrogen burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to deal with all sorts of
problems if you go ahead and start feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: like you're in a synthetic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That nutrient needs to run its course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent less is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you guys heard, I dilute the ferments
three milliliters per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a lot at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a lot at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yet it's more than enough because
we're talking about a pure concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at three milliliters a gallon,
it's still plenty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have yet to venture down the FPJs and
FFJs, but it's on my list of things to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think probably next grow is when I'm
going to try it out for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited because it's something I
haven't done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gardening for 12 years now and I
haven't done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's actually still other ways of
growing that I haven't done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just doing these different ways,
it's just been so fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I encourage folks listening
in, just have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try not to get overwhelmed with all the
different ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try one way and then see what happens
and make adjustments from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because check back last episode,
I was in one gallon pots of cocoa on
[SPEAKER_01]: tables with watering systems and said soil
grows too slow and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outdoor, I'm a 100% no-till grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, I have an extra room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just try no-till indoor and just
see how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to go with the stun method,
sheer total utter neglect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to build these beds the way that
I'm thinking I'm going to build them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to give the plant straight
water the entire round just to see how
[SPEAKER_01]: much nutrients is actually here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went the entire round and it was
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Converted all the other rooms to no-till
after.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just how it happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was more fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It freed me up on more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about no watering
systems getting clogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about mixing bottles
of nutrients and having this and running
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to deal with any of that no
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I can actually just enjoy growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, definitely a big change from last
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually recorded that first episode
October of last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one year ago is when we actually filmed
that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely have that episode
linked down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're on one of the podcast platforms,
just search for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me Beast Coast Grower 420 on
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can also find me Sundays at the
Green Table podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of organic talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of regenerative agriculture talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of ways to show you guys how to be
more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a game where it's forcing you to have
to be more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like eventually there's going to be no way
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's almost no way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to become as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this method is the most
efficient method that there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No-till in some way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or organic gardening in some way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me is going to be more viable than any
other system that you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: using.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of that coming up and more
episodes with the Green Table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, definitely I have a link to your
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend I'm releasing one of
these new Garden Talk podcast episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love for you to tune in to
future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beast Coast, once again, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for coming on and spilling
your knowledge about no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last episode we had was the Scrog
technique and you killed it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this episode is a lot of great
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well, something completely different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks once again.
[SPEAKER_01]: One more thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still using that exact same Scrog
method.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the same Scrog technique that I was
talking about using with the one gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: pots of cocoa in the water, I still use
the exact same Scrog method now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I transferred that right over.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that changed was the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, same to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
