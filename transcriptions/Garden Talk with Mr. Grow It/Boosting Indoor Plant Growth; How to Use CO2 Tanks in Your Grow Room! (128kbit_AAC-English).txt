[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little different when you're
running CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I also don't just, if I want,
if I can avoid it, I don't want to just
[SPEAKER_01]: dump all my CO2 straight out of the
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think where a lot of people
steer themselves the wrong way is they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement CO2, but then they'll have
their inline fan kick on exhausted all out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into CO2 a little bit deeper
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you supplement CO2 using the tanks
or use in one of the other methods?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I've used, I've never tried the
little cans, but I have tried the,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are they called?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember the name, but the little
mycelium bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had those, I've ran them more than
they recommend you to run them,
[SPEAKER_01]: like more in my space than they say you
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seemed like for me personally,
in my limited experience, I could never
[SPEAKER_01]: really get the PPM of CO2 I was looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the highest I ever got with three
of those bags in a five by five tent was
[SPEAKER_01]: like 860 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now I have got, I just run a 20 pound
tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 20 pound tank right outside of my
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an automatic controller that goes
in the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little fan in that controller
that's always pulling air through the box
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting a CO2 rating on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can set my high and low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then if I set my low to say 800 and
my high to 1400, as soon as the CO2 dips
[SPEAKER_01]: below 800, the electronic valve will open
and that tank will start leaking out CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just piped in through a little small
air hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This run right to the very top of my tent
because the CO2 is really heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I run it up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal is to have it fall down and as
it's falling through the canopy,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these fans towards the bottom of the
tent are just gonna keep it moving all
[SPEAKER_01]: around the leaf surfaces so they can just
use it all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because your leaf can really only use the
CO2 that is like right there touching the
[SPEAKER_01]: leaf surface on the top and the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always wanna be moving it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after you get it set up, after I have
this set up, it was a little expensive to
[SPEAKER_01]: set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The controller is a little expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: The valve isn't very expensive,
but the electronic controller is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first CO2 tank I think was close
to 200 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way it works is it's just an
exchange program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now every time I want to go get more
CO2, I just take my empty tank to the grow
[SPEAKER_01]: shop, drop it off and pick up a new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't refill it or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have full ones there waiting on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that price to refill that is very,
very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm paying under, I think it's like $15.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so small that I don't even know the
exact price because usually when I add it
[SPEAKER_01]: to whatever else I'm getting from the grow
store, I'm not sure how much it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was under 20 bucks is all I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the potential that you can get in
your growth, and not just your growth,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not always about biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always about plant size.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, I like the CO2 really because it
makes my plant, it just seems to make the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant more hearty in every way I can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to make it more resilient to
drought stress, more resilient to heat
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, more resilient to pest and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can get faster plant growth,
that's always great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I'm not going for a bigger plant,
I always like to get to harvest quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can save a little time, that's always
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me time to start a new round.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's a study out of Utah State
University where they ran 1400 ppm in the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering stage and they got a 30%
increase in yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was Debaco University covered
that on his YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see those pictures of those
plants, you're like, well, that's clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clear as day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the clearest thing I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you realize it, and for me,
it was really like, what really made me
[SPEAKER_01]: look into it is when I realized how many
of these big commercial facilities might
[SPEAKER_01]: cut corners to save money here and there
and there and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're cutting corners to save money
wherever they can, but never ever,
[SPEAKER_01]: ever on the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CO2 is running all day, every day,
really high 1400, 1500 ppms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because they've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because they've had a room that had a
few hundred plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had a room right beside it
with a few hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they only had enough CO2 one round to
run it in one room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they saw the difference in these two
rooms and they were like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was 30% more money came out of the
same size room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can never make that mistake again.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good can come out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although it is upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: He mentioned $200 for the tank to begin
plus hundreds of dollars for the
[SPEAKER_00]: controller valve, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff, but it's for itself pretty
quickly there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you running it daytime only?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will just do CO2 in the
daytime and they'll say, ignore it during
[SPEAKER_00]: nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the controller I have is actually set
up to run exactly that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has it's monitoring two things at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is the fan that pulls the
air through and reads the actual ppms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing is just a little light
monitor right on the front of the
[SPEAKER_01]: controller box.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and you put that inside of your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anytime there isn't a very bright
light source, like if your grow light
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't turned on, then that thing just
defaults to stay off all night long.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all during the night or all during
lights off, it's not putting out any CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as soon as the lights come on in
the morning, it just starts all over
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
