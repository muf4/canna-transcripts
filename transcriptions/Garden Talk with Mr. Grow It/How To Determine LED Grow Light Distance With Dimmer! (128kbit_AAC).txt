[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and today I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: topic video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By far, one of the most common questions I
get here in 2021 is, what should my light
[SPEAKER_00]: distance be when using the dimmer on my
grow light?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to this can be a little
tricky since not all grow lights are
[SPEAKER_00]: created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dim down to a certain percentage on
one fixture, you're not going to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: same power output as dimming down to that
same percentage on another fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a few things that you can do
in order to make an educated guess on what
[SPEAKER_00]: the light distance should be when using
the dimmer at different levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm going to get into
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get into the video,
I want to give a quick shout out to our
[SPEAKER_00]: sponsor of today's video, Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to Mars Hydro for sponsoring this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check out their multi-chamber tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow tents are becoming more and
more popular since you can have plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetation stage in one chamber and
then flowering plants on a different light
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle in the other chamber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars Hydro also now has inline fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have four inch and six inch versions
using either a thermostat controller or a
[SPEAKER_00]: speed controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one last thing to mention is that
Mars Hydro is now using Samsung LM301H
[SPEAKER_00]: diodes in their FC65 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are arguably the best diodes on the
market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will leave a link to their website down
in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use coupon code MRGROWIT for a
discount on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's get into the topic today,
which is using the dimmer and determining
[SPEAKER_00]: what the grow light distance should be
from the top of the plants to the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really three steps to determine
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, the first step would be to
look at the grow lights par chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these days, all good grow lights do
come with a par chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find that on the grow light
listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to touch a little bit on what
par is on this video, but I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: separate video that gets deeper into par
talking about exactly what par is and also
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple of different ways to measure it
PPF and PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I won't get too detailed in this video,
but on the outro card of this video,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll link that video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in case you guys want to watch that and
learn about PPF and PPFD more in detail,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really what par is in layman's terms
is really just a range of light that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant uses for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photosynthetically active radiation is
what it stands for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on your grow light listing,
this should be a par chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should really be kind of a square and
there should be different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with many of these new grow lights are
going to have different charts for
[SPEAKER_00]: different light distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, a lot of companies used
to mislead consumers and they used to just
[SPEAKER_00]: put the dead center number and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd know the strongest point,
the dead center of the footprint,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that measurement was, but you
wouldn't know any other measurements on
[SPEAKER_00]: the footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days, full par charts are available
again with any good grow light on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first step is to look at
those par charts and get an idea of what
[SPEAKER_00]: the PPFD numbers are for each of the light
distances that they list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next step is to understand the general par
ranges for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it depends on what plant you're
growing, something like leafy greens,
[SPEAKER_00]: lettuce, kale, spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to need a lot less light
than some other plants, which require
[SPEAKER_00]: highlight for the plant that we all know
and love.
[SPEAKER_00]: General ranges are 200 to 400 PPFD for
seedlings, clones, and mother plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to 600 PPFD for plants in the
vegetation stage and 600 to 900 PPFD for
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're supplementing CO2,
you can go higher than those numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those are just general ranges.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are supplementing CO2 and
giving your plants more light,
[SPEAKER_00]: your other conditions have to be dialed in
temperature, humidity, and of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've looked at the par charts on the
grow light listings and you're seeing the
[SPEAKER_00]: different distances there and what the
PPFD numbers are at the different
[SPEAKER_00]: distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're aware of what the plants
requirements are for the different stages
[SPEAKER_00]: of growth in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the last step is to do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I tell you this step, some of you
are going to be like, oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: why didn't I think of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then others will be like, oh,
yeah, that's common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, why wouldn't you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, there's a lot of people that
don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured I'd make a video.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I get that question about
what the light distance should be with the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimmer, I can simply forward people this
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, if you're looking at the par
chart and at the light distance of 12
[SPEAKER_00]: inches, dead center PPFD is 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the dimmer at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you turn the dimmer down to 50%,
what's 50% of 1000?
[SPEAKER_00]: 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a rough estimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, this isn't going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are going to be a lot of variables.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a grow tent and you have
reflective walls, they could skew the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers versus if you're in an open space
and you don't have those reflective walls,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, then you're probably going to get
different measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is to give you a general idea
of what the par output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 12 inches, 1000 PPFD at 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turn it down to 50%, 500 PPFD,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of that 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what if you're at 12 inches,
1000 PPFD dead center, you turn the dimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: down to 80%, 800 PPFD, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So 80% of 1800 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there may even be some people that
comment to this video and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you dim it down to 50%, it's not going
to be 50% of the 100% value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did actually put this to the test
just to prove it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take a look at the results right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one up is the ESL.
[SPEAKER_00]: 180 LED grow light by the green sunshine
company at full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It pulls 200 Watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that on my kilowatt meter
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my part meter is showing 485 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you divide that by two, what we're
looking for is 242.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's round up 243 PPFD is what it should
be at 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I'm dialing the dimmer down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing my best guess to estimate where
the 50% Mark is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also using the kilowatt meter as a
guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close as I can get to halfway as 98.5
Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then looking at the par meter that's
showing 250 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's very close.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only about seven PPFD off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this example was pretty solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The SF 2000 LED grow light by spider
farmer, full power here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows 202 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my par meter is showing a 515
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we dim it down to 50%, we should see
about 258 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the dimmer is set to 50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's showing 200 PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a little bit off there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about 58 PPFD off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely still within the ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wouldn't say it was wildly different
by any means.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the 50% was actually showing 72.3
Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually a little bit less than half.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just one last thing I wanted to do was
dial it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is exactly 50% via Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was 202 Watts full power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dimming it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The closest I could get it was 99.3 Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the dimmer that actually shows 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the PPFD is about 266.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you're seeing the measurement
go up and down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, this kilowatt meter is actually
something that can help dial in that
[SPEAKER_00]: halfway mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I spent around 20 bucks for this
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not too bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how many times I have to say
this because I just have a feeling that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are going to be people in the
comments section that say, this isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to give you a general idea of what
the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you could always go out and buy a
power meter and take measurements that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video is really for the folks that
don't have the money to spend on a power
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally have the Apogee MQ 500 power
meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it runs about $525 for that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It measures from 400 to 700 nanometers,
which is your traditional power range.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to measure LED
grow lights as well as HID grow lights
[SPEAKER_00]: with that power meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have the Apogee MQ 620.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is an extended range power meter
measures from 340 nanometers up to 1040
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually going to go into UV as
well as go up into far red IR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this meter was about $575.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe $575.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are cheaper power meters on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more accurate than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's also apps that you can use
that you can actually measure power
[SPEAKER_00]: directly from your smartphone with those
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more accurate than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually about to release a garden
talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Podcast episode with Shane from My Grow
LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he talks all about measuring PAR and
he talks about some of the alternatives to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Apogee PAR meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that episode is released,
I'll link it down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below and also put it in the outro
card as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll have that PAR video that I spoke
about and also have that episode with
[SPEAKER_00]: Shane from My Grow next to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that helps some of you that don't
have the money to go and buy a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should now be able to make an educated
guess on what the grow light distance
[SPEAKER_00]: should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: When using the dimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up and we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
