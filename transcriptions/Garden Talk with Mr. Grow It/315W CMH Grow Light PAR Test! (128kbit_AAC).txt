[SPEAKER_00]: What is up everybody, feed that don't on
me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: today I got a part test video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a 315 watt CMH grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a vertical bulb in it, 98%
reflective material, built-in ballast,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this actually covers a three foot by
three foot grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got this one straight from the
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at an expo in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: The name of the manufacturer is Cinewell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the spectrum looks like
or what color temperature the bulb is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately they don't list that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the listing description I'll list this
link in the description section below so
[SPEAKER_00]: you can click on it if you want to learn
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the Apogee MQ-500 quantum
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to give PAR measurements in
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this part test video I will of course
let the measurements do the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do distances at 12 inch,
24 inch, and 36 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the most common distances for
CMH grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's just get into the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright there are the results for the 315
watt CMH light, the one with the vertical
[SPEAKER_00]: bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty standard measurement there for a
315 watt CMH.
[SPEAKER_00]: 36 inches is what I would run for
seedlings, clones, 24 inches of veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then 12 inches for flower,
although I might even go up to 13 or 14
[SPEAKER_00]: inches since that dead center reading was
about 1100.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like I mentioned in the last part
test video, you can get away with 1100 if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're running CO2, but just keep in mind
that you can experience some burning in
[SPEAKER_00]: that dead center because that is a little
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know if you guys are running
CMH grow lights, what distances do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have your plants in different stages of
growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have lots of videos coming up,
more part test videos, I think I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: like six more videos, so I hope you guys
are digging these so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
See you next time.
