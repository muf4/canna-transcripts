[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fungal life moves in on things that it
likes such as fats and lipids and avocado
[SPEAKER_00]: being one of the most fattiest fruits out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just time and time again I found that
writhing ball of worms forming underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: a half an avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite ingredients,
pumpkin seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumpkin seed is extremely high in
phosphorus and purees beautifully into
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a nut butter if you will and
folds into that avocado really nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use Bokashi to do an anaerobic breakdown
of my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried thermophilic composting where
you're trying to obtain you know a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature to break things down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works fantastically and I'm having
results that are amazing honestly with
[SPEAKER_00]: just maintaining my system that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be surprised how just a spoonful of
certain things can really be sufficient to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you exactly what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka Mr. Grow It and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast
this episode number 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode I interview Blue of Green
Tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 25 years and is
the creator of Avocado Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll talk about what Avocado Tech is,
how to implement it and some things that
[SPEAKER_01]: closely relate to it such as mulch layers,
cover crops and auto watering.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I am joined with Blue of Green Tank.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, how are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are well known for avocado tech which
is a very interesting technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super glad to have you on here today to
talk to us all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to get into things that
kind of work along with it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So cover crops, we'll get into mulch
layers, auto watering, things that really
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of help with avocado tech in
different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited to get into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the nitty gritty and
get deep into that part, can you just tell
[SPEAKER_01]: us a little bit about yourself and kind of
how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have been a hobby gardener for
most of my life and then as I progressed
[SPEAKER_00]: into a variety of different crops,
medicinal plants became sort of a focus of
[SPEAKER_00]: mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I looked for ways to streamline what I
was doing and that's really where the
[SPEAKER_00]: technique that I've shared with everybody
else, particularly on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: has come into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have been a medicinal caregiver for
a number of years and before that just a
[SPEAKER_00]: hobby enthusiast and now looking in
towards doing it as more of a profession
[SPEAKER_00]: along with my other professions that I
maintain at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a wine and beer specialist,
that's my family trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that for over 20 years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started my journey by going to culinary
school shortly after high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flavors and discerning products and
things like that have been kind of my MO,
[SPEAKER_00]: my entire professional career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this past year was able to open the
first adult use recreational store in my
[SPEAKER_00]: county in the state of Maine, which I'm
excited to share with the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: At large.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I am today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we started recording, you mentioned
that you've been gardening for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a ton of knowledge and it's
not just medicinal variety, but you've
[SPEAKER_01]: grown other types of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the favorite plants that
you typically grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been into food crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I, like I said before,
I have pictures of just being a little
[SPEAKER_00]: toddler in the garden, sitting around a
Swiss chard and all mannered of edible
[SPEAKER_00]: heartier crops in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a shorter, colder season,
but a big fan of many different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: brassicas, all the tomato family.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown hundreds of varieties of
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have zucchini, bush beans are a favorite
of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's medicinal, edible greens,
you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm interested in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's dive into avocado tech now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're most known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tell us, what is avocado tech and how'd
you come up with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Avocado tech is essentially a method of
maintaining a good soil biology and also a
[SPEAKER_00]: manner to feed plants indirectly through
soil decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically came up with it through
working in my own home garden,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for ways to streamline what I was
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not have a lot of infrastructure and
ability to compost during the cold months
[SPEAKER_00]: here and I started to kind of think to
myself, why can I not do this in
[SPEAKER_00]: container?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I read more into composting at the
time and started to come up with a way
[SPEAKER_00]: that I thought that I could obtain what I
was looking for, for feeding the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to do it all in container and not
have to have worm bins or other
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure that would have been a
little more cumbersome in my situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how it kind of started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I kind of went down on a rabbit
hole of what I consider to be the fruit
[SPEAKER_00]: drop theory and also the law of return as
far as container gardening goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what fruit drop theory is,
is that in the natural world, a plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrifice a portion of its reproductive
nature to feed itself and the soil biology
[SPEAKER_00]: to maintain itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the law of return is just simply
kind of goes hand in hand with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's returning a portion of what has been
cultivated back into the system and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it can maintain itself for the next
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now can this technique be done in a
non-organic system?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, those folks that are out
there using the synthetic bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you use Avocado Tech with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there are some aspects of it
which could benefit that style of
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my focus, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more of a living soil gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you could probably facilitate
there would be bringing a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: biology into your system and also
maintaining that biology source so that it
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously inoculates the system,
even though the conditions aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily the best for that type of
biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see these videos of Avocado Tech
happening, whether it be on your Instagram
[SPEAKER_01]: or there's a lot of people now on YouTube
that are doing it, you pull out that pod
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's loaded with worms and different
types of insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you need worms and or insects in order
for this to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at them as definitely the workhorse
of the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's a more complex and more
beneficial aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real heart of it is that you're using
microbiology to aid in decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, you could use
fungal inoculants and bacterial inoculants
[SPEAKER_00]: to break down what you're choosing to put
into your filling, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'll get to that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worms, microarthropods, arthropods are
definitely the workhorses of the situation
[SPEAKER_00]: and you will see the most complex return
based on usage with those guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are several different types of worms
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which type of worms work best with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some of the faster workhorses
would be red wigglers, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great composting worm, works the surface
of a substrate and tends to be pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: voracious, but I also really like to push
diversity in what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using European nightcrawlers and now I've
actually moved to using a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the African nightcrawlers as well in a few
different systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work different levels of the
substrate and they actually can even hand
[SPEAKER_00]: down material that's been worked by the
other to the next and that can be really
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial in a system and again,
the diversity of the biology and moving
[SPEAKER_00]: your inputs around within the soil
substrate is definitely accomplished
[SPEAKER_00]: better when you have more workers in doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even expanded to beyond worms as well
through sort of happenstance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like millipedes, even the
woodlouse, which is so controversial.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people call them pill bugs or
isopods.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are organisms like that which will
absolutely aid in the essential digestion
[SPEAKER_00]: of the ingredients that you're adding and
get them into your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that a broadcast is the best
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get as many people, as many organisms
doing the work for you as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a bunch of people do this
indoors, avocado tech indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: can also be done outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's probably a different set of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, outdoors, you don't have the
control and so there's more organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: around and they may want to jump in on the
party.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to take into
consideration where you're doing this,
[SPEAKER_00]: what your plot is like, what kind of flora
and fauna you have in your area and they
[SPEAKER_00]: may or may not want to take part in this
decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some things you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the most frequently asked
questions are, I have rodents or have ants
[SPEAKER_00]: or I have some things that might be
opportunistic and want to jump in on the
[SPEAKER_00]: party of decomposition, whether it be just
straight up eating what you've put down or
[SPEAKER_00]: tampering with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to help with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've suggested flat rocks to go on top of
your avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps protect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also suggested folks, and I've
practiced this myself, is submerge the
[SPEAKER_00]: pod, as I like to call it, a little bit
more down in the soil and maybe even mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: over it and that way it's just not so
obvious to organisms passing by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing would be to really
pre-inoculate your filling with some great
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal life, some voracious fungal life
that may just get that work going and get
[SPEAKER_00]: it done before you're essentially putting
out bait for something to attract
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you may or may not want.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can absolutely be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it with success this past season in
a greenhouse that would keep doors open
[SPEAKER_00]: and no other real safety measures to keep
things away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with the rapid decomposition,
I did just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the process a little bit
deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many avocados are you doing per plant
or per container?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably best to backtrack of how I
came upon this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regular process of learning
composting, you take note of how things
[SPEAKER_00]: break down in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a little bit of Bokashi,
used Bokashi to do an anaerobic breakdown
[SPEAKER_00]: of my product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried thermophilic composting where
you're trying to obtain a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature to break things down,
but I really wanted to stay away from both
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things because thermophilic
composting can get too hot and can
[SPEAKER_00]: actually be detrimental to soil organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bokashi, of course, can also be anaerobic,
which is not always a bad thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you can avoid it, certainly it is a
good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: With avocados, I noticed just through
trial and error that my worms were
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely attracted to the decomposition
of avocados more so than any other thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that I experimented with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That got me really thinking, man,
what is it with avocados?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it really comes down to is that
fungal life moves in on things that it
[SPEAKER_00]: likes, such as fats and lipids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avocado being one of the most fattiest
fruits out there, just time and time
[SPEAKER_00]: again, I found that writhing ball of worms
forming underneath half an avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, before I started it,
I had halved an eggplant in half,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was attempting to use an eggplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed that they gathered, but they
were fleeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would disappear after a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led me to having the avocado and
putting that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just found that that dome of the shell
of the avocado kept it nice and dark and
[SPEAKER_00]: moist underneath there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a situation that the worms
loved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led me towards the avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then beyond that, I had children that were
young at the time and in high chairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to sneak veggies and foods that
they wouldn't normally eat to them through
[SPEAKER_00]: pureeing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the idea of mashing some of these
dry amendments that I would have liked to
[SPEAKER_00]: top dress with into this guacamole of
sorts, and then like a twice baked potato,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it back inside and putting it
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found rapid decomposition of that,
whether it be mechanical or digestion
[SPEAKER_00]: through fungal life or worms or whatever
it may have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hatched through observation,
basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I want to stress that there
are many other domed fruits that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use in place of an avocado that work just
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That avocado does have some secret
properties for sure that the worms just
[SPEAKER_00]: love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you just apply one avocado per gross
cycle or multiple?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you lay those down?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to stress that more is less.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be cognizant of where your
soil is at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have people hitting me up all the time
wanting to employ this technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first question is, what's your
substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old is your substrate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of 10, these are people
with a first use soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to stress that you should be
striving to build a complete soil to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're building a complete soil or
you're purchasing a complete soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: it should be fine for one cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I like to start employing avocado
tech would be in the second cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not to say that you can't do it in
the first cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think it's a little bit redundant,
but people are always thinking more,
[SPEAKER_00]: more, more, more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what I like to do is I use one
half of an avocado per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to position it down near the stalk,
but not directly on it or touching it,
[SPEAKER_00]: not too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a drip emitter system, a blue mat
style system that drips on top of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shell of the avocado, maintaining the
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can obtain the same thing by mulching
it or just hand watering it frequently,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the easiest way for me because
I get consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have done through trial and error
is timed putting down one half an avocado
[SPEAKER_00]: to complement three parts of the plant's
life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, I put one down in what you
would consider the vegetative portion of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tailor what I fold into the avocado
or other dumb fruit to the vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will do a second one about a week
or two before I want to switch to the
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I will use a third and final one
about 20 days into the flowering cycle
[SPEAKER_00]: just to push the ingredients that I would
like to see being utilized in the soil at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time for ripening and for finishing
and flavor and secondary metabolites and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and oils and whatever plant
you're growing that you'd like them to
[SPEAKER_00]: produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure that those ingredients are ample
in the soil should the plant call on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people that are in a living soil
system, they're in larger containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 gallons is generally said to be the
smallest container you want to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are in 20 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are in beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: What container size do you suggest for
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the smallest container that can be
used for this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that the rule of thumb,
especially in living soil, is the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: soil container, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's more buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just the ability to create a more
complex system in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I have on my Instagram
gone so far as to document containers as
[SPEAKER_00]: small as two gallons with the avocado
tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason being is this dome fruit
principle can really act as a hub to
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously keep the inoculation that
you've used going in your system because
[SPEAKER_00]: there is that moisture, there is that
continuous breakdown that you have going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can really maintain a soil system in
quite a small container.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing is, again, you don't have
that buffering capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are walking a bit of a tightrope as
far as you have to stay on your moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure that the organisms
that you're using in there make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using European nightcrawlers
that are six inches to a foot long,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to get crowded in a two-gallon
container pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to probably be very
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be smart with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, I prefer beds because I just
feel that's the way you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the most complex soil system going.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way you're going to have the
most longevity with the soil system that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to create and make it easier
to maintain the diversity basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, going back to the actual avocado,
you had mentioned that there are sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: other amendments you added to what you
call, I believe, a mash.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other amendments are you adding to
the pod?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you tailored it to the
vegetation stage and then you also have
[SPEAKER_01]: your own thing for the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what actually
that consists of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm going to sound like a broken
record in that diversity, diversity,
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, I don't like to add too many
things, but I like to bring a focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the vegetative stage, you're looking
for maybe a bump of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for a bump of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for maybe a few growth
stimulants, something like a kelp would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a nice ingredient to use at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the beautiful thing about this is
the sky is really the limit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilizing soil testing can really help you
hone in on exactly what you may want to
add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, with organics, the results aren't
absolutely immediate, so you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on maybe a few weeks ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best part of this vermicomposting that
we're doing is that once these ingredients
[SPEAKER_00]: pass through the worm's gut, and some do
and some do not, some are mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed in just by the worm's body moving
around, but they can be made plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available very quickly, especially when
you've pre-inoculated with some type of
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi and bacteria that's working it,
pre-digesting it in a way, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: worm's coming through and eating the
fungi, bacteria, and their byproducts and
[SPEAKER_00]: really making a plant available even
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a mix, and I like to be smart,
and I like to use several different forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the same ingredients sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I may use gypsum dust for
calcium, and I also may mix in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: oyster flower, oyster shell flower,
excuse me, just to give it a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: slow release.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has to be a little bit of thinking
ahead with this aspect, but other things I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to use, malted barley is fantastic
because the fungal life is really
[SPEAKER_00]: attracted to that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can add a sugar source if you like,
although I like to really go low and slow
[SPEAKER_00]: on that, and we can get into why later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your molasses, your agave, there's a lot
of different things that you can use to
[SPEAKER_00]: spur the microbial life popping off a
little bit quicker and also to feed your
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant that you choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indigenous microbes are fantastic,
but you can purchase them as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many, many varieties out there
that you can use, but I like to use a good
[SPEAKER_00]: mix of a bioinoculant and then a couple
targeted nutrient sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to flour, you would maybe want a
continued bump of calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to be a pretty consistent
theme.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then moving into something like
phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my favorite ingredients is pumpkin
seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pumpkin seed is extremely high in
phosphorus and purees beautifully into
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a nut butter, if you will,
and folds into that avocado really nicely,
[SPEAKER_00]: as do sunflower seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a great bump of phosphorus
leading into when you might want to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into your branching and spreading out of
your plants and really setting the stage
[SPEAKER_00]: for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I know a lot of people are listening
to this and they have living soil systems
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're wondering, is this the only
thing you really need to feed your system
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just do an avocado and veg with
your mash, with your amendments mixed into
[SPEAKER_01]: the pods, and also same thing in flour,
and then that's it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you also doing top dressing of
different amendments throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I felt it was really important when
I was developing the SOPs, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: for this to attempt to grow completely
with avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the more, I'm not going to
say controversial, but it's a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: polarizing as far as people who are using
it just for propagation of worms and
[SPEAKER_00]: maintenance of the worm population,
and even just maintenance of the
[SPEAKER_00]: biological population of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there's the other side of actually
completely feeding with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it's a little bit more
complicated when you feed solely with
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado tech, but it works fantastically
and I'm having results that are amazing,
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly, with just maintaining my system
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be surprised how just a spoonful of
certain things can really be sufficient to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you exactly what you're looking for
in this type of gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that you're in a bed,
and from what I've heard, you've been in
[SPEAKER_01]: that bed for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many runs have you on now in that bed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my 15th cycle right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have solely fed with avocado tech for at
least the last eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm attempting to prove my theory now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not only that, there's a lot of other
people out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just check out the hashtag avocado tech on
Instagram, and you'll see a lot of folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who are using it and proving the theory
along with me with fantastic results.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say that there's no other
maintenance involved because that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: a lie, but that is the primary source of
feed and for amending in my system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we move on to auto watering,
mulch layers, cover crop, you did mention
[SPEAKER_01]: that you've tried other fruits as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about the other fruits
you've used and your experience using
[SPEAKER_00]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: A big part of avocado tech for me and
sussing it out in my own brain was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: research on ingredients or on different
fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds that were
[SPEAKER_00]: high in specific nutrient profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was led early on to things like pumpkins
and not only in the pumpkin seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but pumpkin itself because it itself is a
dome fruit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a whole host of the curcubit
family, which would be melons,
[SPEAKER_00]: squash, things of that nature that worked
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those were some of the first ones that I
experimented with it after using the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that impetus was I wanted to move
towards more sustainable ingredients that
[SPEAKER_00]: I could produce myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in an area that can support
avocados.
[SPEAKER_00]: I initially moved to try to work with my
grocers, people that were throwing away
[SPEAKER_00]: culls, restaurants, places that had
overages or were not using them,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than just going out to the store
and purchasing something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to reduce that carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that the pumpkin seed worked so
well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about working pumpkins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, pumpkins, generally being
larger, weren't the best fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since then, I've looked at using little
sugar pumpkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have used, I particularly like spaghetti
squash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that to be a fantastic source
because it has that shell that you can use
[SPEAKER_00]: time after time, which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had experimented with coconut,
which again, not grown in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the husk on a coconut, the shell works
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of some other ones I
might have used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melons, I'm a big fan of cantaloupe,
honeydew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to grow some little mini midget
melons this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's musk melons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Melons are a great source and particularly
good in the latter stages of flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: because they are very high in potassium
and have a lot of micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can be great for producing secondary
metabolites and oils and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen way back on your Instagram,
I think it was April 1st, you started
[SPEAKER_01]: using hot dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Want to talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that one got me into a little bit of
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was obviously an April Fool's joke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took it a little over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went down into my kitchen and got a
probe thermometer, a digital probe
[SPEAKER_00]: thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually put the probe into the hot dog
and made a little hole in the soil before
[SPEAKER_00]: I started the video so that it was
perfectly laid trap, ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got this straight face on and I did a
post.
[SPEAKER_00]: Suggesting that I had found the silver
bullet of plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the video, I perfectly
placed the hot dog into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just perfectly goes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I acted like this was some type of
instrument that I was going to measure if
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilic composting started happening
and things were getting too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would beep on a timer and let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is I really got a lot of people
hitting up my DMs about actually using it
[SPEAKER_00]: and probably hurt a few folks' feelings
when I explained to them that it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: load of BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got me for a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, wait a minute, is that a hot
dog?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, what is going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you kept on talking, I was like,
there's no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it was a brilliant April Fool's
joke for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take yourself too seriously,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, I'm just looking
for a method to maintain the soil that is
[SPEAKER_00]: easy and is effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just can't be too serious about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about auto watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that you use the blue mat
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also use blue mats as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you're setting up the carrot so
it's dripping directly down onto the pod.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about the auto watering
system, how it works with Avocado Tech?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is definitely one of the keys,
I think, to optimize Avocado Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a greenhouse as well that I use the
blue soak watering system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know, essentially,
it uses this tensiometer system,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is just basically it senses the
water tension in your soil and will open
[SPEAKER_00]: up a valve when the tension becomes low
enough and releases more water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as that soaks into the soil,
the tensiometer senses it and closes the
[SPEAKER_00]: valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the blue soak is, it's a soak tape
that's hooked to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still using the same mechanism to
read the soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just distributing it in a wider way
and a little bit more passive way,
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use both with Avocado Tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think I still prefer the straight
carrot and drip system because I like the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that it's dropping aerated water over
this dome and it's cascading down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think you get a good aeration
aspect to it as a secondary benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the worms really enjoy it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That said, as long as you employ the blue
soak and mulch, I find that you get a very
[SPEAKER_00]: similar effect as long as you nestle your
pod, as I like to call it, in an area
[SPEAKER_00]: where there's going to be ample water and
the mulching just helps facilitate that
[SPEAKER_00]: whole situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it optimizes the whole setup
and I do feel like you can attain some
[SPEAKER_00]: results that you might not be able to
attain otherwise without it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then for mulch layer, what do you
typically use?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's constantly evolving with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a topic in itself, honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big proponent of mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main reasons is retention of
moisture in general and facilitating a
[SPEAKER_00]: zone that worms will like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that where do you generally
find worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flipping rocks, moving leaves aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: They prefer dark, wet areas and mulching
just helps facilitate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing is that in almost all soil
systems, or ones that I'm familiar with,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least, there is a sort of changing of
the guards as the seasons change as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: what is acting as a mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grasses work fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood chips work fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've even used mushroom, spent mushroom
fruiting substrate, which could be bran.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be sawdust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I do like to do is I like to have it
kind of ever-changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from generally me reusing
leaves and foliage from the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm growing, mixed in with some ... That
would be my greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then my browns might be some mulch or
straw of ... Mulch with wood chip or
[SPEAKER_00]: straw, generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those seem to work really well and
definitely facilitate the breakdown of the
[SPEAKER_00]: avocado tech aspect faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also a proponent of this chop and
drop method, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain that method, what that is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what I'll do is ... Cover
cropping is a method.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several different ways to kind of
do it, but you can get what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially a green manure by doing a
green cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you chop that down, then I like to
then again mulch over that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will really facilitate the breakdown
of that green material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll really get a nice bump of nitrogen
and micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's into your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody who's into living soil has
certainly heard of the usage of clover,
[SPEAKER_00]: vetch.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole list of things that would
be really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dichondra is another one that is very hot
right now for people looking to sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: have a living mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sometimes take it a little step further
because I'm in a smaller system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will use edible plants sometimes to
accomplish the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may do a patty pan squash or a zucchini
or cucumbers or something like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll time when I seed those into my system
so that they have ample light and are
[SPEAKER_00]: choked out by my target crop, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a great way to sort of cover the
bases of getting foliage down on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground to create that moist dark zone that
I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will incorporate that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ever-changing, ever-evolving thing
with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is part of the key to my
success is that it is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, for instance, my mulch layer is
woodchip.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a hard woodchip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will then eventually seed some companion
plants into that and sort of have it
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve again and then become a green lush
kind of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to switch it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that putting in various browns and
greens will just create diversity in your
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people don't know that
you're pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people prune their plants for
airflow purposes or for defoliation,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just throw those away when
really they can cut them up and put them
[SPEAKER_01]: right down onto the top of the medium,
use it as a mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That will break down and be available
nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people don't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think there is a little bit of a
misconception that that could be sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: dangerous practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I suppose without some checks and balances
in mind, it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are worried about, oh, well,
if there's a fungi or a mold, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: eating on this green material,
well, then it must want to eat my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important to just do your
research on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the diversity helps as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just making sure that you're stacking the
deck with organisms that you know to be
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That really won't leave a lot of room or
word edgewise for some of these bad
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms to get established and get
moving in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another kind of key to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that some people might think that
the environment has a strong relation to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a specific environment that needs
to be there in order for this to happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should the temperature be?
[SPEAKER_01]: What should the humidity be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually what I meant to touch on
in what I was just speaking about in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last place, is that if your environment is
on point, it's going to actually work with
[SPEAKER_00]: you to kind of stifle some of those bad
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your airflow to be on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want your temperature and humidity to
be on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That entirely depends on what kind of crop
is your target crop and what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that you're trying to really
promote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need to straddle the line
between a couple different species to make
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the earlier vegetative stages,
I like to run more hot and wet,
[SPEAKER_00]: so to speak, and I'll get my temperatures
up around 84 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go anywhere 70, 72 humidity,
but not much up past that with very good
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow incorporated in that and also very
good air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm turning the air over in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: As quickly as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'll see the most rapid
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to facilitate rapid growth
because I am a scrawl or screen of green
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and I grow with a trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my goal there is to spread my canopy
as far and wide as I can in as short
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what really facilitates that is higher
temperatures and also higher humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really important component to
what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as things progress, I slowly back
that down into a more reasonable range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll get into the as low and I'm
talking daytime temperatures here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not as concerned with the swings in
temperature day and night, as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of a gradual shift.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that as with anything,
anything abrupt can cause issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like to do it slow and low,
so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll back into the into the low 70s
and I'll back my humidity sub 60 humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, good airflow, good air
turnover, and I never ever have any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything below 60 is really going to kind
of stifle growth of molds, mildews and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even the beneficial bacteria is
going to slow down movement as the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature gets lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll of course slow down breakdown
of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And negatively impact the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of brings to a broader topic
as well as I like to say that I'm striving
[SPEAKER_00]: to instead of having a Lamborghini or a
Ferrari as my soil, I'm looking more to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a cargo van as my vehicle in my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm able to throttle it again with
that temperature and humidity a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of how fast I can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really a slower, more even breakdown
of decomposition seems to be more much
[SPEAKER_00]: more beneficial in staving off any kind of
nutrient hunger or what I call rapid
[SPEAKER_00]: growth deficiencies, which I grow with LED
lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really rev up the metabolism
of the of your plants through not only
[SPEAKER_00]: feed, but environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's really important to
sort of have a lot of diverse tools
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the back of your cargo van
than it is to have your two seater that
[SPEAKER_00]: can zoom but runs out of gas really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where I find a lot of people in
vermicomposting even and in living soil
[SPEAKER_00]: run into issues with their soil becoming
primarily castings and such is because
[SPEAKER_00]: that engine is revving at too high a speed
and the system just can't keep up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms in the system can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in turn, your plants can't keep
up in a broad sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And speaking about that, that's certainly
a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avocado Tech, you explained, it seems
pretty easy, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just by the way you explained it and you
can put it down, but people have to be
[SPEAKER_01]: come across problems every now and then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what problems can people potentially
come across doing this method and how can
[SPEAKER_01]: they not come across those problems in the
future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a little bit of an
intuitive aspect in it, but if that aspect
[SPEAKER_00]: eludes people, there's always me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I find that I answer a lot of
questions on a daily basis, a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, and I try to get to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's certain questions that I just
kind of politely, flatly refuse to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a lot of plant diagnosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's this look like to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think this is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't like to do diagnosis from afar
because it would be silly of me to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that because I can't see every factor
and I really can't take the time to suss
[SPEAKER_00]: out every factor of everybody's question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the problems that I see people
run into are they don't take into
[SPEAKER_00]: consideration that they're adding dry
amendments to something that's moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same principle is cement.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dry mix and you add liquid to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reverse happens as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take something that's liquid and you
add something that's a dry powder or solid
[SPEAKER_00]: to it and it will absorb moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problems that I've seen in some
people's systems asking me why the worms
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't balling up underneath and
congregating would be that they've added
[SPEAKER_00]: too many dry amendments and then it has
pulled the moisture out of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore is kind of messed with the
texture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And texture is important to the worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, again, want an atmosphere that is
moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're kind of mixing up a dry,
quick cement, it's going to get pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: unappetizing to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that it won't break down over
time and not to say that the fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: element won't move in and break it down
over time, but it just won't be that
[SPEAKER_00]: seamless breakdown and that really sort of
dynamic situation going on underneath your
[SPEAKER_00]: pod.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mainly it's been that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only other thing I can think of is
that people have... I haven't seen any
[SPEAKER_00]: problems arise from it, but I've had
people say that they've had pods that they
[SPEAKER_00]: thought went anaerobic because the aromas,
the smells that were coming from it were
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily appetizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I explain to them is
decomposition is not built for the human
[SPEAKER_00]: nose to be pleasant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decomposition can put off all kinds of
aromas that might not be your favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I really suggest for people
to use something like a Bokashi,
[SPEAKER_00]: which has the particular microorganisms
that will deal with an anaerobic or
[SPEAKER_00]: aerobic kind of situation underneath the
pod and can really help break things down
[SPEAKER_00]: and you won't see anything too detrimental
in your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So never seen anything that's been a big
problem other than it's sort of not living
[SPEAKER_00]: up to the standards that I show on social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice do you have for growers who
are just getting started with avocado
[SPEAKER_01]: techno?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you went over so much advice
throughout this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything else that you can think
of?
[SPEAKER_00]: One would be take it slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The avocado in itself is perfect feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There really is no reason to load it with
everything but the kitchen sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful feed when it breaks down
by itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a young system,
a system that's not particularly mature,
[SPEAKER_00]: just have an avocado, take a fork,
mix it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, use a ripe or rotting avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to let it sit out until it rots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get some free microorganisms already
working on that thing and you can really
[SPEAKER_00]: still benefit your system just using a
plain avocado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that's the way to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no real investment other than
obtaining that fruit and giving it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, use the amendments
that you decide to add in sparingly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that you would be shocked at how
much a teaspoon or tablespoon of some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these dry amendments can really influence
your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, when it's right underneath that
plant, you're really targeting that one
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in that system and that rhizosphere
where all that biological interaction is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on right there next to your roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the most important part
and place where you want to have that go
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can definitely find me on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram is where I do most of my
educational aspect of what I do and also
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of broadly showing you what I'm
up to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is the at blue underscore of
underscore green tank, one word.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can always search avocado,
hashtag avocado tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will bring you to most of my
posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have that attached to it as well as many
other growers that have that attached to
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have coming up in the future is my
new business venture is Mary Stem LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is an adult use retail shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my my aim is to not only work with
some of the best and brightest farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Maine and showcase what their
potential is, but I would like to parlay
[SPEAKER_00]: that into a small house brand of my own,
which will utilize avocado tech to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the plants that I will hopefully
be able to get into the adult use market
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exciting, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Congrats on your new venture there.
