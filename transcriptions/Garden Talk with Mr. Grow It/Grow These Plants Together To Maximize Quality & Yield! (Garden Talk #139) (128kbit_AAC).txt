[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 139.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Natty Newfy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for five years and
grows a wide variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has a ton of knowledge when it comes to
companion planting, and that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get into in today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks about what companion planting is,
pros, cons, some great plant combinations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so much more.
[SPEAKER_00]: These podcast episodes are broken up into
small clips and placed on their own
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated YouTube channel called Garden
Talk Clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a YouTube channel where I show
the plants that I grow.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back and I'm joined with Nadi
Nufi.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk all about
companion planting, something you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of knowledge on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really excited to get into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many benefits to companion
planting, which we're going to go over,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think the main ones are that people
can think of is to help achieve a better
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and to help achieve a higher
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into those details.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus more in this episode, but first,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, gardening was all medicinal in
many ways, whether it was like growing my
[SPEAKER_01]: own medicinal herbs and things like that,
or if it was just the mental space of
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to go out and get into the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had a horseback riding accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're closing in on maybe like 10 years
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I broke vertebrae in my back, broke some
bones, messed myself up pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of led me down to the path
of trying to garden my own at home
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine to kind of alleviate some of
those symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the gateway, you know,
went from electric lettuce to next thing I
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I'm growing like calendulas and
confries and all kinds of different
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are now talking about
companion planting because I can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of growing like little indoor
jungles and stuff now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's been it's been a fun gateway
that opened up like the floodgates and now
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't I can't get enough of it turns out
got a bit of a green thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry to hear about your back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad you made a recovery there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like your hat, by the way,
if others listening in, they can't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: says only soils kind of like the only fans
logo is soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's I only grow I only grow my herbs
and top quality soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've also your YouTube,
you've got a YouTube channel, you're on
[SPEAKER_00]: the FCP channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about those
things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, I just I just kind of started
in on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just vlogs, long winded vlogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a good gift for gab.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I kind of I've been doing the Instagram
thing for five or six years, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really hard to capture that,
like the true person.
[SPEAKER_01]: The personality of somebody in like,
you know, 10 to 30 second clips and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to ramble.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been doing some vlogs over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every Sunday, 11 a.m., we do Cooked
and Caffeinated over on FCP where we take
[SPEAKER_01]: a whole wide variety of guests from,
you know, anything from gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: anybody who's been kind of getting into
this for medicinal needs or whatever it
[SPEAKER_01]: may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just kind of we just let the let
the conversation roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: No script.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just two people getting to know each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just do that over a little bit of
coffee early on a Sunday morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, we're doing that now for for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really that's probably one of my
favorite things is just connect with the
[SPEAKER_01]: community like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tuned into a couple of the Cooked and
Caffeinated shows, and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely something like a nice
morning show, you know, and it made it to
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can say that light something up
and drink some coffee and just tune in and
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out and chill and listen to a good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I must say, you have an incredible
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if anybody's told that
before, but you have a really good radio
[SPEAKER_00]: voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've heard that once or twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be very conscious of it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to another episode of Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's yeah, that's that's something that
honestly has only been with me for the
[SPEAKER_01]: last few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no surgery to open up a badly
deviated septum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I opened it up, my voice
plummeted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a nice thought effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into companion planting now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you break it down for the audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we've got a lot of beginners in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some intermediate and advanced
folks as well, but good amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might not even know what companion
planting is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is companion planting?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, I'm not sure if you know the
history behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I'm also consider myself a
beginner or maybe like intermediate or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love learning about companion planting,
but I'm by no means an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companion planting is actually something
that we use a fair bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see an indoor and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people might not even really know
they're using like cover crop would be one
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a prime example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But companion planting is planting
groupings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of plants together for mutual benefit,
whether they're helping each other through
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil, through the rhizosphere,
whether they're they're providing
[SPEAKER_01]: protection or pest control or or shelter
or whatever it may be, they're mutually
[SPEAKER_01]: benefiting from each other being there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of history, I think probably the
most well-known example would be the three
[SPEAKER_01]: sisters.
[SPEAKER_01]: So three sisters are corn, beans,
and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the corn grows super tall, but is a
really heavy nitrogen feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows really tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives a place for the beans to
actually travel up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll actually they're nitrogen
fixers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like legumes, right,
like beans and peas and other things,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're actually taking atmospheric
nitrogen and pulling it back down into
[SPEAKER_01]: their into their nodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's giving it a place for the corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a heavy feeder to feed off of the
squash are then planted around the base
[SPEAKER_01]: and the squash create this really nice
ground cover, which then, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeps in moisture, prevents a lot of soil
erosion and and obviously corn once again,
[SPEAKER_01]: a heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of feeding off of each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're providing the nitrogen,
providing the water retention,
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping that topsoil really happy and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in turn, they're all giving each other
what they need to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you had these this very successful
crop of corn, beans or peas and squash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's probably the most prime example.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's from that is like that's like
Native American agriculture for for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, millennia at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you got into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I was kind of hoping
that you would mention asking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: history there is the three sisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fascinating that that that's kind of
where it started, at least as far as we
[SPEAKER_00]: know, that started and how it's evolved
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many different benefits of
companion planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And could you get into the primary
benefits of companion planting for both
[SPEAKER_00]: not only just the plants themselves,
but the overall garden ecosystem soil as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, what are the downsides if there are
any?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with some of the downsides.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the the the pros are so many,
I think, in terms of the downsides,
[SPEAKER_01]: really, like most of the downsides would
be if you plant the wrong thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you plant the wrong pairings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then something is fighting for
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you plant all nightshades down here,
your tomatoes and things like that are all
[SPEAKER_01]: fighting from the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're planting something that's
invasive, it might be something you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to plant in your state or in your
province or in your country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you always want to check those things
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it might be something that you have a
hard time removing from the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mint would be a prime example.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love mint, but that can get out of
control really, really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't love mint and you don't
want to be constantly chopping it and
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping it and trying to maintain it and
contain it, it can get out of hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, like in terms of downsides,
those are like, you know, they're they're
[SPEAKER_01]: not exactly like the worst things ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but in terms of the benefits,
like there's so many to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you're saying, too, right,
it's it's for for all aspects of that that
[SPEAKER_01]: entire garden ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's there are some serious rabbit
holes to go down, especially when you
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting into like what's going on in
the rhizosphere in terms of like exudates
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like some of the main things,
obviously, like soil erosion, nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: cycling is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil hydraulics, the obviously nitrogen
fixation, is a big one and something that
[SPEAKER_01]: like a lot of us would probably be fairly
common with, especially with cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Control of like the moisture retention,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Weed suppression, pest control and
pollinators, pollinators, pollinators,
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in the right pollinators and
bringing in the right beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, yeah, there's so many things,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like that's what you're trying to do
is like you're just trying to cultivate
[SPEAKER_01]: this entire ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the woods, that's how it
works.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you go and look around you like
nobody's out there feeding nutrients to
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, nobody's out there top
dressing the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everybody's working together to break
down material, to cycle nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: to hold water, to provide cover,
to do all these things so that those
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems can thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what we're trying to do
is you're trying to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from canopy to rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was a good recap there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be so beneficial in so many
different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd like to narrow down on some of
those points.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you mentioned pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing we can get into next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, after that, we can touch upon like
weed suppression, pollination,
[SPEAKER_00]: which you touched upon, soil ecosystem,
beneficial insects and crop productivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with the pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us how does companion
planting contribute to natural pest
[SPEAKER_00]: control?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you give some specific examples?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll try to touch on like some of the
ones that like are a little more easily
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to a lot of us and some things
that we're pretty familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could probably grow it in whatever
zone you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of like they do it a couple
of different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have like scent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So through essential, you know,
essential oils, the release of certain
[SPEAKER_01]: smells that deter pests, bringing in
beneficial predators, trap cropping or
[SPEAKER_01]: even trap confusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of scents, marigolds,
basil, lemongrass, a lot of the herbs that
[SPEAKER_01]: you would use in culinary things or in
medicinal herbs and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of those are actually usually also
great at repelling pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like mint, rosemary, garlic,
basil, marigolds, all these things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can plant that you're either going to
you're going to probably consume them
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're also very good at deterring pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of them release their essential
oils like basil, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marigolds would probably be the one that a
lot of people would associate with
[SPEAKER_01]: companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that indoors and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the marigold itself does release an
essential oil, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A smell that'll deter things like aphids,
white flies and some others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also has a compound that it
releases into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A thiophene and that actually deters
predatory nematodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and they can, you know, there's other
things like marigolds can also be like a
[SPEAKER_01]: trap crop as well so that like it'll
attract other things to come eat it before
[SPEAKER_01]: they make it to your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of the major benefits for that,
yeah, like I'm saying, are just the
[SPEAKER_01]: deterrence of the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which is cool because like they all
have like multiple uses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could grow basil and rosemary and
thyme, lemongrass, all these things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can use in culinary, use in medicinal
herbs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also deter gnats, white flies,
aphids and other bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think another great example of that
would just for even in just your garden or
[SPEAKER_01]: just in your backyard alone, citronella
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we're all very,
we find very commonly in like Walmart or
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever you're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get like citronella candles and
citronella sprays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant the citronella plant around
the perimeter of your property and that
[SPEAKER_01]: deters things like mosquitoes and other
gnats, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, so in terms of scents,
you have a lot of different options there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also like trap cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my favorites probably,
if you've seen me grow indoors or
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors, nasturtiums.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love nasturtiums.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we plant nasturtiums around the outside
of like a stand up bed or around the
[SPEAKER_01]: perimeter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of plants, a lot of these like
pests and stuff, they'll go and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: probably consume the nasturtium first.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just kind of get lost in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go, they eat this first and they
don't make their way into your tomatoes or
[SPEAKER_01]: into your cabbages or whatever it is
they're making their way to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably one of my favorites
because you can eat the entire thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can eat the leaves, you can eat the
stems, you can eat the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus it's trapping other ones and they
kind of make a home there first before
[SPEAKER_01]: they ever make their way into your
precious crops, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So plus they're just, they're pretty and
they make a great ground cover,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a lot of extra like kind of
uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: That citronella tip you mentioned is gold
for a lot of people, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I used to live in Massachusetts and
mosquitoes were crazy and they had the
[SPEAKER_00]: citronella candles and sprays and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like planted around your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the perimeter of property and help
get rid of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how well that'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just depends on how big your
property is and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can imagine some of that stuff
working really, really good and marigolds.
[SPEAKER_00]: One you didn't name, which I'll throw out
there is peppermint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The peppermint is another one that kind of
falls in that category of pest control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that as IPM spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essential oil, mix it with water and
surfactant and spraying that on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, around the plants, the soil,
stuff like that once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, every other week, you know,
kind of rotating sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosemary you mentioned, and yeah,
so there are a ton of different things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that that are gonna help with pest
control and I'm glad you got into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and you'll find those in,
like you're saying, in a lot of your,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your organic sprays and stuff
are usually some form of like peppermint,
[SPEAKER_01]: oregano, rosemary, cloves, cinnamon,
any of those kind of like essential oils
[SPEAKER_01]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you find a lot of those in some of
your natural herbs and stuff that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have like multiple uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be ground covers, they could be
pest deterrents, or they can, you can pick
[SPEAKER_01]: them off and throw them in your,
throw them in the frying pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you get multiple uses out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into weed suppression next.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can companion planting suppress weeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of weed suppression,
simply they just out-compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So low lying ground covers can just
out-compete weeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like, like we're talking about like
cover crops and things like lentils are
[SPEAKER_01]: usually in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lentils are a very low lying kind of cover
they'll grow very quickly, they'll vine
[SPEAKER_01]: across and they usually choke any other
kind of weed trying to get through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with like the nasturtiums,
the squash and other things that can like
[SPEAKER_01]: create a really good ground cover and
create like a lot of shade there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're choking out those weeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really hard for weeds to get established
when that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also like, it's kind of leading
weeds into something else is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, they're choking out the weeds and
they're creating this really nice ground
[SPEAKER_01]: cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's also then creating a really
nice place for like beneficial mites and
[SPEAKER_01]: predators and other things to come in,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to talk about like one thing
without having to talk about all of it
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's so many like benefits,
but that's pretty well, when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: suppressing weeds, you're for the most
part, you're just choking them out very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a lot of options there,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do lentils and things that are
also helping with like nitrogen and stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can, if you wanna get like a
little prettier with it with ground
[SPEAKER_01]: covers, you can do like creeping thyme or
flocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Crimson clover is another one that we're
usually fairly familiar with and like
[SPEAKER_01]: lamb's ears, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create this really nice ground cover,
low lying, great then of course for like
[SPEAKER_01]: water retention and things like that,
but they're just out competing,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure those weeds just cannot get a
foothold in your garden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you mentioned a bunch of
examples there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have a buddy here in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very, very hot out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, right now it's a hundred
degrees out and it often reaches 110
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freedom units.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: 110 Fahrenheit to Canadian units.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta do the calculation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it is itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm from Labrador.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, so that's like, yeah,
mid forties, which is like, so I'm in New
[SPEAKER_01]: Jersey right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can barely handle it when it hits like
mid thirties, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Newfoundland and Labrador,
which is like one of the coldest
[SPEAKER_01]: provinces.
[SPEAKER_01]: A big change for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a massive change, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have a buddy that lives here who
uses melon as a cover, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the melon they grow so big,
the leaves are just so massive that it
[SPEAKER_00]: really covers almost his entire bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps with water retention really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause like it's so dry, so it dries out so
quickly, so easily here in such high temps
[SPEAKER_00]: that having that cover over it helps
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I call that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and that's, that's great
because that's like, look, we're talking a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit with the three sisters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The squash, the like squash, melons,
anything that's got those large leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: that are growing over the top,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they're, they're creating that really
nice like canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There where there's, they're holding in
that moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sun's not able to get down and
penetrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's keeping the soil from becoming like
hydrophobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I, and then of course,
if you start to compare it with like beans
[SPEAKER_01]: and peas and other things, now we're
pumping nitrogen and other things back
[SPEAKER_01]: down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see, I get like, this is one of those
topics where there's so many like benefits
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's hard to just like, it's hard to
just be like, yeah, let's just talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: this one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it's, it's, you're creating such an
amazing ecosystem that feeds the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: feeds the plants, feeds the air,
and they all protect each other and they
[SPEAKER_01]: work off each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just, yeah, it's something that
it's always been pretty exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got inspired from, uh, Niagara homegrown
CB tree and Nikita green thumb.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were accounts that were either doing
like big, beautiful gardens outdoors that
[SPEAKER_01]: were just like lush from one end of their
backyard to another, or in like Niagara
[SPEAKER_01]: homegrown's case, he had a hundred gallon
pot in his basement, uh, with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he would, you know, he would switch
out his electric lettuce throughout his
[SPEAKER_01]: time, but there was always like
nasturtiums and peppers and beans and peas
[SPEAKER_01]: and things hanging off the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what got me into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I, I can't help, but grow like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like first time I ever did it with a seven
gallon pots for seven gallon pots and a
[SPEAKER_01]: little two and a half square, uh,
um, tent indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew thyme, dill, chamomile,
nasturtiums, and a few others that was the
[SPEAKER_01]: easiest grow I have ever had.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use less nutrients, less water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The terpene production on everything was
through the roof and just the visuals and
[SPEAKER_01]: just opening it up, just opening up that
tent and that rich botanical smell would
[SPEAKER_01]: come through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody was happy, healthy, pest free.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the easiest grow I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I try to incorporate that now into
everything that I do, and it's pays off in
[SPEAKER_01]: droves for me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like companion planting is probably
one of the most underutilized processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: all the underutilized techniques in
gardening, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like more people should be doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see a whole lot of people doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine if I took a poll, actually,
I probably will do a poll and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: how many people do you companion plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, no type thing and see how many people
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be willing to bet there's gotta be
at least, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say 80 plus percent people don't do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've seen so many gardens where
people are, you know, they, they have this
[SPEAKER_01]: new backyard or there's new plot or
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just plant a few crops in there
and they kind of struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, like this one needs
shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one needs more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's a heavy feeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: This needs this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the biggest thing is like the
ground, like you haven't really done
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with the ground itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's compacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's doesn't have as much nitrogen
or, or anything that it needs just
[SPEAKER_01]: throwing over a cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is something you'll see in a lot of
like, uh, agricultural farm practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in like regenerative,
uh, beans or oats and, uh, oats and peas
[SPEAKER_01]: would be a prime example.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go in and flood an entire field that
needs to be turned over the next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll fill it with oats and peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oats grow tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peas grow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an amazing source of nitrogen and
proteins and amino acids and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that when crimped and decomposed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also, uh, creating a lot of
nitrogen down into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next year, when you come to plant
on that, you've got this, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: very rich compost over the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soil is very like open and very loamy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very happy and, uh, and it's full of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I think that's something that
like a lot of people are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, you could bring a lot of
life and vitality and soil fertility back
[SPEAKER_01]: by just like a few simple companions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're having a problem with pests,
throw some basil out there, throw some
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw some mint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do a few of those other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's, uh, hopefully we'll see
more people get into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think people quite understand some
of the real benefits of it as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, cause it's, it's a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're just throwing nasturtiums out
there and you think they look pretty,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're serving, you know,
like multiple purposes in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are many fruits, vegetables,
plenty of plants out there that need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinated or to produce a good example
would be peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now you can do it by hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peppers, melons, citrus trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: The list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does companion planting help with
pollination?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pollinators, pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all, we all love our pollinators,
uh, whether that's bees, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: bumblebees, honeybees, butterflies,
hummingbirds, moths, whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're, you're creating a home for them to
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we bring them in with things like,
uh, calendula, lavender, uh, nasturtiums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these, so many of these are
interchangeable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, um, creating a home for them to
come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're drawn and attracted to the,
you know, potential pollinate,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, flowers and things that are
in your garden, then you've got more
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators kicking around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to be able to pollinate your
cucumbers, your melons, your peppers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the other things that are honestly
so annoying to hand pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've ever hand pollinated cucumbers,
you will understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much you love pollinators to come in
and do that job for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but that's, I mean, that's really,
that's it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get more of an abundant crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, one of my favorites, kuka melons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever seen these
things, these little, these little,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like in between a cucumber and a
watermelon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only like this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're most adorable little things,
but they produce hundreds of little
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day when you go out,
they would be full of bees doing their
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, that's like, uh, that's like a
little garden snack.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could walk out, get a little,
get like a pocketful of those and walk
[SPEAKER_01]: around and check your crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but things like that, like bringing in
your nasturtiums, uh, your milkweed and
[SPEAKER_01]: all these flowers that like bring in
hummingbirds and pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just making sure that there's,
there's a little more, there's more bees,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's more hummingbirds and there's more
friends that go around and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you're actually, you know, you're actually
getting your crops to pollinate properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get your, you get way more of an
abundant crop and it's way easier that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the soil ecosystem?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can companion planting improve soil
health and fertility?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some effective plant
combinations for this purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like, this is like the rabbit
hole that you can go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like one of my favorite parts of
it at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, you know, we're preventing soil
erosion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're retaining water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, obviously you're fixing like
hydrophobic soil and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're feeding the rise of fear through
nitrogen fixation, uh, exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're producing a better nutrient cycle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, some great ones that were,
you know, we're very used to anything in
[SPEAKER_01]: like the legumes, uh, like green beans and
fava beans and peas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like white clover,
red clover, alfalfa, all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're bringing in atmospheric
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pulling it in from the atmosphere
and putting it down into their nodules,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's wonderful for, you know,
uh, anything that is, it's heavy feeder
[SPEAKER_01]: that needs a little extra nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which you can like, there's a lot of
like cool stuff you can do with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to just do like traditional
nitrogen fixing crops like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do like the shrubs and trees and
things like that, that you can do like
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like one of my favorites, sea buckthorn
berries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love sea buckthorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, you know, a super food kind of
thing, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a beautiful bush that can obviously
fixate, uh, nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I think that we're, a lot of
people are very common, I find very
[SPEAKER_01]: commonly is comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comfrey is a dynamic accumulator with a
really big tapery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it drives this really big tapery
way down and pulls all kinds of nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: up, making it a little easier for other,
uh, shallower roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be able to achieve some of those
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also makes a really good green
mulch because it pulls it into these giant
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You chop and drop those around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, now we're, we're laying out
this nice green mulch, which is better for
[SPEAKER_01]: soil erosion once again, water retention,
but you're feeding the rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding the fungal life and it can
reinvigorate your, your, your area pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like, um, obviously beans and
peas and things like that are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, barley and oats and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that can help with, uh,
like nitrogen lockout and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then of course, if you chop them,
they make a really good mulch cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you're all about like,
like soil is, is, that's where everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: going, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's, if it's hydrophobic and it's
sad and it has really shallow root zones,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you want deep root zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want, like, you want to keep that
moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to cycle those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's kind of where we start
getting into that, that, that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, uh, the wormhole, that, that rabbit
hole of exudates, because then we start
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at like, like basal exudates or,
uh, uh, your marigolds and other things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, that are not just like putting
nitrogen into the soil, but can be
[SPEAKER_01]: dropping like, uh, polysaccharides,
amino acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're signaling to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're releasing mucilages that
can, uh, retain more moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's so many benefits to being
able to have this diverse rhizosphere and
[SPEAKER_01]: this ecosystem in there that just feeds
the soil and keeps that, not only that top
[SPEAKER_01]: soil happy, but like deep down into the
soil, you're, you know, preventing the
[SPEAKER_01]: compaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're, you're bringing nitrogen and other
nutrients and stuff that we couldn't get.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing them up to the surface with
things like comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of those things where like,
there's so many benefits to the soil in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of like, how do we, how we can cycle
nutrients, water retention, or even
[SPEAKER_01]: produce our own compost and mulches that
can better feed that soil, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that, that top soil throughout the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, yeah, that's one of those ones
where like, I feel like you do a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: episode on just like exudates,
like those mucilage that's produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause they, they could signal to each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when, like if one plant is being
eaten up by whatever, it could say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm being eaten.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being attacked.
[SPEAKER_01]: They communicate through the root zones
and say, I need, I need more sugars to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to produce more terpenes or I need
more amino acids to be able to create
[SPEAKER_01]: more, whatever I need to be able to fend
off this pest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need more essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe then the basil releases more
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, there's just so much to
that, but yeah, it's, it's amazing what
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do with like barren soil with just
a little bit of like cover crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I say, bring in nitrogen,
bring in more nutrients and creating like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, you can, restore and balance
your soil pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly is incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned clover.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a white Dutch clover nitrogen fixer,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to grab the nitrogen from
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you mentioned, put it down in the
root zone and correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the, it'll hold that in the nodules
until the plant is actually killed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant actually needs to be killed
off and then it's kind of released.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if the microbes need to then
cycle those nutrients or what,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm told that's not really available.
[SPEAKER_00]: As if the clover is still alive and it's
still growing, the nitrogen actually isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: available until it's killed off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that true or false?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does depend on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's some clover, pull it into the
green leafs and it needs to be chopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like kind of like your barley or
oats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some clovers need to be chopped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others do pull it down into nodules,
but there's a bacteria that reacts with
[SPEAKER_01]: those nodules to release nitrogen,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several types of like,
nitrogen releasing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence not the expert talk right here,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria, nitrogen, roots, happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: From what I've been reading and I've been
doing a lot of stuff on like a lot,
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a lot of my info from like
sciencedirect.org and a few other places
[SPEAKER_01]: where you can kind of read the story of
studies on exudates and nitrogen fixation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like things like alfalfa, alfalfa is
probably the hot nitrogen fixer,
[SPEAKER_01]: but has to be chopped and dropped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beans and peas will pull it down into the
soil, but they're reacting with
[SPEAKER_01]: bacteriates in the soil that will actually
release nitrogen throughout their life
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle as well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hence why like the three sisters work so
well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Corn really needs that feed and the beans
and peas and things release that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: down in there through that bacterial
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of those things where like you
would want to look up like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to add more nitrogen to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to do chop and drop all the time
or can I add something that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly release and feed?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's beneficial to have it from all
aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why you'll see in like cover
crops, you'll have like lentils,
[SPEAKER_01]: fenugreek, barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: clover and a few others.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are good for, chopping and dropping
and releasing forms of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others are like you say, they're holding
it down in those nodules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are releasing it through bacteria and
others need to be killed off in the
[SPEAKER_01]: process, but they'll like clover will
almost like reseed itself as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really good at fixing nitrogen,
but then it just dies off and it'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: back in in the spring with new seeds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exudates episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you volunteering yourself for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that would be a pretty cool episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, that's something that like,
you know, we could get into cause it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pretty cool how you, like I say,
like, you know, that's the one thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of us think about is nitrogen,
but we're, we're also producing like,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the marigold, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, I was at thiophene, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This, this root exudate that tells
predatory nematodes to go away,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they also communicate with each other
and exchange carbon and exchange nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: and amino acids, polysaccharides,
there's mucilages that like protect
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's, it's huge, but it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's, I mean, that's where
we're getting all of our nutrients from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we're getting our strong
resilient plants from is biodiverse
[SPEAKER_01]: ecosystems that are communicating,
not just in the soil, but you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the canopy and wherever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a, that would be a big
episode for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we started getting into it,
I was like, man, I don't know where to
[SPEAKER_01]: like cut myself off with exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like nitrogen fixation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's one of the biggest things
that we would probably be most commonly,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, like aware of, cause a lot of people
use cover crops and that's, that's one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the major benefits of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to see an exudates episode,
let us know down in the comment section
[SPEAKER_00]: below, just leave it, leave it down there
in YouTube and we'll, uh, there's enough
[SPEAKER_00]: demand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, we'll get them back on here and
we'll, we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you discuss the role of companion
insects?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about companion planting and
attracting beneficial insects to the
[SPEAKER_00]: garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, uh, once again, one of the ones that
were, were most commonly, uh, used to
[SPEAKER_01]: would be ladybugs, uh, or green lace
wings, praying mantises, things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like ladybugs, uh, we can attract them
in with things like, uh, yarrow,
[SPEAKER_01]: calendula, milkweed, some of these other
flowers and things like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: They bring in your, your, you know,
your, your predators that are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, beneficial predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, the ladybugs, the green lace
wings, there are ones that you would see,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get attracted due to flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they come in, they hang out and they
make a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see you have aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to town on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then you've also have like,
let's say our, our, our cover crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: like the nasturtiums and other things that
are creating a really nice home just above
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's creating a nice place for like
beneficial mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rove beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just, really, you're just
creating a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making a home for things like
ladybugs, praying mantises, your green
[SPEAKER_01]: lace wings who come in and eat aphids and
eat, uh, whiteflies and mealybugs and
[SPEAKER_01]: other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just, it's just another part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, just, just make a home for
them, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll, they'll come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making a home for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll come in, they'll pollinate your
crops while they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing with your ladybugs and your
green lace wings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make a home to come in and they'll just,
eat all the bad insects while they're
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all bugs are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people I think jump to that
assumption that, ah, bugs and how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, well, hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ends up being a beneficial,
you know, it's like, what the heck?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's like the springtails are the
one of those, one of those ones that like
[SPEAKER_01]: people see and they pot and they panic
like, Oh my God, it's full of like little,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these little white things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean like they're down there,
you know, breaking down, breaking down,
[SPEAKER_01]: like decomposing matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, you know, come on in,
come hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as things are not like an
infestation, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: A balance it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously aphids, they don't get the
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to eat our crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of like, you know,
your row beetles, your springtails and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that, like they're in there to
balance things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're breaking down, decomposing matter,
which then can feed the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: the protozoa, the rotifers, everybody else
that's in there, the fungal life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once then that's right back into like
nutrient cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to break it down and feed it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's just, uh, as long as
there's balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you create a home for those pollinators
and for those beneficial bacteria and for
[SPEAKER_01]: those beneficial mites and predators and
everybody to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, like I say, it's like one of the
easiest grows you'll ever do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find balance where like you're able to
repel certain pests and bring them what
[SPEAKER_01]: you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just gotta go out and water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Balance is definitely key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you mentioned that because if you
have that imbalance, it could kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: throw things off, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an overpopulation of
something, well, that could take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a lot of people having issues with
roly polys and just take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harmful, ends up being a harmful
thing instead of a beneficial thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, roly polys can be your
friend, but have just too many of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like balance, you must find balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I mean, that, you know,
that goes further.
[SPEAKER_01]: The companion planting though,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, how do you water,
how do you keep things clean, humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: air?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, yeah, that's a whole thing on
itself, but that's achieving balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like once it's, once you find balance,
some of these grows are so easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing a lot of my companion
planting and stuff indoors and like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so easy to keep those pots moist,
but without having them soaked and
[SPEAKER_01]: waterlogged.
[SPEAKER_01]: The surface tension, like you almost never
get hydrophobic soil, your, your leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: sets, everybody's happy and fed and
healthy the entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that I put in there,
the electric lettuce would be like praying
[SPEAKER_01]: the entire time.
[SPEAKER_01]: No top dresses, just water and good
quality soil to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's, it makes it so easy and
just so like the basil is, is more
[SPEAKER_01]: fragrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: The peppers you grow are spicier and have
more flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tomatoes, everything has, everything
just seems so much happier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And healthier pulse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing it at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's a huge thing right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned earlier in the episode that
you had amazing terpene profile when you
[SPEAKER_00]: do companion planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does companion planting actually
enhance the flavor growth yield of certain
[SPEAKER_00]: crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some examples of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's, that's another one where
there's, there's so many examples,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the same as like, you know,
the three sisters, obviously, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A corn is a heavy feeder, so that's
feeding off of the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're being able to produce a heavier
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of like, like at home,
like indoor growing, whatever it may be,
[SPEAKER_01]: things like, like basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basil is one that they're talking a lot
about, like exudates in there are
[SPEAKER_01]: producing a lot of like sugars,
polystacharides, and possibly like other
[SPEAKER_01]: amino acids and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that the plant that it's in the same
pot with, can have an easier time uptaking
[SPEAKER_01]: those when it needs to fight off stress,
drought, or if it's in the middle of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, making glandular trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can produce more essential oils
easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, it's got everything it needs in
there to make more complex profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can, you know, a lot of what I'm
saying, maybe anecdotal from me,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go read this, you can go read the
papers that tell you like, what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate actual actions that go in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: But every pepper I've grown at home,
it doesn't even matter if it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a jalapeno.
[SPEAKER_01]: A jalapeno will hit you like a reaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's so much stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, the healing herb,
the electric lettuce, is happier and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthier, prays the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reeks, it's very complex terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so much easier to produce these
really complex smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even our companion plants,
so like the basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, the basil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you open up that tent, the smells
that come through there, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all, they're all doing that
through those actions down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're keeping that root zone happy
and healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're feeding, of course, the bacteria,
the protozoa, everybody that's down in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, they're feeding it through the root
zone, through these exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're also communicating with each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we start to, you know,
we start to get heavy in the flower or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or in the drought or whatever it may be,
a little extra heat stress, they say,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, I need a little more, whatever amino
acid, I need a little more sugar,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need a little more carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you feed the roots?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get these just lush, happy,
healthy, tasty crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's, you'll see the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You plant, you find the right pairings,
you'll, you'll see the difference,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about pairing, can you provide
some examples of kind of classic companion
[SPEAKER_00]: plant pairs and explain why they work well
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so like basil, tomatoes are probably
a pretty good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see a fair amount of basil repels,
like white flies that would eat the
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and aphids as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the tomatoes provide shelter for the
basil and the basil in turn produces more
[SPEAKER_01]: exudates to feed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: More sugars and things that it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carrots and onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: These actually, carrots and onions are
actually a pretty cool one because the
[SPEAKER_01]: carrots repel onion flies and onions repel
carrot flies.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you pair those, of course,
then with other things that are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to feed the soil, like,
you know, back into like your lentils and
[SPEAKER_01]: your peas and beans and stuff,
you're keeping that the soil quite healthy
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're usually like peas,
onions and carrots are usually planted
[SPEAKER_01]: very far apart from everybody else.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of like waste space kind of
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I don't know, in terms of like,
you know, maybe cabbage and dill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cabbage dill is another like really good
one where the dill bring in like lace
[SPEAKER_01]: wings and they'll, and ladybugs and
they'll eat some of the like cabbage
[SPEAKER_01]: eating worms and pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's the biggest thing is,
in terms of like pairings is what are you,
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you want to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the crop that you are going to
eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look up the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be like, these are the ones I like
and I really have a hard time growing
[SPEAKER_01]: them, but they're always getting chewed
up, whatever it is happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, I want to grow carrots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I'll pair them with onions this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love tomatoes, but I always struggle
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then I'll feed my tomatoes,
basil and like peas and beans or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that to be able to help feed the soil
and especially those heavy feeders like
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes and corns and melons and beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the biggest thing is just look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are the things that you,
you know, you want to grow and you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a successful crop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a pairing for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a pairing that will probably
not help it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the biggest thing is just
look it up and be like, I want a big
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy crop of this this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What goes well with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple listed here that I think
I'd mention, although I don't know why
[SPEAKER_00]: they're good pairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can answer that for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll list them with tomatoes, lettuce with
beans and cucumbers and basil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard about any of those pairs
before?
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly haven't even heard about those
pairings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, one thing I have noticed is a lot of
the pairings of like why one doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: or why one does, a lot of it's anecdotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like old farmer talk kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it dill?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dill and tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that like early dill feeds the
tomatoes, but then when it grows up tall,
[SPEAKER_01]: it stunts the tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody says why it stunts the
tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't say if it's stealing nutrients
or what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of like, there's a lot of
anecdotal evidence of like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just, we just don't put those together
because they just don't do well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm cool with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got a lot of, you got a lot
of experience with it and it doesn't work
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take your face value for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's, yeah, a lot of it,
you might want to just, that's why I say
[SPEAKER_01]: like do some research, look it up,
kind of, you know, maybe, maybe it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's an old wives tale or whatever
it is, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that's, it's, you know,
it's 2024, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like get on Google, look it up,
see what grows well in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of crops do you want to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would pair well with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to go like, you want to
get crazy with it, like how you restore
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil and how we feed the soil and
what is, whatever else we're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can go to like, like I say,
science direct, I think it's dot org or
[SPEAKER_01]: dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look up all kinds of studies
of like, what is, what is the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, alfalfa is a cover crop,
fenugreek is a cover crop, barley,
[SPEAKER_01]: nasturtiums, exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can, you can break it down into,
you know, what are the absolute best
[SPEAKER_01]: pairings or what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that's, that's, that's what I
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you probably do have to be
careful because I imagine that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of misinformation out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you happen to know any specific
resources, any like websites that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: think of that are credible that you would
recommend to beginners interested in
[SPEAKER_00]: learning more about the companion
planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, sorry, sorry to not be able to
help you, but the way it works for me is
[SPEAKER_01]: like how I do things is I'll take like a
huge pile of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll read every website I could possibly
read.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll find every study I can find,
and then I'll just cross reference
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's, and I just, I just kind of
lose myself down like a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: down a rabbit hole and I come out the
other side, like exudates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so yeah, you know, it's the biggest
thing is just, you know, uh, just read a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot, watch a lot, try to, you know,
try to decipher in between what's hooey
[SPEAKER_01]: and what's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and just plant things and see if they
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they don't, don't plant it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did want to ask you about your thoughts
on the 12 seed cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other types of packs of cover
crops, which one of the most common is
[SPEAKER_00]: like a 12 seed blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a soil sells it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on Amazon.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can certainly be used as companion
planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend those or would you say go
individual planting of plants instead?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I like a grouping of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, so the cover crops are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: They only serve so much purpose,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so like there, there's a lot of like
low lying cover crops in there that are
[SPEAKER_01]: great for choking at weeds and good for
weed suppression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course that water retention and
things like we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of nitrogen fixtures and
stuff in there, but there's no,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, there's no, like, uh, there's no
basals and there's no marigolds and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's no trap crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's, there's things that are
missing from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the cover crops, which it's funny
you say 12 because it went like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like five a couple of years
ago and then it was seven and now it's 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know where it's going to go
from there, but I love seeing it get
[SPEAKER_01]: tailored more and more as time goes by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but they can only go so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fantastic for revitalizing that
top soil, establishing your soil very
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly, establishing a good rhizosphere
and things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But of course there's some, there's some
missing things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I love cover crop, go out there,
fill in as much space as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, you still want to
incorporate your things like your basals
[SPEAKER_01]: and your yarrow and your marigolds and
lemongrass and other things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still, still need to find a home for
those, especially in terms of like
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like them, but yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get the fives or the sevens or the
twelves and still be, still be very happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring up a really great point though
that there are things missing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think some people grab those blends,
the 12 seed blend, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that they're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got everything they need as far,
but now you can certainly add more things
[SPEAKER_00]: on other companion plants to the mix and
have more benefits on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for indoor growers, those cover
crops make a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, like you can, you can do
your basals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I do a little bit of everything,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done like corn indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've, I constantly have like basil and
sunflowers and comfries and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of like, if you're starting
like living soil pots indoors and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to establish that pot really quickly,
you want to have a more evenly dispersed
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to, that nitrogen fixation,
especially if we're indoor growing or
[SPEAKER_01]: growing the electric lettuce, it's
usually, or you know, loves its nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: loves those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those cover crops, they're great for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we start to go outdoors and now we're
dealing with more pests and we need more
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinators and we don't want to be out
there every day hand pollinating things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we started incorporating some
more of those companion plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those, those basals, those marigolds,
those flowers, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, uh, those cover crops still serve
a purpose out there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like companion planting,
it doesn't just feed the soil and feed
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also maximizing our spacing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you can do, you can do cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also do like intercropping where
you're growing certain crops together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which they compare, you compare with
companion planting, but we're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: just maximize that space, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I personally, I got away from
monocropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always found it so weird that I would
like have all this expensive, beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and these big pots downstairs and
stuff, but I was just growing like one
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it was done, it was just
like, maybe add a little cover crop and
[SPEAKER_01]: then back to this one more crop again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to be able to like, you know,
I harvest one and then there's another
[SPEAKER_01]: coming behind it where they're all feeding
each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the same time, I'm harvesting like
things for my culinary adventures in the
[SPEAKER_01]: kitchen or herbal medications for
topicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're feeding the soil, whatever it may
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that to like, I want to maximize
every square inch of that soil that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have, whether it's indoor or.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a great way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're just scratching the
surface on this talk here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it would go so much deeper in
so many different avenues within this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're going to wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, you can find me Instagram or
YouTube, Nattie's Nottie nursery,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, K N O T T Y.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and right now we're on a little break
from cooked and caffeinated, but we'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the fall and the winter with a
whole round of new guests over on FCP 11
[SPEAKER_01]: AM Eastern Sundays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I, you know, thank you so
much for having me on here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'm a little like a little rambly
and like trying to like, trying to like
[SPEAKER_01]: pick the best things from this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause this is such a broad topic,
but I feel like it's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully people can now see is a little
more approachable and you can start to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand why you have cover crops,
why we want a companion plant and how we
[SPEAKER_01]: can get a little bit more out of our,
our indoor and outdoor gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really appreciate you having me on
here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely learned quite a bit here and
I feeling my audience did as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do a really great job of breaking
things down in a manner that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people can understand is what I'll say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a simple man and I like to keep
it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're, I think you truly
understand something when you can speak it
[SPEAKER_01]: in layman terms and I'm pretty good at
breaking it down.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, we'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nattie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll see you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
