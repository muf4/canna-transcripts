[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk Podcast, this episode
number 118.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Big Daddy
Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is a content creator with over 100
videos and 6,000 subscribers on his
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube channel called The Grow Under the
Stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this episode is a little bit different
than any of the other episodes on this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking gardening content creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although this episode isn't focused on
growing plants, I still thought it'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable to hear how gardening content is
created, gardening channels he watches,
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening channels he recommends other
people to watch, where gardening content
[SPEAKER_00]: will be five years from now, and so much
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to see highlights of these
podcast episodes, search Garden Talk Clips
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a channel dedicated to short,
bite-sized clips of these episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a gardening channel where I
have over 130 videos showing the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have that channel linked down in the
description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my goals for this podcast is to
bring free information about gardening to
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.

that it saves me money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole bunch of different inputs in
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I no longer have to go out there and
buy a silica bottle, then a separate
[SPEAKER_00]: seaweed bottle, beneficial bacteria,
then a separate one for mycorrhizal fungi.

resistance to pests and diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: IR light is said to stimulate stem growth
and flowering, as well as induce plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: enter their sleep stage quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Deep Red light is said to promote
flowering and fruit development.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Big Daddy Buds
from the Grow Under the Stairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we hop right into an introduction,
tell us about you, a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my name is Big Daddy Buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I got the channel called the
Grow Under the Stairs, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a content creator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been doing this for about 18 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started on YouTube right along when
YouTube started, when there weren't that
[SPEAKER_01]: many people doing it yet, when it was kind
of weird to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've made a living off of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm trying to do it over here in
this side of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: This episode is going to be a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we were first talking about
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually what we do is we talk about
garden, fundamental things that you can do
[SPEAKER_00]: in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the folks that are hearing this can
potentially take some of those practices
[SPEAKER_00]: and implement their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about how you potentially
wanted to get into content creation,
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about content creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at first I was like, I don't know if
this is really going to fly, but I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about it for a little while longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, it's gardening content
creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It totally relates to everything this
podcast is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're in the gardening niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can totally get into that in this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think people will
definitely gain some value out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you wanted something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, glad to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know what it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I figured I've seen so much on your
channel and so many people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: educated already that have PhDs that do
this for a living and have so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different angles to come at when we're
talking about this plant that I just felt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let me bring something different
to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have experienced is my PhD is in
content creation and it has to do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and it still has to do with how we
distribute information about the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that we love.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, you know, let's bring that
to your channel and hopefully give the
[SPEAKER_01]: people a different viewpoint of what it is
that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to open up some
eyes too, because there's some things
[SPEAKER_00]: behind the scenes as content creators that
we do that like the viewers don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: realize like how much work gets put into
it, how we are so suppressed and so on and
[SPEAKER_00]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get into all of that
today, which is really going to be a fun
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how did you, how did it all start for
you?
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you get into content creation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess something that content creators
all have in common is the need to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to want to be liked and accepted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like I had some of that growing
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have led a kind of very interesting
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done a lot of things that I think are
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've always wanted to share that with
other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I was younger, I used to travel a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was what my first channel was about,
was about traveling and showing all these
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences that I would have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to send all these videos to my
friends, you know, like bother them,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, look what just happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at who I just met.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in this hotel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would get tired of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't really want to be bothered like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's into that type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started uploading the content to
YouTube and people started following.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found an audience and since then I've
been hooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said, I mean, before we even hopped on
here and started recording, you had
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned 2006 is your first YouTube
video, which is a very long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty impressive there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to look back on mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2007 was the first one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I uploaded 10 videos in 2007.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely not gardening videos,
you know, completely unrelated,
[SPEAKER_00]: related to me just doing crap with my
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's wild to see like how far it's
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to get back at all the work that
was put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy because back then it wasn't
cool to be a YouTuber at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually kind of weird,
you know, and there was a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of people that would even put
themselves out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, once you put yourself on on
screen, it's like it's there forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So back then, even 10,000 views felt like
a lot because no one else was doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I remember those times were so weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be on TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now look how things have changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of me wanting to be on TV,
it seems like TV people want to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like movie stars that have their own
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this wasn't like this before.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be kind of weak even for like a
famous person to have a YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_01]: back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way that things have shifted,
it has been amazing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been crazy to have kind of like
an open source to where anybody can go in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and upload videos and make it in
back at scene and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus, you know, back before YouTube,
you had to be kind of an actor or some
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of celebrity to get on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's kind of opened up the
floodgates there for anybody to really
[SPEAKER_00]: have an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for your particular channel,
The Grow Under The Stairs, can you talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: us about that channel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what it's about?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it got started, your style of content
over there, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the reason I started growing at
home, the medicinal plant that we all
[SPEAKER_01]: love, was out of fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found myself one time, we all have these
stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found myself in New York needing to buy
something because all of my usual people
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was one of those sketchy situations
where you're in one of these dark rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: with some people that you don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all looking at you funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're weapons on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's that type of deal and you're not
part of that world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want a little something to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had that situation happen to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got scared straight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came back home and I said, listen,
I'm gonna have to start growing because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not worth it doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was back when it was super illegal
and I had to go into New York to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm gonna take a risk, let me take a
risk and start growing at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, I'm a content creator by
trade.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just became part of what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, let me start a channel then and
let me showcase what I'm doing and teach
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time as I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a comedian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be my angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I could offer different to
this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, let me make it entertaining so
that while you're learning, you're also
[SPEAKER_01]: laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a nice niche that
within the niche that I'm carving out for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody else is really doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have that unique style of both
education and entertainment humor that not
[SPEAKER_00]: many people are doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I like about your content is
that you're showing the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in your garden, you're giving them
valuable information, but you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: showing a little bit about your personal
life as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing your cats, you're showing
you going out to dinner, you're showing
[SPEAKER_00]: this massive snowman that you saw down the
street that broke a record, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Anchorage, Alaska, which you live now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing all of that together,
it's different than everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you have some really good
content and you also grow some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: looking plants, you grow some fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing I was thinking about
before we, as we were planning this is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, okay, if we start talking about
content creation, some people are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: want to actually know how you grow your
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, oh man, I want to know how to grow
his plants like him.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe we'll do something like that in
the future to where we do talk about,
[SPEAKER_00]: break down your style of growing and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do have a feeling that some
people are going to be like, what the
[SPEAKER_00]: heck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how he grows fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the videos themselves are about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do weekly videos that display weekly
what the plants are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like a lot of people have
strayed away from that kind of content
[SPEAKER_01]: because YouTube restricts what they show
and who they push if you're showing
[SPEAKER_01]: certain things and saying certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's still important to look
at these plants as they develop and tackle
[SPEAKER_01]: these problems that arise on a week to
week basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the whole from seed to harvest
videos, but I feel like there's a lot that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets missed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to throw in that you
sprayed iron for an iron deficiency for
[SPEAKER_01]: one day and it fixed it in a video that's
an hour long from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to forget in a weekly
video.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I feel like I'm going to continue doing
this and hopefully people would just learn
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a little bit of patience and come
and just look at the plants and plant and
[SPEAKER_01]: learn from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's like little by little,
you know, that's how they grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes patience.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I'm offering too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody could go to your channel,
which also I have linked down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're on one of the audio
platforms, just search for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow under the stairs search for it on
YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pop right up and you could see his
grow and he has weekly content.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you definitely learn from him
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to touch about the other, the other
thing when you spoke about sharing my
[SPEAKER_01]: personal life and the videos and
everything like that, it's kind of crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if it's the same for you
since we've been doing this for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I started the videos that I was
doing were about travel, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: about my traveling and my experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I switched to comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I started doing the comedy.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, I switched to cooking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing cooking and now I'm here in
this gardening space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the stuff that I learned
before, I'm able to apply it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am using comedy still.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just mixing everything together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it the same for you or you get to,
it's almost like you're acquiring skills
[SPEAKER_01]: in every step of the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you end up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just know how to do so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, kind of like I started out doing
just dumb videos, my friends uploading
[SPEAKER_00]: those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I actually did, I was recording
prank videos on the strip here in Las
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas, going that film and hidden camera
prank videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, I guess some of the stuff,
I think some of like more like the behind
[SPEAKER_00]: the scenes YouTube stuff, like the titles,
descriptions, tags, all that stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gets you farther of a reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff can be applied to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I totally get what you mean by
what you've learned before definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: comes over to this same niche because
you're still making videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally get what you mean by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're wearing a mask right now and you
wear a mask in all your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: What made you wear a mask?
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to hide your identity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing things illegal over there or
what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And will your face ever be revealed or is
this always going to be like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not a crook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, there's two reasons for
the mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one being, you know,
when I started this, it was super illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: where I was at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to get in trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I kept doing the videos, the laws
started to change in my favor.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there was the second thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that I've actually found
success before in content creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't want to mix the audience that
I've already created on another space with
[SPEAKER_01]: this audience, because I already know that
that audience is not all there when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to the medicinal plant that,
you know, I like to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully, as things keep changing,
people will be a little bit more accepting
[SPEAKER_01]: and then I'll be able to take off the
mask.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is something that I'm really close
to wanting to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I guess it's in my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be able to share with the public
and you know, intermingle with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's kind of fun when you're
in an event and somebody says,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you know, I saw your video and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I missed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully I'll be able to be fresh
faced with you all soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool to see a face reveal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get what you mean by, you know,
you can be recognized by people that were
[SPEAKER_00]: watching your old videos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some might not like that regarding the
niche that we're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I actually can totally relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to hide my face when I first started
making grow videos because I had an
[SPEAKER_00]: employer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a manager at amazon.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I was afraid that my
associates were going to be recognizing me
[SPEAKER_00]: and they'd be like, oh, you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so hiding identities,
I can relate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first started watching,
trying to learn to grow, I was actually
[SPEAKER_01]: watching you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was watching, I was watching a
pigeon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you know, and that was before he
showed his face.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the OG pigeons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the pigeon that I, you know,
that I was that I could relate to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's crazy because the reason I was
able to figure like the mask out is
[SPEAKER_01]: because I'm like, hey, if he could do it
without a face, everything else I had been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing before had been with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anyone do it like that,
you know, like without a face.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, if he could do it,
if they could do it, then I can just,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I can do it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually that gave me the courage to
start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually the question I was going
to ask you is where do you get your
[SPEAKER_00]: inspiration from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it, it seems like part of it was
pigeons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there anybody else that kind of
inspired you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Mr. Canucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I definitely, uh,
watch a lot of his videos and the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that it seems like he put so much work
into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's people that really do,
like they, they go to work on their
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me that's inspiring because it
makes me be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't, I don't have a problem
watching a hi again video or Mr. Canucks
[SPEAKER_01]: video and seeing, uh, that their images
look so Chris, you know, and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to adjust my settings so that
my stuff looks that Chris, I love to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: from everybody that I'm watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So inspiration, that's why I want people
to, to continue showing their plans in
[SPEAKER_01]: their videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to invite more creators that are
doing this at home to come to this space
[SPEAKER_01]: and normalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only for the sake of the plan itself,
but for the sake of people like me that
[SPEAKER_01]: want to learn, you know, whether it be,
uh, uh, how to get better shots of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you know, how to get those,
those really close tricone shots that you
[SPEAKER_01]: see on Instagram, you know, like all of
these things to me are important,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, or interesting to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want, and I keep learning it from
the people that I keep watching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the more people we have in this space,
the more talent, the better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Better that we're going to continue to be,
you know, as far as the video quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, that's important as a content
creator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I totally get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are thousands of content creators in
this niche now making gardening videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who do you watch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you mentioned Pigeon, you
mentioned hi again, you mentioned Mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else do you watch?
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch a bunch of people from small
creators to, to the big names.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I made a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want to forget nobody,
but, uh, how we grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched tobacco university, Rosie Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like I said, Mr. Canucks, Mr. Uh,
homegrown TV, build the soil, bill ward,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make content, uh, about the plant,
I'm probably trying to learn from you some
[SPEAKER_01]: way or another, like either by watching
your videos, as far as quality and how you
[SPEAKER_01]: do your thing or watching how you grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those content creators,
or you can expand it to even beyond that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ones do you kind of recommend to
people?
[SPEAKER_00]: If somebody were to ask you, Hey,
where can I find good content besides your
[SPEAKER_00]: channel?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who would you say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, definitely you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys should check out Mr. Grow,
you know, check out your grow series and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, you know, I, I like, I like Mr.
Canucks, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's a, uh, a person that
everybody could appreciate or in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like you could appreciate the
art.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also grows a lot of fire and he's not
as abrasive as me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm in your face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm her, you know, he's not, he's more
like laid back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you, which is a better entry point
for more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, uh, if I were to recommend
somebody, I would do either you or Mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about, uh, Dakota from home grow TV
ever, uh, you ever tuned into any of his
[SPEAKER_00]: videos?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's another, that's another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Homegrown TV.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was, I was telling him the
other day, like, like, I can't believe the
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of work that you put in your
videos, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's another level of, of work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and I haven't met him in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know his personality is the same
as in the videos, but when I, when I watch
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, it makes me want to grab
the dude and, and, and ask him a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of questions related to how his day
goes and how he plans these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he's really, really, uh,
he, you know, his work speaks for itself
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely also show that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love watching his, uh, his work as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basement grow show is another one that,
that's, uh, really, really funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's the funniest dude on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I, I, I, sometimes I'm like,
man, I need to do this kind of content
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is very fun, short to the point kind
of jokes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so I would recommend for jokes,
man, basement grow show on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's, that's right at the top of
the list for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower Joe's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met him in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Dakota in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the nicest person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those guys are extremely nice,
but Dakota is just, he's just so humble
[SPEAKER_00]: and like, he's just so appreciative,
you know, and I give him feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey dude, your viewers are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anybody hasn't tuned into home grow TV
on YouTube, search for it and check out
[SPEAKER_00]: his videos because that's like the number
one guy right now who's really pushing it
[SPEAKER_00]: to the next level when it comes to video
production, storytelling, educating the
[SPEAKER_00]: viewer, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't speak highly enough about him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a great, great dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one I would personally recommend
is build a soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned him, but as far as
organic gardening, definitely the
[SPEAKER_00]: education is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to learn how to grow
organically, build a soil by far is
[SPEAKER_00]: probably one of the best, if not the best
channels out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a, you know, like I like to
categorize some of these into different
[SPEAKER_01]: categories, you know, into different
places.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like some of these, I only watch for
entertainment purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Build a soil is one where you're going to
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, to be honest, I don't know
if that would be the first place I would
[SPEAKER_01]: send you if you don't know what you're
doing at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I feel like he speaks about a
lot of advanced stuff and a lot of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that people, you know, I feel like you got
to have your foot in already maybe to
[SPEAKER_01]: check out build a soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are things that bare bones beginner
walks in there and then starts listening
[SPEAKER_00]: to him talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my goal was head left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sticking on my bottles, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different categories,
you know, that's a humor, there's
[SPEAKER_00]: education, things that's just
entertainment, there's talking head
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, there's people that show plants,
people that don't show plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've actually been pretty vocal.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has some concerns about the current
state of content creation, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: people showing plants, people not showing
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you kind of expand on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, YouTube is kind of not
clear on as far as like the rules when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to what we're doing because it says
that we're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that we're okay to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It says that we're okay to show certain
things, you know, but then it doesn't act
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my problem is when us as creators stop
showing the plant, we're also saying it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I feel like we're agreeing by
doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my opinion, I feel like if it is
okay, then let's treat it like it's okay
[SPEAKER_01]: and let's show it like it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about it like it's okay,
instead of doing the opposite,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, and it's not as interesting for me
to hear people just talk about something
[SPEAKER_01]: that I love to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason I wake up every day is
to see the changes in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives me energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to record the videos because that
same excitement that I feel, I'm able to
[SPEAKER_01]: capture it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's easy to go there and like,
oh my God, look at this plant and then
[SPEAKER_01]: just put a camera in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That did itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and when you sit, when you take
that, the aspect of the plant away,
[SPEAKER_01]: for me, it takes some of that excitement
away as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a fan, I would love to continue
seeing plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a person that's a proponent of the
plant, I would love for people to make it
[SPEAKER_01]: more, to normalize it and act like if it's
okay, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And YouTube has changed so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, back in, you could monetize the
content, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can monetize and actually get paid for
your work.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't think that,
oh, you're just uploading YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should you get paid for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's videography.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're filming, you're editing,
you're putting in hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're saying that, oh,
people making TV shows, they shouldn't get
[SPEAKER_00]: paid, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, forget the people who film there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget the people who do the editing,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them should get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just making videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you could say that about anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, Uber drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just driving people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should they get paid?
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get when people all, you're just
making YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You shouldn't really get paid for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry about getting paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, I don't know, I'm kind of
against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, I have a clean channel and a
dirty channel now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a dirty channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I show my plants because YouTube is
very restrictive now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be 18 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They suppress your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't monetize it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't get paid at all, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time, energy I'm spending on
creating those videos, I get nothing in
[SPEAKER_00]: return for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, now luckily I have sponsors who
help with funding my content creation,
[SPEAKER_00]: affiliates, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of helping me keep afloat,
but I want to get paid for my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so kind of having a clean channel
where I abide by YouTube's guidelines and
[SPEAKER_00]: still be able to reach an audience and
still be able to relay things,
[SPEAKER_00]: tiptoeing around their guidelines in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to kind of reach more of an
audience and not be suppressed for once
[SPEAKER_00]: and be compensated for my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I could kind of see it both ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see why people stopped showing
plants, you know, and it makes you put all
[SPEAKER_00]: this energy into it and you get nothing
out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well I'll just sit back and make
talking head videos and then I will get
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I understand why everything
shifted the way it did, but I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I really feel like it would be nice
if people still made videos about plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and just, yeah, I enjoy that content as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, even under the power that I
did, I mentioned specifically that the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that you did it is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a different channel that you show
your stuff and I can't tell people how to
[SPEAKER_01]: run their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, at the end of the day,
this is just my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm coming at it from a fan's
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put on my YouTube and I want to
see the plant, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what it comes down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to push for that just for my
own personal gains, you know, but I also
[SPEAKER_01]: think it is important to normalize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't want to, I don't want to
hide it if it's not something that needs
[SPEAKER_01]: to be hidden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's not how you feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, like I'm gonna even take it
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we, we come from the era of
where it was really illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like it, people really went to
jail for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were, the only reason we even at
the point where we could do these videos
[SPEAKER_01]: is because there are people that gave
their freedom for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that, you know,
stood outside and said, I'm going to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to smoke this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in this outside, even if I'm
getting arrested or whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: consequences are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now it's like, I'm going to lose my
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's okay, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm going to take that out if that's
what it comes with.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I have a mask on,
so I don't want to pretend that I'm holy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still not risking anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, uh, I feel like my channel could
be the sacrificial lamb if, if,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it needs to be in my case, because I
saw so many other people risk so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to keep fighting the fight,
you know, but yeah, it is tough that
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube is really suppressing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I actually had another content
creator hit me up this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, dude, I received a strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, what do you, what do you
think you received a strike for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, I think it's because I,
I promoted Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, thinking in my head,
why Grove bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he sent me a clip of his video and
he's promoting Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has the, the, the website for Grove
bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got his discount code and he's
showing the Grove bags empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he's showing them with buds in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So YouTube probably thinks that,
Hey, you want to buy these bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strike.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they think that, Hey, he's directing
them to where they can purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where YouTube has a huge no,
no, you can't link to any way we can
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also with the seeds as well,
you can't link to anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can purchase those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people shy away from even
talking about it because I, I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get strikes for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: YouTube's so unclear and you kind of
touched upon this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like, we're walking on a
tight rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know which way to go in a sense,
how to kind of balance things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so, so because of these things,
like, like, look at that right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He says he thinks he thinks is because of
the Grove bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not even that clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, I also understand
when, when people do choose to just do
[SPEAKER_01]: talking head videos and, and, you know,
find different ways around it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because like you said, you know,
these, these videos take, take a long time
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do put a lot of work into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, man, like these videos
stay on our minds the whole time we're
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it might look like I'm only
editing for, for two hours today,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm thinking of the storyline the
whole day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's burning me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's burning me down the ashes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand when people change the way
they do things because they need to get
[SPEAKER_01]: paid and need to make a living off of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no knock to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just, again, as a fan and somebody
that enjoys the plant, that's why I wake
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to show it, baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: This next question, it kind of relates to
what we were just talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think is like, you know, the fact that
lots of YouTube content creators that are
[SPEAKER_00]: filming their plants, they start a
channel, then they disappear within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first year or two, because either the
video gets an attraction, YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: suppresses them, they get strikes,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What keeps you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I'm a fan of the videos
themselves at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know, I know, I don't know if I'm
gonna explain it as well, but I know I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit there, I edit, I record,
I'm thinking, I'm burning my brain,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once the video is done and it's on the
TV and I'm playing it on YouTube or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, I'm a fan of that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I am, if I become a different person,
it becomes magic to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how I made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was there the whole time, but I don't
know how that came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm watching makes sense in its own,
apart from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is a, that's like a high that I
need in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to get that video.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need it for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I enjoy what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the second thing is the response from
the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to see, you know, as a YouTube,
you can go to YouTube and check your
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact that I made a video that's
12 minutes long and I got 70% retention,
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% of people that started watching that
video and that that video to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, ah, it feels like this to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, you guys like what I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: You laughed probably like I laughed when I
watched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My jokes hit, you know, you enjoyed the
plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like this is my video right
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what keeps me going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the actual creation process certainly
gets you fired up.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, you put so much into your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell just by watching it and me
being a content creator, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I'm watching your videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, man, this is my, this must taken
him 10 plus hours per video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the amount of, uh, effects,
transitions, overlays, uh, you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: skits in there, all that stuff,
the filming part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long does it take you to film a video,
edit a video?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's that process look like for
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like the whole week, you know,
it feels like a work in week, even though
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not 40 hours because it's in my head
the whole week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels, you know, it feels like the
whole week, but I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: The narration part of it, which is the
last thing I do, uh, to record a 12
[SPEAKER_01]: minute, it takes me about one hour to
record two to three minutes of audio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that's just what it works out to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, so that, that, that'll give you
like an idea of how much effort goes into.
[SPEAKER_01]: Into one of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sitting there for hours,
hours, trying to just come up with silly
[SPEAKER_01]: things, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and the rest of the video is sort
of as, as it happens, I record things as
[SPEAKER_01]: they happen, as I need to do them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this week I need to water change the
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I record when that is going on,
you know, I don't, I don't try to make
[SPEAKER_01]: anything happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't try to change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like, I want to take note of
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there specific topics that you feel
like are kind of more popular than others?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the how to, this is, listen,
if you guys are starting a channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to videos are going to get you
everywhere, you know, uh, how to maximize
[SPEAKER_01]: yields, those types of videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, those are going to get you
very far, but, uh, you have to know what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just regurgitate the same
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just want to do it because it
gets a lot of views and they end up
[SPEAKER_01]: putting the same wrong information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you want to, in my opinion,
if you're going to do a how to video,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure you is from experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's always, it comes out better,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember I've had so many of those
videos pop off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I did a podcast episode,
how to grow dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that thing got like three,
400,000 views.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh my gosh, how to videos
definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was your most popular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that was the most popular one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: 579,000 views.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually, can I ask you something real
quick on a personal note?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it like going outside for you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get recognized a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause at this point you are like a thing,
you know, how does that look like for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just a small, small home grower,
you know, like when, when, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is it, how does it feel like it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you actually feel it when you go
outside or is it something that stays on
[SPEAKER_01]: the internet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I've gotten recognized a
handful of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got recognized at a Raiders game one
time randomly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was this guy sitting next to me and
he's like looking at me all weird and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally he asked me, yeah,
finally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like super pumped and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was out to eat with my fiance and her
family one time and pretty nice
[SPEAKER_00]: restaurant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in the bathroom and some guys
like, Hey, how you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he worked there.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was a cook, like pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he, you heard, you just hear my
voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, do I know you from somewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like later on, he came back out
when I was sitting down with the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, Oh, I do know you, you're from
YouTube and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you feel, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did that feel like cool or are you
embarrassed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just a little dip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when you're in front of a
family, luckily my fiance's family is very
[SPEAKER_00]: accepting, very accepting of what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very accepting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little embarrassing to just be
recognized in front of family and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, everything's super
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I went to MJ BizCon
recognized probably about, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a dozen times, two dozen times,
but that's a, that's an event for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I mean, for the most part,
I just, I don't really, I don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: care to be recognized and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if somebody does recognize me and
comes up to me and says, what's up at that
[SPEAKER_00]: school, like let's have a conversation
about growing where I said in a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast, it was kind of a rare breed in a
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's not many people really in the
grand scheme of things in like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: the world that actually grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we got something common,
like let's hang out and talk, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's, I think it's one of the most
enjoyable parts of the situation is
[SPEAKER_01]: connecting with the person.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cool when you connect on the
internet and then person is even cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talked about like hot topics,
things that are kind of popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about cold topics that people kind of
don't seem interested in these days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you want the exact titles for the
cold topics, you'll go to my page and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out all the titles that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, yeah, I think it used to be
when I started watching, it used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: weekly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week by week.
[SPEAKER_01]: That used to be what people did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week one, a flower week to a flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, I guess those topics have died
down and now it's more like the seed to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest situation, which is more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I still, like I said, I still enjoy
the week to week, but those are the topics
[SPEAKER_01]: that like week number one, a flower number
two, number three, you're not going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: much traction if those are your titles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a very specific amount
of people that are looking for that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific information and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me personally, I feel like things in
veg, like the vegetation stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what he really clicks on those
videos as much as flower stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it's all about the title and
thumbnail to whether or not the person
[SPEAKER_00]: clicks, whether or not they watch is a
whole different story.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to get that initial click,
which is what shows up as a view on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube, showing a flowering plant,
you're gonna get a lot more clicks than
[SPEAKER_00]: you would just showing a veg planter or
even a seedling plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although some seedling videos do pretty
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you say week one video,
you typically does pretty good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, week one seedling, just starting
a new grow, you know, people want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those videos do pretty good,
but the veg videos haven't been doing good
[SPEAKER_00]: for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower videos do a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed to harvest videos, like you
mentioned, do really, really well with
[SPEAKER_00]: people who see, see everything,
you know, from seed all the way to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there are definitely some,
some cold topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think of other cold topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like unboxing videos are cold now,
like nobody really clicks on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might be too saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I think you guys spoke on
this, but the light technology seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: have slowed down as far as like how fast
it was moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feels like now you kind of getting
the same light over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now where I used to watch channels and
I didn't mention them because of this,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they used to just review lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm not watching that anymore because
this seems like it's the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: the same, we, we maybe reached a little
ceiling for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So perhaps that's why unboxing videos have
also maybe felt to because the equipment
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't seem to be advancing as fast as it
was just a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the lighting technology just,
just in the past year in particular has
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of gotten a little, a little boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these companies are releasing the same
diodes and not really doing much as far as
[SPEAKER_01]: upgrades and it's good on price is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It feels like the pricing is now getting,
getting better because everybody has the
[SPEAKER_01]: same components, but so that's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as the unboxing and the
excitement of a new toy, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it, that, that excitement is not there
right now for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's still worth it to create
beginner type content on like basic
[SPEAKER_00]: topics, like how to germinate,
how to train plants, how to set up a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent when there are like a countless
number of other of these types of videos
[SPEAKER_00]: on YouTube already?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like saying, you know,
the same reason why movies keep getting
[SPEAKER_01]: remade, uh, it's a new generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people, new people being born.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think there is a space
for, uh, let's say even somebody that's
[SPEAKER_01]: watching this video right now that's
thinking about joining YouTube and
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking, uh, well, what, what can I
contribute?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you got to contribute is your voice
and your style, the way that you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to say that information to others.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it is important to still make
those videos in your way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, uh, there might be a person that
specifically learns the way that you
[SPEAKER_01]: teach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's your duty to do that for that
person.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that, but if you're a content
creator, then you're moving off of energy
[SPEAKER_01]: of, of, uh, excitement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited every time I set up a new
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very excited every time I plant a new
seed, because I don't know what it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm excited to see what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not record that and share that every
time I do it every time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a good point there.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially as legalization sleeps
across the nation here, it's like more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more people are new, you know,
it's, it's more and more people coming on
[SPEAKER_00]: board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having these basic beginner type videos
is valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with YouTube, the ranking
comes into play, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how old the video is and some old videos,
certainly is still going to show up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: ranking when you search for them,
but newer videos could potentially show up
[SPEAKER_00]: newer on the rankings.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, you bring up a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you should always be looking for new
content.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, even if it's the same thing
again, uh, you're doing it again,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's new, you know, it's a new day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might do it a little different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're, you're using a different
kind of P pod than you used before,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, anything, anything that's
different could be beneficial to somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: watching to a, to a beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like you said, uh, with legalization,
just about to, well, it keeps getting
[SPEAKER_01]: better for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to say it's going to
federally legal because that just keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: taking forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, every day you get new people that
are interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so be there for those people,
just like somebody was there for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking a lot about YouTube and
YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's where, you know,
me and you are kind of our passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where, that's where our focus is
on, but there are other communities on
[SPEAKER_00]: other platforms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on gardening
content on the other platforms like
[SPEAKER_00]: Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, so on and so
forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, you know, um, I haven't had the best
of luck on other platforms.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just joined X.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just found you over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I heard that X is actually,
uh, uh, very friendly to creators on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on our side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I got the verified badge
and, and, and let's see is if that's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram has been bad for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've had profiles get banned a
bunch of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and, and, and, you know, it makes it,
it's to the point where you can't really,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just banned you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even tell you why you can't
contact anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like you can't plead your case to
anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like, so definitely don't
recommend that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, discord has been good so far,
you know, um, those are the ones that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: using at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I focus mostly on YouTube though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where my bread and butter is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to go on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: They slapped me on the wrist before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my page on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have one, but they don't like some
of the content I post there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried joining a lot of the Facebook
groups because there's like a lot of grow
[SPEAKER_00]: groups and man, I have not signed up to a
group and left a group so quickly before
[SPEAKER_00]: the toxicity in some of those groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I could not stand, you know,
somebody posts a picture of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, what's wrong with my plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get 50 million replies from people
and some of them are hating on the guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so much mixed information and
just hate and, uh, same thing with Reddit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like haven't really had a good experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, at least for me, there was
negativity, a lot of negativity on there
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just, it didn't feel like a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want to speak it like it's a
blanket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are good communities out
there within Reddit, good subreddits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was one science back one and
it was like our bud science, which had
[SPEAKER_00]: some good information on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're really trying to break things down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, yeah, my experience on those
platforms hasn't been that well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, they're always penalizing
people and they have this review program
[SPEAKER_00]: when you appeal stuff that's automatically
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if real people look at
these posts that get appealed and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and you just get shot down and counts get
deleted and then they come back and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: mess over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I personally haven't had a great
experience on some of these other
[SPEAKER_00]: platforms as well, but looking into the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you see gardening content on
platforms like YouTube five years from
[SPEAKER_00]: now?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it could be to the point where
we're cooking, you know, how you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of cooking people showing you how to
cook and it's a thing and everybody does
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this has the potential to do
the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's, I don't know if it's
really going to go like that, but this has
[SPEAKER_01]: the potential to do the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like, uh, once homegrown is legal,
if you consume the plant, I don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see a reason to not get into it
yourself and just have like a little tent
[SPEAKER_01]: or something going, you know, like,
uh, the, the expenses that you would have
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay to get any grow going pace itself
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're somebody that consumes already
just by the grows that you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, because of that, as,
as long as we, the content creators keep
[SPEAKER_01]: doing what we were supposed to do and
getting people excited about the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we could get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get more people joining and, and,
and making it a community, just like the
[SPEAKER_01]: cooking community is just maybe in a
smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, there's, there's so much,
so much business opportunity and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and what we're doing so many ways to
monetize the channels that I just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how YouTube is not letting it
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's medicinal plant companies that
want to actively, uh, uh, they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise in our channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, that's a money revenue that,
you know, you, you're not letting us have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not letting the company do what
they're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you get in the way of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's so much there that's
left on the table right now that I can't
[SPEAKER_01]: wait till that starts happening where
YouTube says, Hey, we're going to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: these companies that want to be in your
channel to monetize their product in your
[SPEAKER_01]: channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think this space is oversaturated
or do you foresee oversaturation happening
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like anything else, you know,
just, just like the cooking thing is that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can go right back to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you a matter of fact,
let's just take it away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watch a whole bunch of different content
creators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, if you love the plant,
if you really want to learn, you're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat this up, you're going to consume
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to keep wanting that
information from as many different people
[SPEAKER_01]: as you could get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So while yes, you can have a bunch of
people doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only going to have a certain amount
of people that are going to be doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're only going to have a certain amount
of people that are going to be giving
[SPEAKER_01]: quality content, you know, as far as how
it looks, how it sounds, and people that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, that actively trying to
find an audience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody's going to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not really worried about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you focus on doing good work,
you're going to find an audience
[SPEAKER_01]: eventually, you know, cause, cause it's
not like I'm only going to watch you and
[SPEAKER_01]: then not watch high again, you know,
because I watched Terpy highs,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to watch Bill Ward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to watch everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I totally get what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of content creators coming
into this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have really good content starting
brand new, starting fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some content isn't so good, but,
uh, but they try.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for those that are
just getting started creating gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: content?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in general, I guess it doesn't have,
you know, not, not only gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just since I've done so many different
types of content, uh, what has always
[SPEAKER_01]: motivated me is, is showing what I'm
excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I saw somewhere that if you want to be
interesting, you have to be interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just show the people what it is that
you're interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it becomes very easy to put that
on camera.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think that, Oh my God, I've never
seen this on a plant before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then record that and show me that that
excitement is already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already saw it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to make it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the best advice is that is show
me what it is that you're excited about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to connect with you on that
same level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can continue to do that through
the video, then you have a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think for those folks that are
looking to start that haven't started that
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like they aren't able to start
because of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've talked to some people like,
Oh, I don't have a camera yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a DSLR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have a $3,000 camera to
get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need that.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use their iPhone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can get away with using your
iPhone and you could buy a $15 tripod on
[SPEAKER_00]: the hand and just go around and doing that
microphones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now for a really good one, you could get a
good one for a hundred bucks, even cheaper
[SPEAKER_00]: than that on sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can start off with really not
spending a whole lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even need the microphone,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just your phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can definitely get started
with little to no equipment and still make
[SPEAKER_00]: some good quality content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured that was worthy of mentioning
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also I always say to people start with
where you're from, where you're at with
[SPEAKER_01]: what you have, like start from right
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to buy new running shoes to
start running.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you don't need the, the,
the fancy stuff to start doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started doing comedy, I didn't,
uh, I didn't have anyone to do the skits
[SPEAKER_01]: with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I ended up doing instead of,
uh, you know, beating myself up over it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not doing the skits that I wanted to do is
I started dressing up as different people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of kind of what I do now in
my channel, you know, how that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that transferred over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play different characters.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would play my mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll play myself, you know, and just set
up the cameras and just record myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once those videos started going viral,
everybody wanted to be in my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Famous people wanted to be in my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get enough people in my videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and it just started because
I just didn't have anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start with where you're at with the
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that forces you, if anything,
to be more creative because you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the fancy equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to figure it out and figuring it
out is what's going to make you different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm the one dressing like this because
I don't have the people, but I'm now,
[SPEAKER_01]: now I'm the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I made it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, don't think of your situation as a
disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it as an opportunity to be
creative and show who you really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bring your own style, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have your own style that you
brought to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put yourself out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't copy anybody, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's, uh, people get themselves
in this situation where they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: copy somebody because they see,
oh, somebody else's success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me do what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had probably about a half a dozen
people copy the way that I do interviews.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm humbled that somebody was inspired by
my work and wanted to copy the way that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, people quickly quit because it's
not them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're not having fun creating
content the way that somebody else is
[SPEAKER_00]: creating content, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So do what you want to do your own style
and have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are good ways to go about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, geez, you even went to,
uh, you went so far to create parody
[SPEAKER_00]: videos, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You created one on me on my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's actually a great segue for
that because.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the reason I was trying to get
on your channel at that point was because
[SPEAKER_01]: because of how, uh, suppressed you feel
and when you're making content and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting all these hours and no one's
watching your content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, man, like this guy has a
platform, you know, let me figure out a
[SPEAKER_01]: way to get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just reached out to you and
unfortunately you were booked till next
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and I said, well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I still want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there you go back to use what you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I disguise me as you and interview me
as you, you know, I made it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did what I needed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't do it with you, but I still did
it, you know, so don't ever let your
[SPEAKER_01]: situation limit you.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a great idea, you know,
it's going to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try it out with whatever you have around
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to make it stand out even
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, and the cool part about this is
that I'm not here with you in real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with episode 118, the same one,
the same number as the parody that I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was a great, that was
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to do episode one 18 because that
was what it was in the parody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was like fitting for
that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, my, my list of P you'd be
surprised there's at least I say one to
[SPEAKER_00]: two people per week that reach out to me
and want to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the list I have of potential guests
exceeds 200 people now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I was booked out for the rest of
the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt really bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel really bad when somebody has
to come on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, Oh, I just, I've got so such
a long list right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, like maybe in the future type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm, I couldn't get you on at
that time, but you got my, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got my attention and, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We made it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A different talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope, uh, hope the listeners enjoy this.

thumbs up button and leave a comment down
[SPEAKER_00]: below and let us know what you liked about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, should I do something like that,
this in the future, you know, or should I
[SPEAKER_00]: stick to just talking about gardening
specific topics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know your thoughts down in the
comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Daddy Buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and kind of what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, um, on YouTube is my main platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just go to YouTube and, uh,
go to the ground under the stairs and
[SPEAKER_01]: check out the videos that I have over
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you want somewhere easy to start
starting season 10, uh, episode one,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is when I just moved to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got dumped in my last season,
so I had to move to Alaska.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a nice fresh start for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a nice first start from the
series.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know how I start my,
my seeds, if you want to know how to start
[SPEAKER_01]: from clone, that starts from zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, season 10, episode one,
as far as what's coming in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I would actually like to do an extra
section in, in my channel with some
[SPEAKER_01]: interviews that just deal with content
creation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would love it if you guys are
listening, if you like this type of
[SPEAKER_01]: content, uh, about content creation,
uh, to jump over to my channel and see,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, what we're going to do over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully I can have you in there as one
of the guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be an honor for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to come on and do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you did enjoy this type of content,
Big Daddy Bud's going to be making similar
[SPEAKER_00]: type of content in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing
what you come up with in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, thanks for coming on,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it and hope you have a good
rest of your day.
