[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: ViperSpector sent me over their brand new
growlite, the P1000 LED growlite,
[SPEAKER_00]: and in this video I'm going to unbox the
unit and I'm also going to do a par test
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of five LED growlites that
ViperSpector is releasing in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have the P1500 LED growlite,
the P2500 LED growlite, the VP1000 LED
[SPEAKER_00]: growlite, and the VP2000 LED growlite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of the
growlite's features in this video,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I will link all of the growlites I
just mentioned in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, opening up the box and it looks like
I opened up the box upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oops!
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing I'm pulling out the box here
is rope ratchet hangers, here is their
[SPEAKER_00]: user manual, it includes safety
information, specifications about the
[SPEAKER_00]: P1000, P1500, P2500, and some suggestions
on how to use the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a small card here which says what
to do if you're happy or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: unhappy, a six-foot power cord,
a wire hanging kit, and of course the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the par test, I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ500 par meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus five
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers, and the measurements are in
PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: This test is done just to give you a
general idea of what the power output is
[SPEAKER_00]: for this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking measurements in a grow tent and
the reflective walls could increase the
[SPEAKER_00]: par numbers, so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: This growlite has a flowering coverage
area of two foot by two foot, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: taking measurements in a two foot by four
foot grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll do my best to keep my par meter on
one side of the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take measurements at three different
distances, 12 inches away, 18 inches away,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 24 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: All three of those distances are
recommended in their user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: This growlite does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this part test, I'll keep the dimmer
at 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 100%, this unit pulls 101 watts from
the wall at 0.83 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's get into the
measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also linked all of the Viperspectra's
new 2020 growlites in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below, so check that out if you
want to learn more about any of their new
[SPEAKER_00]: growlites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video,
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed it, please click that
thumbs up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
