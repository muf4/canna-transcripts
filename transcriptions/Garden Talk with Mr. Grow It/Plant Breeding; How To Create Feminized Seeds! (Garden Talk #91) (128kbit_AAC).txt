[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feminite seeds are seeds that are 98 to 99
percent female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pop them and you are more than sure
that will be females.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never start with seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always start with clones that are
tested, that are very well known,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are very, very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing on a breeding
project, like I said, is the genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: you breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the health of the plants, the veggie
nutrients, the high content of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: will help create and harvest a lot more
seeds than if you use a bloom nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do this right from one plant,
you can get like thousands of seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast, this episode
number 91.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Grow More,

creating feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to get into in
today's episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about his style of breeding
and how to create feminized seeds.

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Grow More,
Stress Less.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm so honored to be on your show.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, glad to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been a large handful of
people that have requested for you to come
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited that I finally got to hold
you and was able to get you on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching your shows and your
YouTube videos for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a pleasure to be on your show
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so cool to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today we're going to get into feminized
plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, more and more people are
choosing feminized seeds over regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they really like the ability to
grow plants from seed and for it to always
[SPEAKER_00]: be female, not have to worry about male
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this episode, I'd like to have more
of a beginner-friendly conversation in
[SPEAKER_00]: regards to getting started breeding and
then creating feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, what we do with every episode
is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, my name is Vio.
[SPEAKER_01]: My real name is Breviation from VRL.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming from Eastern Europe,
Romania.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm coming from a bodybuilding background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been bodybuilding for the last 18
years of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started bodybuilding when I was like 13
years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right when I started, it became a
passion for me and I got obsessed with
[SPEAKER_01]: bodybuilding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to become a professional
bodybuilder from like when I was 14 years
[SPEAKER_01]: old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I followed my dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at 20 years old, I came to U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: to compete in a bodybuilding show.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stayed here for the rest of the
remaining time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came here in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I reached my lifetime goal to become a
professional bodybuilder at 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: After almost 16 years of chasing this
dream and coming all the way from Eastern
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, Romania to U.S., it was a huge
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always had that passion for
bodybuilding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to make it all the way where I
put my dream at.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right after I finished bodybuilding and
I reached my main goal to become a
[SPEAKER_01]: professional bodybuilder, I started to
kind of get depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I even had another thing to aim
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached my goal that I was trying to get
for the last 16 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm here and I'm kind of lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what to do anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I discovered growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I immediately got passionate about
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with three little clones back in
2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it became a passion right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like right away I was there every single
second opening my closet door to check on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants and doing research for like
hours and hours and hours and losing
[SPEAKER_01]: nights, watching YouTube videos,
watching you and all the other people on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube trying to learn how to grow and
going back into my little growing
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things evolved pretty fast for me
because I dive so deep into it like with
[SPEAKER_01]: bodybuilding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put everything I had, all my focus and
all my time into growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I evolved pretty, pretty quick from my
first grow in a closet in soil with flora,
[SPEAKER_01]: not flora flakes, with salt nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into my second grow when I did deep
water culture and I grew one single plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in a five by five space when I got massive
results from that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a massive yield and I got great
results and that built my confidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also I want to mention that the plant was
in my life while I was doing bodybuilding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped me reach my goal to become a
professional bodybuilding by give me
[SPEAKER_01]: relief from pain because bodybuilding is a
very, very demanding sport where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: to lift a lot of weight and you have all
kinds of joint pains or muscle pains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I used the medicinal properties of the
plant long before to start growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I started growing was like,
I really need to learn to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned everything about this and I dive
deep into it and that's where I am right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then how long have you been breeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did that come in?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I like to ask, I've had a handful
of breeders on this podcast in the past,
[SPEAKER_00]: small handful, and I like to ask them,
what makes you a reputable breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'm not consider myself a
breeder yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I aim to become one of the best breeders
in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this moment, I'm not considering
myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just learning and experience and doing
all kinds of projects to perfect my
[SPEAKER_01]: skills, but I'm not considering myself a
breeder yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been breeding just for a little over
a year now, but like I said, as with
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, I'm diving deep in and I'm doing
a lot of research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm listening to a lot of books about
breeding, about plant health and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to perfect my breeding
projects every single time I'm doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what made me different?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the passion that I put into the
plant, the energy that I put into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and the approach that I have of
breeding that we'll get later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get on later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then before we actually met here,
we talked about what the topic would be
[SPEAKER_00]: and I sent you some questions in regards
to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first set of questions I sent you
was inbreeding, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from like F1, F2, F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had mentioned that you haven't
really ventured into that avenue yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: that you specialized in feminized.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're going to
focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those that don't know feminize,
can you break it down for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is meant by feminized?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in simple words, you take a female
clone plant and you reverse it with a
[SPEAKER_01]: spray and you turn it into a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you take the pollen from this
female slash male plant and you pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: another female plant and you get five
feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So feminized seeds are seeds that are 98
to 99 percent female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you pop them and you are more than sure
that will be females.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with the feminized seeds,
they are not as stable as the regular
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means they can germ if the genetics
are not mixing together well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I'm what I'm getting at is if you
pop regular seeds and you want just female
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, you have chances of 50 percent
female, 50 percent male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you are 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you pop feminized seeds,
you have got 99 percent chances to get
[SPEAKER_01]: female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably the herm percent is less than
if it's a good project, less than one or
[SPEAKER_01]: two percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you pop I pop, for example,
my last run, 33 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have any herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I pop another 72 seeds and I have
just two herms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the herm percentage can vary from
cultivar to cultivar, from genetic to
[SPEAKER_01]: genetic, you know, how well the genetics
are combining themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either way, I consider feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you if you try to grow female plants,
a more advantage way to go than regular
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of taking a step back,
there's a lot of folks that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: getting started with breeding,
you know, and they they're kind of limited
[SPEAKER_00]: on the space that they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say is the smallest size
grow space that someone can do this type
[SPEAKER_00]: of breeding in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can do these types of breeding
in any kind of space, even if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: like a two by two tent or whatever you
have, you get you get your plant that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to reverse and you start spraying it
with the reversal spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to have another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the smallest project that you can get
done is just bringing two plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get one plant that you reverse and a
plant that you will pollinate with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it can be a two by four space,
even a two by four to feed two plants or a
[SPEAKER_01]: two by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get this done in any kind of
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do this, it's right from one
plant, you can get like thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need the minimum possible space that
you can grow two plants in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as tools and equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of folks that are getting
into breeding, they already know how to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow the plant regularly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a majority of maybe 99 percent of
people already know how to grow the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least they should know how to grow
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just getting into breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any other like separate tools in
equipment that they would need in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: breed?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no like different tools or things
that you need in order to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: All you need to do is to to grow the
plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just need to have your reversal
plan in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you need to have the timing
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to have to know how to grow
super healthy plants, because my point of
[SPEAKER_01]: in my in my breeding, my main point is the
healthier you keep the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: the better you will the better the the
genetics will will like will mix with each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you need to it's like humans
when you try to when when humans try to
[SPEAKER_01]: make kids the healthier the parents are,
the healthier will transmit into the into
[SPEAKER_01]: the children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to do with the with the plants,
keep them as healthy as possible during
[SPEAKER_01]: before and during the breeding process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the offsprings, the seeds will be super
healthy seeds with the best genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's so that's that's what's
all come come to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would actually happen if the plant
did have like deficiencies, like say the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant was yellowing or something like that
towards the lower part of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pretty minor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they went and they did they started
that reversal process with the spray.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there like what are the downsides to
doing that versus starting with a healthy
[SPEAKER_00]: plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you kind of mentioned that the
health would go down to the offspring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But are they going to see any issues
during the reversal process?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what to tell them
from now, because they there can happen a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from my point of view, you know,
when you have mineral deficiencies in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans like folic acid in a pregnant woman
or calcium deficiency in a pregnant woman,
[SPEAKER_01]: that will transmit into the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have folic acid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The kid can be born with birth defects
with channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly how it's called birth
channel defect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if the mother have vitamin D or calcium
deficiencies, the kid can have different
[SPEAKER_01]: like bone mineral deficiencies and like
different, you know, different problems
[SPEAKER_01]: later on life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being into the bodybuilding and health
health side of the things with humans,
[SPEAKER_01]: I translate that into my plants as well,
because it's kind of the same process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I cannot tell exactly what will happen,
but I can say that the healthier you keep
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants, the better you the better
genetics you can create on your seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the health care genetic you can
transmit into the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so if the plant were to have
deficiencies during that reversal process,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you mentioned, would there be
potential mutant plants that happen or
[SPEAKER_00]: like crazy characteristics that come out
of the offspring because of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's it's very possible to have like
mutant plants or I would say more likely
[SPEAKER_01]: to have more harm harm problems later on,
because the DNA of the plants didn't mix
[SPEAKER_01]: and staying the right the place that it's
supposed to, you know, so it can be more
[SPEAKER_01]: like more harm chances or more mutant
plants or seeds not germinating correctly
[SPEAKER_01]: later on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there can be a lot of problems,
but I cannot point exactly because the
[SPEAKER_01]: science is not yet there yet on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: What will happen if this plant will have
magnesium deficiency or so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I can say for sure is that the
healthier you can keep your plants during
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeding projects, the better you are,
you are off with your with your offspring,
[SPEAKER_01]: with your seeds and genetics later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as the seed to use to
begin, a lot of people say that regular
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds is the only thing you should use and
that you should not use feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any risks with starting with a
feminized seed and using that,
[SPEAKER_00]: reversing that versus a regular seed?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, first of all, I don't like to start
with with with seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start directly with the genetics that
are very, very well known, very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The characteristics are that I'm looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm starting with with genetics
that are already good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they are selected.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are breeder cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are cuts that are very, very valuable
because the whole the whole thing boils
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What genetics you can bring to make an
even better genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start from seed, you have a
huge variation that you can you can you
[SPEAKER_01]: can pop a hundred seeds and you cannot
find one good plant on a hundred seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so that's that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never start with with seed plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always start with clones that are
tested, that are very well known,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are very, very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they have the characteristics
that I'm looking for, the THC,
[SPEAKER_01]: the medicinal properties that I'm looking
for, the the color that I'm looking for,
[SPEAKER_01]: the vigor that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I never start with seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm starting with with clones and I'm
trying to get the best genetics that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody can they can breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main thing is what genetics you
start with, you know, because not
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody have access to the best genetics
in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's that's one of my main
focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finding the best genetics and hunting the
seeds that I'm creating to find the best
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that I can bring into my other
other genetics, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't really worry about if that
clone came from a seed that was regular or
[SPEAKER_00]: if that clone came from a plant that was
feminized, started from a feminized seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as that clone, as long as you know
that the mother plant was a healthy plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: produce what you were looking for within
the genetics, you'll use that clone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll grow it out and then you reverse
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it came from a feminized
seeds or a regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I care is to be stable, to have a lot
of value, to bring a lot of value to my
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding project, you know, yield,
color, medicinal properties, the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: structure, vigor in flower, in veg,
and all those things, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care if it's come from feminized
or regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then getting into the characteristics,
we really depends on the breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the breeder is looking for in the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you look for within a female plant
to use for breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I'm looking, like I said,
for that high value genetics that has what
[SPEAKER_01]: people are looking at the moment in the
market, you know, and people right now in
[SPEAKER_01]: the market are looking for high medicinal
properties, like high percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal properties, THC, CBD,
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, people are looking for very good bag
appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So color, again, it's a very important
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple color plant will be more appealing
than a green plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm looking for frost, how frosty
and how good the bud look, the structure
[SPEAKER_01]: of the bud, how well the plant grow in
veg, how much the plant yields,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also there are terpenes that our
people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are looking more for sweet
candy turps, and some people are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: more for gas and OG kind of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all depends what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different customers that are
looking for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to breed for everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody to have something good for
everybody, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's so subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, yeah, it really depends on,
again, what the breeder or the breeder's
[SPEAKER_00]: customers are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I appreciate you explaining that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into the actual reversal
process using the sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a couple of different ways
you can go about it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There is clotosulfate, there is silver
theosulfate, for short, STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also gibberic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you said you don't have
experience with the gibberic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we won't talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe you have experience with
both the STS and the clotosilver.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with STS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walk us through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about doing the sprays?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do you spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you spray?
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the only thing that I've used on my
plants is the STS spray, the abbreviation
[SPEAKER_01]: for the STS spray.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically that come in two bottles,
two bottles that you need to mix up and
[SPEAKER_01]: create a spray, that you spray your plant,
your reversal plant for three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first three weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take your reversal plant,
you put it on flower, you put it on a
[SPEAKER_01]: 12-12 schedule, light schedule,
and right away you start the process of
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I spray it between one and two
times a day for the first 15 to 20 days of
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in 15 to 20 days, you should start
seeing instead of flower, you should start
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing pollen sacs forming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when you know that the reversal
process was successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start seeing pollen sacs, you start
seeing a male plant instead of a female
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You start seeing a male plant with flower
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing and what I've done wrong in
the past, and I want to mention right
[SPEAKER_01]: here, it's the timing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start my breeding projects a year
ago, putting the plant that I reverse and
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other plants that I'm trying to
pollinate, putting them into flower in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time that my plant was
reversing, was a little bit too late in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower for my flower plants to be
pollinated and create seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to mention that the plant that
you want to reverse, you need to put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower and start spraying it at least two
weeks, between two to three weeks before
[SPEAKER_01]: you put all your seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: All your flower plants that you try to
pollinate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start reversing my plants today for
the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I start my other female plants
that I'm trying to mix with this male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, reverse plant into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put them all in the same tent
and I'm kind of doing a open pollination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the reversal plant in a corner of
the tent and I'm putting a fan blowing
[SPEAKER_01]: right on that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the time it's come, the pollen
sacs will open and the pollen will go in
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also taking the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to keep my reversal plant in a
smaller kind of pot because I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to take that plant and shake it above
the other plants when I'm seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen on the plant because just by having
a fan blowing on the plant, sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to actually, when the time it
comes, take the plant and shake it above
[SPEAKER_01]: the other plants so all the pollen will go
on the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by doing this, allowing two to two
weeks for the reversal plant to start
[SPEAKER_01]: reversing, you get the perfect timing for
the other plants to flower and be ready to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how I got the best results and
the most seeds because when I was putting
[SPEAKER_01]: the reversal plant with the other
flowering plants, the female plants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time in flower was not enough time to
pollinate and have the seeds mature and be
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to harvest in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just take your reversal plant,
you spread for three weeks, you start the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering process two weeks later on the
flowering plants and you just pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: that other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important thing on a breeding
project, like I said, is the genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: you breed with and the health of the
plants because as in humans, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to obtain, if you're a kid,
you'll try to have your kid play in NBA
[SPEAKER_01]: and you are a 5'5 and your wife is a 5'5
tall person, you don't have the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: to have your kid playing in NBA,
whatever you do, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So genetics are the main part of this
breeding game, finding the right genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: to breed and then the health of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so let me just make sure I
understand this correctly because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never done, I've never created feminized
seeds before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have my own cross, brisker OG cross
with Pakistan Valley, but I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've actually done inbreeding all the
way down to an F3.
[SPEAKER_00]: Creating feminized seeds is a different
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me make sure I understand what you
had just mentioned there, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that you're going to spray,
you'll flip to a 12-12 light cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll spray the plant for the first 14
days you'll apply that spray once.
[SPEAKER_01]: More likely like 20 days, 20, 20 days,
15 to 20 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the 14-day mark, that's when you're
taking your other plant from veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so then that plant is going to
start to flower and you're continuing to
[SPEAKER_00]: spray that other plant up to the 20-day or
21-day mark, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at that point, the plant has
created pollen sacs or it's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: create pollen sacs and then the timing
should match up to where the plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to pollinate is ready for
pollination and the plant that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: sprayed is releasing pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take the plant that is
releasing pollen and you're actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, letting the oscillating fan blow
pollen into the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing the open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're even taking the plant, grabbing it
up and shaking it over the other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the same thing on the last run.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pick up the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a two gallon container is what I was
in and shaking it over the other plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure it's really well pollinated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that pretty much what you had just
mentioned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I explain that correctly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's pretty much what I was
mentioning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to mention that when you spray
your plant, when you put the plant that
[SPEAKER_01]: you reverse, you don't spread into the
tent with the other female plants because
[SPEAKER_01]: you run the risk of spraying on the other
plants and reversing the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take my plant and I spread separately
from the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the plant is all dry,
I put it back into the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing, this STD, STS, this STS
spray, it's very, very sensitive to the
[SPEAKER_01]: light and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you spray your plant, make sure
you are not spraying it with the lights on
[SPEAKER_01]: and in a very hot environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I like to take my plant that I
reversed, let it sit outside of the tent
[SPEAKER_01]: only in a bathtub for 10, 15 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spread, then I let it sit to dry it up
for 10, 15 minutes and then I put it back
[SPEAKER_01]: into the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you spraying just once a day or are
you spraying multiple times a day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once a day usually, but sometimes I'm
doing twice a day, like especially at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning to make sure that the plant is
well spread and will reverse correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I want to mention that you better
have multiple plants reversing than just
[SPEAKER_01]: one based on your space that you're
breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, I like to breathe in five by
five tents and I like to have at least two
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that I reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same genetic, but two plants that I
reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I make sure that I have enough pollen
to pollinate the whole tent because you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to get to the point where you
reverse only one plant and you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: enough pollen to pollinate all your other
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You better have extra pollen or more
pollen than not enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing that I'm encouraging people
is, like I said, that time frame of two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, you can take one of the plants and
start reversing it two weeks before,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you can have your other plants start
reversing three weeks before, or you can
[SPEAKER_01]: have three plants like one week before you
put other in flower, two weeks before and
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because different genetics reverse
different and release pollen in two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you never reverse that plant before,
you don't know exactly when the pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: sacs will open for sure and how much
pollen they will produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you better have more pollen and more
chances to pollinate all your other plants
[SPEAKER_01]: than less.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that plant that you are reversing
or the plants that you are reversing,
[SPEAKER_00]: how big are you growing them generally?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned you like for them to be
in smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What size containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually like if I do in one gallon pots,
I do one gallon pots, cocoa, or I do the
[SPEAKER_01]: big, I think they're called big mama or
whatever, the eight by eight rocket cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either I do in the big rocket cubes or
one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I'm trying to pollinate,
I get a nice dry back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants are super light and I just
go and shake it over the other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant, I like to be at least like two
feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like huge plants because when you
have huge plants, they cannot sustain
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get like, like the pods will get
heavy and you don't flop over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer to have few different plants,
but smaller ones that I can work better
[SPEAKER_01]: with, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I have two plants and are two or three
feet tall, it's a lot easier for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate the other plants when the time
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use for fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: For fertilizer, I use Atena AG nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a salt based nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people ask me, but organics
are not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil is not better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my answer is always do where you can
keep your plants the healthiest possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have your plants super healthy in
soil, do it in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you never use soil or anything or
whatever works for you, whatever can keep
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants the healthiest possible,
that's what you need to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter if it's organic or
synthetic nutrients because we'll give the
[SPEAKER_01]: same input to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give the same nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The synthetic nutrients, the salt
nutrients will give the direct input.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic need to be break down by
organic matters and give to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, organic, it's a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And soil, it's a little bit more
complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe it's a whole science how you
can keep your plants healthy and create a
[SPEAKER_01]: nice microbiome.
[SPEAKER_01]: A microbiome into the medium that can feed
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the salt nutrients are a lot easier to
control and keep your plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my choice is salt nutrients because I
can control everything to a T.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can control the AC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can control the pH exactly where I want
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can keep my plants super happy and
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've reversed a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also brought your other plant in that
you're going to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done the pollination process.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens to the reverse plant after
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you collecting pollen at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you just killing off that plant
that you've reversed because you no longer
[SPEAKER_00]: need it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually, usually reversed plants are not
producing as much pollen like a real male
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually it's not much pollen left after
I pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shake the plant so hard that there is no
pollen left into the plant by the time
[SPEAKER_01]: it's finished.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually I don't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have nothing to collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just throw them away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an easy process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do it anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take a plant and reverse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes only three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't make sense to keep it
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just cut it and I spread out the other
plants into the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I continued the seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the seeds are forming in the plant's
buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess my next question would be how
long is that plant growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like how long should the female plant grow
and then be harvested in order to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the yield of seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I imagine that if you're
harvesting too early, you have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: immature seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you just let your plants grow and grow
and grow and grow until they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: dead and then harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what's your process for harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually my process is I let my plants
grow as much as they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I watch my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even count how many weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot tell you I do like after I
pollinate another five or six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually it's a little longer process
than flowering plants for bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit like probably like a
week to two weeks longer process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to take my time and watch the
plants how they perform.
[SPEAKER_01]: But definitely I don't like to see my
plants dead all the way dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm harvesting my plants and I like to see
my plants still green and vibrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't do any kind of flushing or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to keep my plants healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I usually do, I take a small bud
towards the end and I check the seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: see if the seeds are mature enough or I
need to let them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, leave them longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's better than cut them short.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let them grow for as long as they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check like buds to see how the seeds are
inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they are still green, give them another
week or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't rush them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to learn to read your plants and
know when to take them down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, it's a little longer,
like usually two weeks longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you cut your plant, like your female
plant that you use for breeding,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you cut it in flower for medicine,
at week eight or nine, let the seeded
[SPEAKER_01]: plant go for 10 or 11 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you want mature seeds inside the
bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want green seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want all the way mature seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get the best germination rate
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you do harvest the plant,
the process of breaking up the buds and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of sorting out the seeds,
what do you do for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you just like breaking it up by hand
and then putting it into like a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaning machine or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do everything by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a trim bean where I break down,
I put all my seeded buds and I start
[SPEAKER_01]: breaking it down like into like very fine
material and seeds all mixed together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's a process of shaking that
trim bean where it separates the seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: from all the green.
[SPEAKER_01]: Green material, you know, and you then
take it by hand and you whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: however you want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'm at the beginning of my
road and I'm not doing like huge breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: projects when I need separating machines
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: My process is all handmade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take the seeds by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pack them by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do everything by hand for the moment,
all by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pretty much that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody needs to find their own
methods that work for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely it's a very meticulous process,
taking all those seeds by hand,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's all worth it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to go back to hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about a little bit earlier in
the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a little bit deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to know about
hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear horror story after horror story
after horror story that people are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're planting them and they're getting
a whole bunch of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we need to know about
hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what are the chances they occur
and how do you avoid getting
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodites?
[SPEAKER_01]: So hermaphrodites are plants that are
female plants, but they start developing
[SPEAKER_01]: also male characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they start, so they're 99% female
plants with flowers, but they got pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: sacs, few pollen sacs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually those pollen sacs come at the
bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all the feminized seeds, especially
if they are first generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you take a sawn genetic and you breathe
it to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different genetic for the first time,
the chances of hermaphrodites are a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit higher and there are chances of
hermaphrodites for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the main factor with
hermaphrodites is the way you treat your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants when you grow them, like the
environment where you keep your plants in,
[SPEAKER_01]: the light schedule and how you stress them
because I pop a ton of seeds from
[SPEAKER_01]: different people, my own seeds and I don't
have a bunch of hermaphrodites because my
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't stress the plants in the first
three, four weeks of flower because
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds get very easily stressed
in the first three weeks of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the plant will be like, oh,
I need to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And put my generation, perpetuate my
generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pop a pollen sac so I can pollinate
the plant and create seeds so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: reproduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when a harsh environment,
you have a harsh environment, but when you
[SPEAKER_01]: have a nice, good environment where the
plants are thriving and they are super
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy, they don't really have much
reason to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have a reason to hermaphrodite
as if they are stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the main thing with hermaphrodites is
keep your plants as healthy as possible,
[SPEAKER_01]: bug free because bugs can stress the
plants as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Feed them correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't overfeed them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give them a ton of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: The usual mistakes that I see people
doing, it's too much light, too much
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients, keeping the plants too wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you get hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the hermaphrodites can
happen even with a good environment
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's the genetic that cannot be,
sometimes it's not stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what it come about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hermaphrodites happen because the plant
want to produce and procreate and continue
[SPEAKER_01]: her genes in a stress environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't give a reason for the
plant to think that will die and she's all
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving and healthy, she don't really
have a reason to hermaphrodite on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's a way that you can
avoid getting hermaphrodites as if the
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder actually does testing or sends
their seeds out to be tested first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common practice, is people will
take the offspring and then they'll send
[SPEAKER_00]: them out to a group of people,
whether that be five, 10, 15 people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and have them grow it out and see if there
are hermaphrodites or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if everything's all well off of that
batch of seeds that they've gotten tested,
[SPEAKER_00]: then they distribute to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your opinion, how many people should
test the genetics before releasing them to
[SPEAKER_00]: the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all based on how big of the breeding
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have just a small plant,
you cannot send to a thousand people your
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds because you will have no more seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like personally to test my genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I pop all the seeds that I create before I
release them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I germinate them first to see the
germination rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I like to hunt my own seeds and find
my own keepers because that's the main
[SPEAKER_01]: reason I'm breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, to find my own genetics that
I can later on breed with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, first of all, I'm the one to do all
the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the one who does the germination rate
test, and I'm the one who grows the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got a couple of friends that I
trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can give me feedback, and I give them
seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, bro, can you pop those seeds for me
and give me feedback?
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, the number of people that
you give your seeds is based on how big
[SPEAKER_01]: your project is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, I like to be the first
one who tests them, and I have few people,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your yield of seeds is 500,
for example, you don't want to send out 10
[SPEAKER_00]: packs to 20 people, and all of a sudden
there's 200 seeds gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost half of your seeds are gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get what you mean by as far as scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, it's very important who you give
your seeds to because you need to be very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very trustful people that have very good
growing skills because if you give to
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are not have the right growing
skills, they cannot give you the right
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will pop your seeds, and they will
not germinate because they don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: to germinate, or they will harm because
they don't have the right environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I like to keep my circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tight of the people that I trust and give
my seeds to try and get a real feedback
[SPEAKER_01]: from them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the main test that I have right now,
because like I said, I'm not a big
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not considering even myself a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet, it's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the seeds cross my standards,
then they're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: For other people as well, you know,
to send to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I have very high standards,
and I like to try the seeds to grow them
[SPEAKER_01]: myself before I send it to other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, after you've completed that run,
you've harvested the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a common question that people have
because this pollen is still within the
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what do you do for cleaning between
runs to ensure that the pollen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: previous run is completely gone?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I do the same thing with all my grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nothing specific that I'm doing with
the breeding tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got a bottle, not like a spray
bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a container, like a two-gallon
container spray, like an electric spray
[SPEAKER_01]: with battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mix chlorine from Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_01]: With water, and I mix like 10,
20% chlorine and rest water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I spray the whole tent, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spray everything with chlorine,
and then I get my gloves on, and I get the
[SPEAKER_01]: paper towels, and I wipe out everything in
the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, simple and basic cleaning,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've gone through quite a bit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting up towards the end of the
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I could ask towards the
end is, did we miss anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, do you have any advice for
beginners who are just getting started
[SPEAKER_00]: with this process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not afraid to share my whole
experience with everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the breeders in the game,
they try to act like there are secrets
[SPEAKER_01]: that people don't need to know because we
are the only one who we need to make those
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like to be an open book.
[SPEAKER_01]: And help people in the community to make
their own seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I encourage everyone to try to reverse
a plant and create their own seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, with their own genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, the main thing is the
genetic that we breed with and the health
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to touch down a little bit into
the nutrition of the plants into creating
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds because it's a little bit different
than the nutrition of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you create flour for medicine
purposes, you know, for smoking or so on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when I feed my plants for seeds,
I'm not using bloom nutrients as I usually
[SPEAKER_01]: do with my plants that I'm growing for
flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm actually using veg nutrients
because the nitrogen in the veg nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: the high content of nitrogen will help
create and harvest a lot more seeds than
[SPEAKER_01]: if you use a bloom nutrient with a lot of
phosphorus as potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always using veg nutrients,
vegetative nutrients with the high
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I'm using a nitrogen boost
at the end of my
[SPEAKER_01]: plant cycle to match those seeds out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people when they grow for flour,
they use PK boost to boost their flour,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, grow bigger flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you breed, you try to use as much
nitrogen as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you don't want to burn your
plants with nitrogen, but you want to have
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of nitrogen on that, on those plants
so they can create a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a point that I wanted to make for
the new breeders that they start breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: The timing of the reversal and feeding veg
nutrients are very, very important other
[SPEAKER_01]: than genetics that are the most important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for expanding on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is there anything that you have
upcoming in the future that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a lot of things coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying to, like I said, to become a
very well known breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take this breeding stuff all the
way to the top as I did with bodybuilding,
[SPEAKER_01]: no matter how long it will take for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it will take some time,
but I'm very eager to create the best
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds and the best genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world and create as much value for
my customers as possible through my seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working on a lot of projects at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: People can find me on Instagram at Grow
More Stress Less 2.0 because my main
[SPEAKER_01]: account Grow More Stress Less was taken
down by Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I have my breeding account on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Grow More Fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm partnered with my partner in
Miami and we got a hydroponic online
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponic website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called GrowMoreExtreme.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a website where people can find all
their hydroponic needs at very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very convenient prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also focus on very good customer
service and helping people succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't just try to be the next
hydroponic or breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to help people succeed on what they
do because we realize that if we can help
[SPEAKER_01]: people succeed, we are automatically
succeed as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my main goal, help people
succeed, putting a lot of value into my
[SPEAKER_01]: projects that I do with breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: With hydroponics and everything that I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I'm hunting a lot of my seeds trying
to find great genetics in clone form that
[SPEAKER_01]: will bring again a lot of value to my
customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for having me in your
show and I really appreciate the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I know you also have a YouTube
channel and for the folks that are tuning
[SPEAKER_00]: in on YouTube, I'll definitely link that
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also do want to pass off a question to
the audience here listening in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are quite a few people who
create feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to know, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know the way you do it because
there are several different ways that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are always learning and I would like
personally to read all the comments and if
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone has questions for me specifically,
please leave them down below on the
[SPEAKER_01]: comments and I'll come back and I promise
I will answer to everybody questions that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just mention my channel, my YouTube
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow more stress less.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you mentioned me on the comment
so I can come and answer to your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
