[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk, you could take
all of those elements, combine them,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiply that number by five, and you
still have more carbon inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon can turn into hundreds of thousands
of different molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them you can see, others you
can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can detect it as aromatic
and you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really difficult to pinpoint
carbon deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organic farmers have living soils and the
living soil is basically like a giant
[SPEAKER_01]: sponge for carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you feed the soil, you take care of
your microbes and your fungi, and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things like molasses or amino acid
supplementation with plant ferments,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a really good way to supplement the
carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you deliver carbon most
effectively?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is soluble carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do it right, you can actually
far surpass that quality metric you would
[SPEAKER_01]: otherwise assume to get with no CO2
supplementation whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast, this episode

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Nick, Nick Alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, we're going to talk about the
essential element, carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of people think it's just CO2
being added to their environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's it, which is pretty far from
the truth, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much more to it, and Nick's
going to break it down for us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before we get deep into carbon,
what I'd like to do with all the guests is
[SPEAKER_00]: an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've been gardening for a very
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in the Pacific Northwest,
just north of Seattle a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where we have a manufacturing
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even before I got into manufacturing
fertilizers and being so interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon, you know, I come from a family
where my parents kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: forced us to go out in the garden and
spend time outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I learned from an early age quite a bit
about different types of plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: different things that people are growing
as food, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've always been intrigued by it,
you know, the idea that you can grow very
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient-dense food for yourself and you
can kind of provide for yourself and take
[SPEAKER_01]: care of your family and its needs just as
a result of gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would you say your overall
gardening style is?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some people are indoors,
some people are outdoors, some people go
[SPEAKER_00]: after organic or synthetic some people are
in hydroponic systems while others are in
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or even cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style of gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess you could say I prefer a
balance between all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's value to controlled
environment agriculture where you can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: things indoors like mint and, you know,
other crops year-round, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can target specific light
frequencies to kind of generate the
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also find a huge amount of passion
and inspiration behind being a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more connected to nature and just growing
outdoors and kind of being, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in tune with the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that being said,
I also kind of take the same approach to
[SPEAKER_01]: the question of, you know, organic versus
synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there are good ideas that
have come out of synthetic fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that there's some products that
are synthesized that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants respond very well to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're natural in the sense that they're,
you know, biologically available to plants
[SPEAKER_01]: and to microbes and they don't really
cause detrimental effects when used
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing is true of organic agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of great,
great ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's maybe a couple of things that have
been shown to like, if you refine them
[SPEAKER_01]: over time, that they just perform a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, yeah, I think a fair balance of
everything is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into carbon and kind of just
starting with a basic question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is carbon and how is it beneficial
for plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: I always refer to carbon as the forgotten
macronutrient, you know, because when
[SPEAKER_01]: people typically think of plant
fertilizers, what comes to mind is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the NPKs, so nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Calmag fixes everything, cures everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sulfur and other micronutrients
that are responsible in very, very small
[SPEAKER_01]: quantities.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the truth of the matter is you could
take all of those elements, combine them,
[SPEAKER_01]: multiply that number by five, and you
still have more carbon inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants by dry weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: In almost all cases, I think there's
probably very few exceptions with certain
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, like maybe horsetail accumulates a
ton of silicon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have tighter numbers around the
carbon thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, by and large, every plant
that people are familiar with from more
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal and therapeutic plants,
even to food crops, like if we're
[SPEAKER_01]: measuring bricks inside of grapes,
for example, or alpha acids inside of hops
[SPEAKER_01]: that are used to brew beer, all of those
compounds that are being measured and
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by the plants come down to being
mostly carbon by weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon is a very important
macronutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way that most people think about
carbon supplementation is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional or conventional approach
is to find a way to seal off a space and
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce carbon dioxide into the
equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you see this in a greenhouse
type of setting as well, but it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more tricky to do and more difficult
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not really like if you think
about CO2 as just being one molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the hundreds of thousands of
different molecules that plants produce
[SPEAKER_01]: with carbon, it's almost like it doesn't
do it justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a better way to supplement
different types of carbon, different
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors of carbon that are maybe a little
bit more useful to something specific the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon, I think, is a very interesting
macronutrient and an element that a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: growers overlook, partially because it's
really common in complex chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I can give you an example with
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, when most crops are deficient
in nitrogen, one of the first things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you see is a yellow leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this indicates that there's a
problem with chlorophyll biosynthesis in
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you supplement the nitrogen that the
plants are looking for, that chlorophyll
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiency goes away and the green color
comes back to the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and that's kind of a very linear
type of thing to say, well, the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in the fertilizer, whether it's
organic or conventional, you apply it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the crop and you see this color change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carbon can turn into hundreds of thousands
of different molecules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them you can see, others you
can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can detect it as aromatic
and you can smell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really difficult to pinpoint
carbon deficiencies in plants unlike it is
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium and sulfur and nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those will all yellow the leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you only have so many different
reasons as to why it can be deficient in
[SPEAKER_01]: these elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why you're seeing the types of
discoloration on the leaf surface that you
[SPEAKER_01]: might be seeing in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon on the flip side is very
complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that just maybe scares some
people or turns them off from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a very important macronutrient
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is carbon taken by the plant and
how is it metabolized?
[SPEAKER_01]: So carbon is taken in primarily through an
enzyme called rubisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the most abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzyme on planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has one job basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a giant vacuum cleaner that
sucks CO2 out of the air and it smashes it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a sugar, basically a phosphate sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this makes it soluble for the plants
to then take it and move it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because CO2 is not very soluble
in water, unlike sugars are highly soluble
[SPEAKER_01]: in water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like along the lines of if
you have a can of soda and you open it up
[SPEAKER_01]: on a warm summer day, all that CO2 wants
to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you leave your can of soda out for
even 20 or 30 minutes, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: find all that CO2 has escaped.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants have to deal with the same laws
of physics in that the CO2 they're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to capture wants to be released.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wants to kind of go back out because
it's not very soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they do is they have to transform
it chemically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use the energy of the sun to actually
power this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process involves taking CO2 out of the
air and smashing it into a sugar that's
[SPEAKER_01]: then useful as a building block to make
things like new root hairs, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: or specific types of sugar that can feed
microbes in the soil or other compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that can help plants deal with nutrient
deficiencies, as is true with the case of
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants will take that carbon out of the
air and they'll make a very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor of carbon to then inject it into
the soil just outside of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: This compound frees up phosphorus that may
be unavailable to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be there, it just needs a little
bit of chemical transformation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plants use the power of the sun,
take in the carbon, and then squeeze this
[SPEAKER_01]: compound out through the roots to allow
nutrient solubilization and nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it starts off as CO2 in the air by and
large, but then quite literally anything
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything a plant can do is going to
revolve around carbon metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, roots growing through soil is a
function of carbon for sure because carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: makes up the actual what the root hairs
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 80 to 90% roughly, I would say,
you know, dehydrated root mass is
[SPEAKER_01]: predominantly carbon by weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people are supplementing CO2
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want that increased levels of CO2 in
their environment, but that's not the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way to really get carbon in there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some ways to supplement carbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's, you know, carbon-based
fertilizers, generally speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: are relatively new.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, typically we have conventional
or salt-based or synthetic fertilizers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we have something that's more
natural or organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they're plant and animal based.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find things like kelp extracts out
there on the market plus crab shell meal
[SPEAKER_01]: and fish hydrolysates and emulsions,
things of that nature, certainly blood
[SPEAKER_01]: meal, bone meal, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have these two kind of categories
or umbrellas that have been defined for
[SPEAKER_01]: the past at least 100 years, if not
several thousand years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, you know, a lot of the
natural and organic options out there do
[SPEAKER_01]: have carbon inside of them, but there's
sort of new technologies being developed
[SPEAKER_01]: that target carbon specifically,
and those are the carbon-based
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without, you know, getting into
something specific like a carbon-based
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer line, you know, the organic
options might include something like the
[SPEAKER_01]: kelp extract, molasses, any kind of plant
ferment, which I know the KNF guys at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean Natural Farming Community,
they're very heavy into that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens during these reactions is
you get these really soluble forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon that are like powerful
electrolytes, you know, so they can help
[SPEAKER_01]: plants maintain an electrical charge
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really important because
they're taking in energy from the sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, you know, inherently just
electron energy initially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it helps them to, you know,
perform this process of charge balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can get the right kinds of carbon
into them.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 in the air is interesting because it's
just a single carbon atom, just one is in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but it's also fully oxidized,
the O2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as plants go through this process,
it requires energy to break down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you're focused on like good
soil health, good soil chemistry,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you got microbes that you're
supplementing, amino acids, if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing like plant ferments, you're getting
carbon from that for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's gonna help energize the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna get the plants to grow a little
bit more vigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and I don't think, you know,
on the synthetic or the conventional side,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think there's too many options out
there that are carbon-based.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that a lot of the synthetic
fertilizers have just focused on things
[SPEAKER_01]: like, you know, nitrogen and phosphorus
and potassium, sort of at the expense or
[SPEAKER_01]: at the sacrifice of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you're not gonna find, you know,
like a bloom booster is typically just a
[SPEAKER_01]: monopotassium phosphate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have like two elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes some manufacturers will throw in
some sulfur because sulfur can help in the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering stage for certain crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is particularly true of tobacco and
hops and other such, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, there's no carbon as a
macronutrient kind of source there
[SPEAKER_01]: overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like there's more and more people
going towards the carbon-based fertilizers
[SPEAKER_00]: and I hear a lot of great results.
[SPEAKER_00]: From people using them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way to supplement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then kind of the other way you
mentioned was the CO2 in the atmosphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Supplementing CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hone in on that a little bit
more and we'll probably circle background
[SPEAKER_00]: to the carbon-based fertilizers,
but let's talk about supplementing CO2 in
[SPEAKER_00]: the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different ways to go
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I had the TMB Naturals canisters,
those, you know, you shake those up every
[SPEAKER_00]: day, put them in there and they release
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got those CO2 exhale bags,
the mushroom bags that don't actually
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are bringing in tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the different
ways to supplement CO2 and the grow
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most controlled way to do it is to
take in a tank of CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, you just, you know,
make sure that the room that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with is sealed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't off-gas all the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you need the proper
dehumidification load with air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these systems get pretty
expensive, but what it allows people to do
[SPEAKER_01]: is to target to the nearest say part in a
million or a hundred parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CO2 concentration in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes some of these facilities that
do this type of controlled agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll actually have sensors set up to
automatically open and close the valves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they're looking to maintain a
particular range of CO2 saturation in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air, they can do that automatically,
more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some of the other ways to do it,
if, you know, in a more simple approach,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the room isn't perfectly sealed or
you do want a lot of just natural air
[SPEAKER_01]: flow, you know, as is true in the case of,
you know, like high desert areas,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, they may benefit from
structuring their approach a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when you would look at doing
something like either a carbon-based
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer, you know, targeted
specifically for that purpose,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you might do something more natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of organic farmers have living
soils and the living soil is basically
[SPEAKER_01]: like a giant sponge for carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you feed the soil, you take care of
your microbes and your fungi, and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing things like, you know, molasses or
amino acid supplementation with plant
[SPEAKER_01]: ferment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good way to supplement the
carbon into the soil and just have that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of process go naturally because
there's really just two phases of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: as sort of like umbrella categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be the soluble, you know,
liquid form of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got to go in the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the second one would be in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, besides that, there's no other
medium that's really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the air, obviously, like I just
mentioned earlier, presents a little
[SPEAKER_01]: problem because plants need energy to
actually process that form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you take care of it in the
soil, the energy might already be down
[SPEAKER_01]: there just in the form of a microbe or
fungi helping the plants grow a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficiently overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know when supplementing CO2
through the air, there's actually a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good study.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it came out of Utah State
University.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they found that when they supplemented
CO2 up to 1400 ppm, there was a 30%
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty significant increase in biomass
just from supplementing CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, your other aspects need to
be dialed in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, humidity, like VPD,
your EC, all those things need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: dialed in in order for you to increase the
CO2 and see the benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was definitely worthy of
mentioning, but my question in regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be what is the optimal amount
of CO2 in ppm?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of it comes down to it's
you know, think about like a car engine,
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of biomass that your crop may
produce, maybe you measure it in bricks,
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you're growing wine grapes,
for example, that's a frequent measurement
[SPEAKER_01]: or alpha acids and hops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you can do is basically equate that
to like that, that's the horsepower that
[SPEAKER_01]: your motor produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The motor is obviously the plant and
whatever is going on inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in order to get the maximum
productivity or the maximum horsepower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you really have to figure out how to
balance that motor with the proper amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of air and fuel coming in with the right
amount of spark, and then with right,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, sort of exhaust systems and
transmission, all this stuff built around
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants are very similar in that the
spark is actually, the spark of a motor is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the light coming into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the air fuel ratio, you can think
about that, like the air would be your CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration, which was your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the fuel is the stuff that's
coming in from the roots, the water that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're feeding the plant plus all of the,
you know, macronutrients and
[SPEAKER_01]: micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got your balance and dialed in EC,
load.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you notice is that as you crank up
the CO2 and you crank up the light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity, the plants actually need a
little more fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise they're going to become nutrient
deficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue with, well, the slippery slope,
I should say with CO2 supplementation is
[SPEAKER_01]: that if you do it properly, you're
creating a larger demand for nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: uptake for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same is true in a reverse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that, if you're feeding your plants a
higher EC load and that EC is balanced to
[SPEAKER_01]: the spark or the light intensity that's
coming in from your artificial or even
[SPEAKER_01]: natural light, then the plants inherently
want more CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so the optimal CO2, to put it
short, kind of depends on how intense are
[SPEAKER_01]: your lights, how heavy are you feeding
your plants in terms of nutrient strength
[SPEAKER_01]: and composition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Composition is very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the peripheral stuff like
the air conditioning, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: potential and the dehumidification
potential plus what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of medium is somebody growing
in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's really the sort of the
transmission.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of the soils out there may
not be fine tuned for the crops that are
[SPEAKER_01]: being grown inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you lose a portion of the
fertilizer load, for example, or the
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of the water uptake ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you have the right medium for
the right crop under the right light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity and all that stuff, you get the
maximum water uptake, you get maximum
[SPEAKER_01]: transpiration, and that just feeds the
whole system as far as how much carbon can
[SPEAKER_01]: be taken in by the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a high end benefit around 2500
or 3000 PPMs, which is fairly high and
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's a facility that is highly
dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the equivalent of, you know,
2000 PPFD on these plants and they have
[SPEAKER_01]: more dehumidifiers than, you know,
someone would ever in their right mind
[SPEAKER_01]: decide that's the number that I need.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of, you know, through trial
and error and through sort of learning
[SPEAKER_01]: curves, this particular grower managed to
realize like, hey, in this sealed room
[SPEAKER_01]: where I'm pushing these plants with this
much light intensity and this much CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need this much environmental control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as high as 3000, I would say on the
minimum end, if you dial in a good
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon-based fertilizer program,
you actually don't need to supplement CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: at all because the way that CO2
supplementation works is that CO2 delivers
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really what we're talking about is
how do you deliver carbon most
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those is CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is soluble carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you do it right, you can actually
far surpass in my, you know, what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: seen so far, you can kind of far surpass
that quality metric you would otherwise
[SPEAKER_01]: assume to get with no CO2 supplementation
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000 PPM of CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's way beyond anything I've ever heard
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard of up to 2000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I heard actually, if you're in an
environment where there's over 2000,
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000, like it's unsafe to kind of be in
that, be standing there and breathing that
[SPEAKER_00]: in and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get headaches or dizziness or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure there's some safety
precautions that you have to go through
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're trying to supplement that
high, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You definitely feel it after a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not an ideal scenario,
but it's like, you know, a high horsepower
[SPEAKER_01]: motor.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, these are just the tires
spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not necessarily dialed in
for maximum efficiency, but the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: is definitely dialed in to operate at this
very, very high performance level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are notable differences in terms of
decrease in yield and quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this grower drops below 2000 PPMs of
CO2, but part of it is the biomass
[SPEAKER_01]: productivity is so high that of course,
I mean, we're talking about numbers that
[SPEAKER_01]: are far exceed industry standards and what
the average sort of is out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically like if you had the ability
on your hopper, your grape farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, to double the biomass per
square foot, or even in some cases,
[SPEAKER_01]: triple it, that's effectively the
equivalent of what we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that the general guidance would
be if your PPFD is at 1000, your PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: should be at 1000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that's good general guidance
or would you kind of refute that in a way?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this just, it's something that's
so crop specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even within crops, you have different
cultivars of like basil and mint and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have different, you know,
different responses, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some crops are really heavy feeders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find particular cultivars like
that tangerine sage that I was telling you
[SPEAKER_01]: about before the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm growing some tangerine sage
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm finding is it's a small
plant, but it's a pretty heavy feed
[SPEAKER_01]: overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the potency, like it smells just like
tangerine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the craziest plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked by the, when I walked by the
nursery, I smelled the leaves and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just like, dude, I looked at it and I was
like, dude, I have to get this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so pungent and so potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of it is, you know, the crops
respond differently to light intensities
[SPEAKER_01]: and also different concentrations of
fertilizer and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really what is the composition of
that nutrient?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say an even bigger factor is airflow
through and transpiration potential
[SPEAKER_01]: through the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be able to get away with growing
at a lower PPM if you can keep the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: constantly drying out, you know,
in a really dry environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, if you focus on airflow,
you're going to struggle keeping the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: in the soil wet enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some cases, this can actually be an
advantage if you know how to feed and set
[SPEAKER_01]: up the system properly, you know,
but what it also lets you get away with is
[SPEAKER_01]: a lower PPM because you're watering more
often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the plants are kind of going
through that nutrient load more rapidly
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways, whereas other crops, I would say,
you know, there's a lot of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of performance gains that you would
see if you fed pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants actually like to accumulate a
little bit of extra nutrient load outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe in some cases, it kind of helps dial
in the chemistry of what they're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, some plants, for example,
like acidic soils, I think tomatoes are a
[SPEAKER_01]: good example of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of prefer something that drains
well and is slightly acidic, but also has
[SPEAKER_01]: tons of calcium inside of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are kind of like weird things to
have perfectly optimized in nature,
[SPEAKER_01]: but certainly in a controlled environment,
you can achieve these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd say there's a range probably,
give or take about 25%, all things
[SPEAKER_01]: included, plus or minus, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into CO2 monitors a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I hear that CO2 is a heavy
gas and it tends to sink.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if there's any truth in that
or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can say that's bro science or
actual science, but due to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: people say your CO2 monitor shouldn't be
placed like on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people have it placed, you know,
either within the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have it placed at soil level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have it placed on their wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where should the CO2 monitor be placed in
the grow environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it comes down to airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, think about the composition of
air is just like really, really tiny
[SPEAKER_01]: microscopic marbles, you know,
that are just being pushed around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think you got these marbles
floating around in the air, some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: marbles are oxygen, others are CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess if you just let the physics
dictate by gravity, the CO2 has the extra
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course it's going to be a little bit
heavier, but in a lot of these grow rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: that supplement CO2, they have ample
airflow and I don't think that they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the airflow basically is pushing
all these marbles around.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're hitting each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of getting into a flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally you want laminar flow inside of
your grow room, which is like the air is
[SPEAKER_01]: moving as one current.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a bunch of chaotic flow
with these marbles just kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting each other because what that does
is it creates dead spots or it creates
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets of maybe humidity or even worse,
low CO2 concentrations in the grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, if you had good airflow in a
room and it circulated well, both across
[SPEAKER_01]: like the horizontal perimeter of the room
and also if you had a lot of vertical
[SPEAKER_01]: displacement between the ceiling and the
floor, that would sort of homogenize the
[SPEAKER_01]: air overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would do is I would put,
you know, CO2 probe probably at the canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: level overall for an environment like
that, assuming that the airflow is good,
[SPEAKER_01]: because what I want to see off that sensor
is what are my plants detecting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air?
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that I've seen work pretty
well is if you have a sealed space,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got an air handling unit,
that air handling unit on the intake side,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a CO2 sensor sometimes there
because it lets you kind of see what is
[SPEAKER_01]: being pulled in to the ducting because in
the ducting you might have a CO2 valve,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that releases CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a sensor says, hey, I need a little bit
more, the valve automatically opens and
[SPEAKER_01]: dumps the equivalent of, you know,
50 or 100 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a sensor on the back end
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just kind of depends on how complex you
want to go and what the information that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking for is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me personally, I like to see what my
plants are having access to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of makes sense to first make
sure the airflow is really good so
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is really even and equalized
throughout the whole room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then thing number two is to put one at
the canopy and see what the plants have
[SPEAKER_01]: access to, maybe a little bit like one
third of the way down or halfway down the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if somebody's using those CO2 bags,
for example, it's generally recommended to
[SPEAKER_00]: have it over the plants so it'll sink down
onto the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even the TMB Naturals canisters,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're saying as long as there's good
airflow, that shouldn't be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think good airflow is just going to
allow you to take the same concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: of CO2 and spread it equally across the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if CO2 falls,
think about it this way, like the top part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the plant is the one that's growing
most vigorously.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in reality, you want to introduce that
younger growth that's in the presence of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And taking up most of the water from the
roots and transpiring that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the portion of the plant that you
want to introduce to the most CO2 or the
[SPEAKER_01]: most carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you should kind of focus on airflow a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think, you know, the ones that
say, you know, put it above the plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll kind of help via gravity just
naturally get all that CO2 out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once it's in that turbulent stream of
airflow, it's going to get mixed up and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to get distributed to the
plants pretty evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, supplementing CO2, let's say,
hypothetically, they do have a tank and
[SPEAKER_00]: they really have their CO2 levels dialed
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should they supplement CO2 only during
lights on, only during lights off,
[SPEAKER_00]: or both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're growing like cacti in a
desert or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't really find a benefit from
supplementing CO2 at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes, hops, wine grapes, anything like
lettuce, broccoli, spinach, kale,
[SPEAKER_01]: potatoes, all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those like to take in the power of the sun
while the sun is out and then use that to
[SPEAKER_01]: convert the CO2 that's out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cacti and certain other plants will kind
of do this thing at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different, but their
metabolic daytime, quote unquote,
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually when the sun sets because in a
really dry and desiccating environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: the last thing the plants want to do is
open up the pores and allow all the water
[SPEAKER_01]: to transpire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very little to begin with in the
desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they, of course, like to keep their
stomata closed to prevent that water loss
[SPEAKER_01]: during the day, but they still kind of
like solar panels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take in the energy of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They store that in a chemical form and at
nighttime as the sun sets, they open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why a lot of cacti are night
blooming.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce flowers at nighttime.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the best time to supplement CO2 by and
large for most crops is going to be during
[SPEAKER_01]: the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: At nighttime, what I've seen work really
well with certain types of plants is they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually like a little bit of fresh air.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a sealed flowering,
room, what can happen is that depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow environment and how intense the
other parameters are, oftentimes when the
[SPEAKER_01]: lights turn off and the plants go to
sleep, there's a little bit of CO2 that's
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of released.
[SPEAKER_01]: That level may go up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of it is just the room has changed
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights on to lights off changes the
temperature and messes with the humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: and all that stuff in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CO2 kind of revolves around all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I've personally seen is that if
you're in a sealed flowering room and you
[SPEAKER_01]: just do an air exchange at nighttime to
drop the CO2 levels, if you were at 1,500
[SPEAKER_01]: to 1,700 during the day, then going down
to maybe 800 to 1,000, you may actually
[SPEAKER_01]: see a benefit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you're not going to find much,
if any, benefit at all from supplementing
[SPEAKER_01]: at nighttime for the majority of crops out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's get into some of the essential
elements and how it's impacted by carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a lot of knowledge when it
comes to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen some of your presentations that
you have here on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does nitrogen impact carbon intake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, boy, that's a very, very complex
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have a whole episode about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most basic one, the most
obvious one is chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chlorophyll is a pigment that plants use
to capture the energy of the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they like to take that energy and they
like to scrub CO2 out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're deficient in nitrogen,
chlorophyll, you immediately recognize
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, hey, the leaves are yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That chlorophyll decrease means your
plants are taking in way less light
[SPEAKER_01]: energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get as good of a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And subsequently, the biomass and the
yield may also be affected by nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little bit interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always perceive the macronutrients and
the micronutrients just be tools that
[SPEAKER_01]: plants use to capture more carbon or to
store that carbon or to help transform it
[SPEAKER_01]: into any number of different formats.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all just tools like a hammer is
a tool and you've got a chisel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got very specific tools for very
specific jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the job that plants are trying to work
on ultimately is how do I get more carbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, okay, I'm gonna take this
piece of nitrogen and use it as a tool in
[SPEAKER_01]: the form of chlorophyll to power this
process and take light energy and power
[SPEAKER_01]: the process of scrubbing CO2 out of the
air.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is an invisible enzyme,
rubisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most abundant enzyme on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And rubisco, as I mentioned earlier,
just has one job.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sucks CO2 out of the air and it's
powered by chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interestingly enough, that's where the
energy comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're deficient in chlorophyll,
you look at your leaves, they're yellow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also deficient in the thing or
there's not enough power coming to the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that actually takes carbon out of
the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So immediately by default, when you have a
nitrogen deficiency, you're creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon bottleneck inside of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you correct that deficiency,
when you give them more nitrogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: they say, oh great, thanks, I'm gonna turn
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna use these tools to capture more
carbon now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The tools being chlorophyll as a pigment
and then rubisco as an enzyme.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same thing is true of magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium sits at the center of
chlorophyll and it also sits at the center
[SPEAKER_01]: of rubisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're deficient in magnesium,
it's exactly the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're creating a bottleneck in carbon
metabolism in the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't metabolize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens in the case of all of
these deficiencies, it doesn't matter if
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about nitrogen or phosphorus
or potassium or calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter which element we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing that happens is that the
plants stop growing as fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You find that the efficiency of nutrients
is also more stunted growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grow as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grow as fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't grow as robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't gain as much biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not transpiring water as
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting burned more easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: They overall just slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: This slowdown occurs because of the
bottleneck in carbon metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you get all of these bottlenecks out of
the way and the plants can take in as much
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon as possible, whether it's CO2 in a
sealed room or just in the soil chemistry
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really good and healthy and dialed
in, the plants will grow like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing stopping them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use all of the power of the sun in
real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing preventing them from
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got enough nitrogen so they can make
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have enough magnesium so they can
power ribisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have enough phosphorus to make those
phosphate sugars that I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole thing is just this balanced
cycle that keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like this engine that's perfectly
fine-tuned.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes 2,000 horsepower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on to phosphorus, how does
phosphorus impact carbon intake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, phosphorus is required as an
acceptor of CO2 out of the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants work on that CO2 that's
floating around, well, it doesn't really
[SPEAKER_01]: float around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't get too far into that,
but when plants take in that CO2 and they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to convert it into a soluble form,
there's something that has to accept the
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 that's coming out of the air and into
a soluble form.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where phosphorus fits in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a constituent of a sugar that accepts
the CO2 and oftentimes when plants are
[SPEAKER_01]: deficient in phosphorus, that portion
specifically, they lack the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: make those sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really limits the amount of carbon
metabolism that can occur and therefore it
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why phosphorus deficient plants
have really stunted roots, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: not as robust of a root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The architecture of the plant may also
suffer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not nearly the surface area nor the
biomass because the biomass is defined by
[SPEAKER_01]: how much carbon comes into the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a limitation on phosphorus just
like the nitrogen and the magnesium,
[SPEAKER_01]: it creates a bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the nitrogen and magnesium side,
think about it like that's the light
[SPEAKER_01]: energy side and that's the front end where
the plants try to capture the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the light energy has been
supplemented and once the CO2 has been
[SPEAKER_01]: moved into the functional spot for
Rubisco, the catalytic spot, phosphorus is
[SPEAKER_01]: required on the back end.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you have a domino effect of how
the nutrients are required.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it helps to think about it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a little bit of time separation in
terms of what's actually happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Phosphorus required to absorb the CO2 into
the plant from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much good information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure this is going to be an episode
where I just rewatch it and just take
[SPEAKER_00]: notes and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a lot of people tuning in
right now that are taking notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to absorb it all within the
matter of one listen here, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does potassium impact carbon intake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium is like the grand orchestrator
of carbon metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of enzymes that enzymes are
just like tools or like workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take a substrate just like a
woodworker takes a raw block of wood and
[SPEAKER_01]: he may turn it into a beautiful ornate
carving or something more functional like
[SPEAKER_01]: it actually has physical function.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a lock box or a bread box or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enzymes are kind of the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take these raw blocks of substrate,
these building blocks, and they kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: convert them and shape them into a variety
of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of enzymes will act on carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The enzymes associated with sugar
metabolism and with responses to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: stressors, for example, if there's a bug
that's biting into your leaf tissue,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have these switches that they turn on
and off and these switches are mediated by
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have fairly high levels of
potassium in the plant, what you find is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the plants have the ability to turn
on those switches that regulate carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolism.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other interesting ways that
potassium interacts with carbon is that it
[SPEAKER_01]: actually serves to store some carbon,
large pools of carbon that are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like transitionary pools of carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about it like when plants take in
carbon, that carbon doesn't get
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolized and move to its end spot
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: That end spot could be something like the
compounds that are produced inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: hops, those really highly aromatic alpha
acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are an example of what's called a
metabolite.
[SPEAKER_01]: That carbon has been moved down a pathway
and that terminal final step where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: finally all said and done is with the
production of that compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes it could be terpenes like in
tomatoes, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce a lot of terpenes and so do
other crops like lavender, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: produces a lot of terpenes that are all
very therapeutic and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They move carbon from CO2, which is the
origin point, down a very complex and very
[SPEAKER_01]: long line and series of different steps
with enzymes, all of which potassium turns
[SPEAKER_01]: on and says, okay, take this carbon,
do that with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go around and they do a bunch of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terminal metabolites are ones that the
plant's like, okay, I'm done metabolizing
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sink the carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to put it into this form.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more important forms of carbon,
the ones that potassium can directly
[SPEAKER_01]: interact with, are the ones that are in
that transitionary state.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been taken in by the plant,
but they haven't been moved yet all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way through the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: These pools of carbon plants, when they
accumulate them, they actually accumulate
[SPEAKER_01]: energy inside of their systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a lot of potassium,
you can actually sink a lot of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That carbon is specifically in the form of
organic acids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been shown, for example, that as
plants take in the light energy,
[SPEAKER_01]: they power this process of converting
carbon into a soluble form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that carbon is in a soluble form,
it finds its way to potassium ion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are basically neutralized with each
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're highly soluble.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're perfectly balanced in terms of
their charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're functional sources of carbon for
the plant and also more potassium in case
[SPEAKER_01]: one of these enzymes needs an on-off
switch or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting more potassium into your plants
allows you to physically and chemically
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff more carbon inside of your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you have a sealed flowering room
and you've got CO2 supplementation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are deficient in potassium,
it's a much smaller amount of carbon that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can fit into your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may find that the upper limit or the
upper benefit is 500 to 600 ppms of carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're deficient in potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: The moment you get that potassium level
up, let's say you double your potassium to
[SPEAKER_01]: 250 to 300 ppms of potassium, all of a
sudden, the appetite that the plants have
[SPEAKER_01]: for carbon goes way up in the maximum
amount that you can find a benefit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes through the roof because inside of
the plants, the potassium and the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: have to meet and say, okay, this is the
middle neutral state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any excess carbon, because of the
deficiency of potassium, just gets
[SPEAKER_01]: relieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the reason that the CO2
levels at nighttime could rise in a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: is because that charge balance isn't being
maintained, so they release the CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: They physically have no ability to deal
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking about specific ppms of
potassium, for example, or really specific
[SPEAKER_00]: ppms of anything, it's more for hydroponic
systems to where you have a control as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can actually measure out and
precision feed these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what you're mentioning when you
talk about specific ppms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that it's definitely
applicable to the control environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: guys, but I also think that for standard
or conventional agriculture, it makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense to try to think about things in
ratios rather than quantities or amounts,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditional agriculture, I think,
is still rooted in like, okay,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many pounds per acre do we apply and
what are the individual things that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the more advanced approach to
agriculture are now looking at things in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of nutrient composition,
ratios to one another, how many parts in a
[SPEAKER_01]: million do you want as opposed to how many
pounds per acre?
[SPEAKER_01]: This all takes into account the use
efficiency of nutrients plus the use
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency of water, because we're getting
to a spot, globally speaking, where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very important to consider the efficiency
of both of these compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not unlimited supplies of
phosphorus that are easily accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then same thing for freshwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is actually a very valuable resource in
some areas that have to deal with dry
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions or arid conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may not have access to as much water
that they did the year before.
[SPEAKER_01]: All things considered in a global climate
that's constantly changing and actively
[SPEAKER_01]: presenting challenges for farmers,
one of the ways to address those
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges is to be very mindful about how
efficient you're using the water and
[SPEAKER_01]: mindful about how you're using each
nutrient down to the nearest part per
[SPEAKER_01]: million.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's really the best way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does calcium impact carbon intake?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, calcium is a very interesting
element.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps regulate circadian rhythms inside
of plants, sugar metabolism inside of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the most direct pathways is when
the plants take up calcium, they use it as
[SPEAKER_01]: a building block in their cell wall,
just like humans use lime to make
[SPEAKER_01]: structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lime is calcium basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes basically cement inside of the
cell walls of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what they have to do partially is
take an energy from the sun and power that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole carbon fixation process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once the carbon arrives at a
particular state, potassium has turned on
[SPEAKER_01]: a switch to make this enzyme active.
[SPEAKER_01]: This enzyme may be associated with pectic
acid biosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pectic acid is kind of like the glue or
that little, it's almost like the cement
[SPEAKER_01]: of the walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's enzymes that will take calcium
and combine it with pectic acid to make
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium pectate, which is a pretty
important building block for plants in
[SPEAKER_01]: their cell walls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more you can get calcium into the
cell walls of plants, the better overall
[SPEAKER_01]: their ability to resist disease pressures,
to resist changes in the environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: light intensity, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, calcium is required in
very large amounts for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also one of those elements that
if you figure out how to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: metabolized properly and get it to grow
inside of your kale or your broccoli in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, you're going to find that the
nutrient density of those food crops goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through the roof because you have more
calcium inside of there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want more of the calcium to be present
inside of the crop so you can take it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can eat it, and then you get more of a
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the best way to do that for the
plants, at least from the plant's
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, is to have more of those
stored pools of carbon that I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, those ones that haven't quite been
made into the pectic acid that's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get combined with the calcium and then
shoved into a cell wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once it's there, it's a little more
difficult for the plants to break it down
[SPEAKER_01]: and repurpose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually have to spend a lot more
energy than it's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why calcium deficiencies will show
themselves in the newest growth of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant because you need this constant
supply of calcium to be present to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in the transpiration stream in
order for them to be able to take that
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, make the cell walls really thick,
really robust, able to resist light
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity that's maybe a little bit too
much for such young and thin and sensitive
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue and do all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then as the plant continues to grow,
it again needs this constant supply of
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cell walls are a really, really important
function of calcium and carbon metabolism
[SPEAKER_01]: and how the two come together to
ultimately sink both of those into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Calcium is not only a structural element,
but it's also a functional element in the
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that the way calcium works inside of
plants is much like how neurons work
[SPEAKER_01]: inside of the human brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this firing that's going on,
this communication between neurons to help
[SPEAKER_01]: build this picture that the brain has or
this understanding or perception of
[SPEAKER_01]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants are actually, interestingly enough,
very, very similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use calcium in similar ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's these waves that actually get
propagated, these calcium waves that
[SPEAKER_01]: spread information across every cell of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at when plants respond to a
mechanical stressor, let's say you take a
[SPEAKER_01]: pair of garden shears and it's time to
give your plants a haircut or maybe you
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to trim them up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: As soon as you cut the plants,
there's this calcium signaling event that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens within the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this propagation of calcium waves
that fire off each other inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and help spread this message.
[SPEAKER_01]: In certain cases, it could be a localized
response.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's a disease pressure that's
trying to come in, maybe it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: fungal predator that's trying to break in,
those calcium waves will help spread
[SPEAKER_01]: information to the rest of the plant and
make the plant aware that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: danger, there's some kind of threat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole plant responds to what is
actually originating from a very localized
[SPEAKER_01]: place in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very small surface area that
the fungi or that the insect is biting
[SPEAKER_01]: into, but somehow the message gets spread
across the whole plant and the whole plant
[SPEAKER_01]: responds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a function of calcium as not only
structural piece in the cell walls,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also an electrochemical functional
thing like neurons that are in the brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I imagine magnesium, there's some
similarities there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hear about calcium and magnesium being
paired up on things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a lot of differences too,
but can you talk to us about magnesium?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does magnesium impact carbon intake?
[SPEAKER_01]: When plants are taking in the energy of
the light, really what they're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: do is convert that to chemical energy
because the chemical energy is the one
[SPEAKER_01]: that plants use to power all the stuff
that we've been talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorophyll, rubisco, even the phosphate
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: That requires chemical energy for the
plants to recycle all of them like they do
[SPEAKER_01]: with a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just cyclical or even generate
new molecules that are similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: new chlorophyll, new rubisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff requires energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the process of converting light energy
into chemical energy, magnesium is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually the thing that plants rely on in
order to make a molecule called ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: An ATP is a very high energy molecule that
is ultimately created when plants
[SPEAKER_01]: facilitate this process of converting
sunlight energy into chemical energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That chemical energy is actually ATP in
part.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other molecules, but ATP is like
the really, really valuable one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very high energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it turns out that it's not ATP
actually like a lot of people have heard
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe assume it to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually magnesium ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnesium is the carrier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the chelating agent for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps bind up the ATP and allow it to
be transported to where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a deficiency in magnesium,
you have this bottleneck in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP that can be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like having US dollars versus having
ounces of gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather take the ounces of
gold.
[SPEAKER_01]: The value difference is quite dramatic
between more basic forms of chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: currency or chemical energy for the plants
and really the holy grail, which is ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at all of these energy
producing systems inside of biological
[SPEAKER_01]: systems, like humans, for example,
we breathe in oxygen and that drives
[SPEAKER_01]: what's called oxidative phosphorylation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make ATP using the power of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also break down matter that plants
produce, but plants also similarly take in
[SPEAKER_01]: energy from the light and they use that to
make ATP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Universally across all species,
it doesn't matter if you're a plant or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a human, ATP for your entire
biological system is one of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable, if not the most valuable,
energy currency there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a deficiency in magnesium
ultimately means you have a deficiency in
[SPEAKER_01]: ATP because it's magnesium ATP that is
actually the energetic molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just ATP.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information there.
[SPEAKER_00]: While we don't have time to go over every
single essential element and how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted by carbon intake, maybe we'll
save that for a part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the audience demands it, yeah,
we could probably get him on for a part
[SPEAKER_00]: two in the future, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that'd be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of things that you talked about
for clarification purposes is
[SPEAKER_00]: biochemistry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm myself, I'm just learning regular
chemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that chemistry is kind of a
prerequisite?
[SPEAKER_00]: You should learn that first before
biochemistry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also, do you have any other
resources like people who want to learn
[SPEAKER_00]: more about biochemistry, where they should
go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, from my perspective,
I think the best way to learn is to,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a very simple process, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just read something about plants that is
interesting for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I prefer to go to the Journal of
Experimental Botany than Oxford has
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's always good topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look back through the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a number of different topics
that they've covered.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing about the learning process
with this stuff is it gets really complex
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's oftentimes a lot of wormholes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's even lingo sometimes that
doesn't make sense, like reduction in
[SPEAKER_01]: oxidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very confusing for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it really depends on how you frame
your interest and what your passion is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I find that this is easy to do if you
go and read just one paper a day and find
[SPEAKER_01]: one topic that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you're curious about how plants turn
sugars into things like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: terrapins inside of lavender.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that wonderful fragrance get
produced by the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, read a paper about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then ask at least one question that
arose when you read that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask one question to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would I want to learn more about?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was confusing or what didn't make
sense?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you just go through that same
process over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll eventually get to a spot where you
have a much deeper understanding of plant
[SPEAKER_01]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only the chemistry of it all,
but also the biochemistry, the organic
[SPEAKER_01]: chemistry, carbon chemistry side
associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's really the Pandora's box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you open that up, the inside is now
the outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can no longer close it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I definitely appreciate you coming
onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to rewatch this and let
this absorb into my brain a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more because lots of things that I didn't
know that you covered in this episode.

all this type of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really just a passion of
mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as future plans, we're working
on a couple of really cool things right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The focus has been on just getting the
carbon based fertilizer line that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing, kind of getting it out
there to more folks to have them give it a
[SPEAKER_01]: try.
[SPEAKER_01]: And use it and see some of the benefits
and just hear some of the positive
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback that people have as a result of
using it.
