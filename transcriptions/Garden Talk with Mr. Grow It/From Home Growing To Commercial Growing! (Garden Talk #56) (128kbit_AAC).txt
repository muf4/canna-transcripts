[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stable businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for people with actual
experience and education at a collegiate
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you have full control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of make your standard
operating procedures to match your time
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have, you know, 20, 30,
50 lights in a room, it makes a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference compared to two lights in a
Home Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wet trimmed product looks really great for
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like to take pictures of it to
show off for your Instagram, wet trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of a fun way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In horticulture, there's usually more than
one way to get to your end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different methodologies
to grow your end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because you're good at doing it
one way in your Home Grow does not mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you can come into someone else's
horticulture facility and change what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel that don't know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode number 56.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Envy Closet
Med Grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 10 years and he
grows a variety of plants such as
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes, peppers, cacti, medicinal
varieties, houseplants, and more.
[SPEAKER_01]: He started as a home grower and then
worked his way up into working in
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to get into
today from home growing to commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: growing.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Envy Closet
Bedgrower.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing great, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to have some topics to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's a blessing to be on here
talking with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm ready to get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been friends for several years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were on my Twitch live stream not too
long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a really great conversation
about a bunch of different topics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I figured it would be good to have you
on here, Garden Talk, so we can speak
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically about gardening, you know,
one of your specialties for sure.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I want to get into on this episode
is home growing to commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many people out there that
are home growers right now that their
[SPEAKER_01]: dream is to eventually work in a
commercial facility, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whether they live in a legal
state and there are already facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: open and they want to get their foot in
the door there, or maybe they're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-legal state that's going to turn to be
legal and they want to be all prepared and
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go for when it does become legal
so they can get into the industry on that
[SPEAKER_01]: avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gone from home growing to
commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought you'd be a great person to
have on the show today.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, you are the one that came
up with the topic for this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So props to you for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, you know, some of my background,
I started off more or less as a home
[SPEAKER_00]: grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won multiple cups home growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I really care and try to
stay with the home growing community as it
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to obviously many different plants
and gardening, but particularly hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did a lot of that for many years and
then I've also managed facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've managed, you know, both facilities
and I've helped consult for different
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my next project actually is a large
hemp grow in Tennessee that is all
[SPEAKER_00]: complete indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Managed commercial projects, as well as
home grow projects at a very high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, I think it would be a good
topic we could get into and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the differences between how you
would manage a home grow and how you would
[SPEAKER_00]: either be an employee and or manage a
commercial grow and what things you need
[SPEAKER_00]: to look for in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get too deep into it though,
you gave us a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_01]: introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you do a full blown introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things to be said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But tell us a little bit about yourself
and kind of how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got into gardening when I was
young in vegetable gardening anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom always liked to have a vegetable
garden out back of our house in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I got older, I got more into hemp for
medical plant production and did a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I was younger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I went eventually moved to Nevada,
which was a legal state for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and got into home growing with a
license to home grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually, I won multiple different cup
awards and progressed my YouTube channel
[SPEAKER_00]: for home growing with tents and closets
and various things along those lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from there, I progressed into helping
manage growth stores and horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've sold a lot of horticulture
equipment, made a lot of deals and
[SPEAKER_00]: contacts with various different
horticulture companies and progressed from
[SPEAKER_00]: there to actually managing horticulture
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So live in the dream, live in a lot of
people's dreams, which is working in that
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, you know, kind of taking a step
back and talking about qualifications,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not anybody can just walk in off the
street and apply to some of these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have qualifications,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to begin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what qualifications should folks have
before applying to a commercial facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it honestly all depends on what
you're trying to get into some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: entry level positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really don't need a whole lot of
qualifications if you just want to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: basic trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, a lot of times they will
hire you on with absolutely zero
[SPEAKER_00]: experience because it's kind of tedious
work and it's entry level to get you in
[SPEAKER_00]: the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other entry level positions might be like
a basic garden helper where you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: going through and plucking leaves and
doing that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you're not usually in charge of
any watering or in charge of too much as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as, you know, the irrigation or
fertigation of your crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those, again, you can get in
with just basic cultivation knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: basic plant knowledge, a good work history
in other fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, no matter what you're getting
hired for, someone's going to want to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you show up to work on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're credible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get along with your employees,
you know, all those things that are that
[SPEAKER_00]: are general amongst any job field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more or less how you get into
it a lot for the entry level positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have as much to do with having
a ton of experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with being a good employer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with being a good employee
that they're able to train to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: function they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as you get up from there,
there's also a lot of mid-level jobs,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like specialty horticulture jobs
like a propagator or a room supervisor and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those type of jobs, usually you want to
have some little more advanced knowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: of horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also going to want usually one or
two years experience either as a mid or
[SPEAKER_00]: entry level employee already in these type
of facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way they know you have some
experience in what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you get to that point,
it's important that you at least have some
[SPEAKER_00]: employee management experience,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're managing a room and have
employees underneath you, they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure you're you're a good fit to deal
with other employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that is more HR related and a
lot less horticulture related stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you got to have those skills in order
to progress into higher level positions
[SPEAKER_00]: within these horticulture facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Progressing up from that, you can get jobs
like lead cultivator and lead grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: master grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes by various different names
depending on the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times in those, they really
do ask that you have five plus years
[SPEAKER_00]: experience within a horticulture facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also by this point should have some
secondary school or college experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture, agriculture or botany
somewhere within a related field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know you're also classically
trained with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how plants work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's that's usually pretty important
by the time you get to that that higher
[SPEAKER_00]: end of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, you're going to need
multiple years of employee management at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point, you know, because you're going
to have teams underneath you, not only
[SPEAKER_00]: just employees, but also supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to take care of your entire
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, once you the higher you go up
in these ranks, employee management
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes very important as well as
obviously as a lead cultivator,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need both advanced to expert level
experience and knowledge in horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the the last kind of section I
got here is support jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the larger cultivation facilities
don't only have cultivation based jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a front desk slash intake
clerks a lot of times that help,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, take the phone calls for the
facilities, take in the orders that that
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivator orders in for supplies and,
you know, various different things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's commercial sales managers,
which are another more high end job where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually in charge of selling the
products that you're those business
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, there's also data
specialists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes there's like in the medical
field, there's metric system in many
[SPEAKER_00]: different states that's required.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need a data track of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they usually work very close along
with the commercial cultivator in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure everything stays on track and
everything is up to regulation based on
[SPEAKER_00]: the state you're in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and those jobs can vary on what you
need to get into those positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, you know, front desk
clerk, you usually need other front desk
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be a data specialist
that kind of wants you to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge of metric and some knowledge of
how horticulture facilities run,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're a commercial sales
manager, you're going to want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple years experience and possibly
degrees in sales and working for different
[SPEAKER_00]: sales because it's a higher end position
that usually pays well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that's kind of the four
different facility, your entry level,
[SPEAKER_00]: mid level, your lead jobs, you know,
production managers and such, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: your support.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lots of different areas that you can
kind of get into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, generally speaking, a lot of
folks think that master grower is kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: the end goal and running a facility,
you know, kind of on the floor,
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with the plants directly is one of
the main options that I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people go for.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, definitely starting out from the
bottom and kind of working way up into one
[SPEAKER_01]: of those positions is certainly a
possibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I feel like going right into one of
those high level positions that you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned, having an education,
you know, they're going to look for that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want they want you to have some sort
of bachelor's degree or doctor degree or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that relates specifically to
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to interrupt,
but yes, you are 100 percent right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's mainly the change in the job
market over the last 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a lot of states have gotten medical
programs and become more open to growing
[SPEAKER_00]: medical plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've they used to take on cultivating
cultivators from, say, the black market
[SPEAKER_00]: that just knew what they were doing as
things progress more into more into stable
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for people with actual
experience and education at a collegiate
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back in 2016 when this state
just went record in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were in there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they just started bringing on
dispensaries, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dispensaries just launched in 2016 and
cultivation facilities were just opening
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I applied back then because that's
something I wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was so I couldn't even get a
response back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was like the market was
flooded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I was told by insiders is that
you have to know somebody in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: really get your your resume pushed up to
the people who are doing the hiring aspect
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be difficult to find those
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so, you know, I ended up
eventually giving up and just just
[SPEAKER_01]: continue on my home growing and doing the
media side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how would you recommend folks actually
go about applying?
[SPEAKER_01]: To these commercial facilities so they
don't run into these dead ends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, like you said, it's it's a or like
we were briefly talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of a different setup now than it
was five to ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five to ten years ago, you very much had
to know someone, have the in get your name
[SPEAKER_00]: in someone's ear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, it's run a lot more like most
corporate businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you can fill out online
applications for different positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't find an easy way to apply for
a facility that's near you and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's there, you know, go look at their
website, go look at their social medias
[SPEAKER_00]: and ask them how you can how you can apply
for these positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to be outgoing with the fact that you
do want to work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, sometimes sometimes it
can be hard to find these particular
[SPEAKER_00]: places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have to directly go out and
search, you know, for for their direct
[SPEAKER_00]: websites.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not always on Indeed or some of
these bigger job engines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, sometimes they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a larger commercial
operations nowadays, and they do very much
[SPEAKER_00]: many of them post indeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all depends on the facility you're
looking looking towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on on how they're doing their
hiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times nowadays, this day and
age, you can find online applications or
[SPEAKER_00]: or websites linking to these different
horticulture companies that you can then
[SPEAKER_00]: apply for.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the home growing versus
commercial growing side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to go through some of the
individual processes or different stages
[SPEAKER_01]: of growth and kind of what home growing
entails versus what being in a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility entails.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's be honest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Home growing is a small side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those processes that are done just
aren't able to be scaled up to a large
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's some some big
differences throughout growing from from
[SPEAKER_01]: home to commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've worked in the facilities
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can definitely give us some insight
on the differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with just, you know,
starting from the beginning, propagation
[SPEAKER_01]: and seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: What differences would you say would take
place between home growing and commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: growing when it comes to propagation and
seedlings?
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, we'll start on the home
growing side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, you have full control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's done by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of make your your standard
operating procedures to match your time
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like you said, it's you have a lot
more availability to pop seeds on a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: level when you're working on a commercial
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want the consistency of having
consistent crops and consistent output of
[SPEAKER_00]: your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by popping seeds and having different
variables that may, in the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: cost your company money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So or cost your company in less revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's kind of looked at the same
in the economic world.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not maximizing your revenue,
you're losing money when you look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: from an economics point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times in facilities,
you have much less variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, when it gets to cloning,
sometimes you use slightly different
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, because let's face it,
if you have two lights or less,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not usually going to need a full
tray of 50 clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times as a home grower,
I'd get inch and a half pre-wrapped
[SPEAKER_00]: rockwool blocks, break off what I need and
clone six or 10 or 12 plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a commercial facility,
chances are you're going to need hundreds,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not thousands of plants for your next
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything's done on rockwool sheets in
a commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a 10-20 tray for the most part,
or you know, it's done a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently over a larger scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not made to match your size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made to match what you need going
next in the production line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, a lot of times I'll use like
inch and a half or two inch, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 cell rockwool sheets in a 10-20 tray as
compared to the individual wrapped cubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: because then I can just clone in groups of
50.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I need a thousand clones,
I might clone, you know, 1050 clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: then take the best thousand and run those
for my next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: As compared to at a home grow,
if I need 12 clones, I'm not going to use
[SPEAKER_00]: a rockwool sheet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to just take those individual
clones and take what I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the actual procedure can
slightly change and some of the equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: can slightly change.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then on top of that, also propagation
in a facility is usually done in a
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation room or in the mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're able to maintain higher
humidities throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times in home grows, people just
don't invest in their propagation area the
[SPEAKER_00]: same they would in their flower area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's usually, you know, an extra closet
space or I got an extra light over here in
[SPEAKER_00]: the corner of my room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to spray your clones a lot
more to keep the humidity up on them if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a dry area and that sort of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a facility, your humidity is on
point because you have bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, there's a little less
of the spraying of the clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little more consistent procedure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get deeper into the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you mentioned that, you know,
temperature, relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, airflow, air exchange, all of those
things are going to be somewhat similar,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there's a lot of differences in how
they're controlled from home growing
[SPEAKER_01]: versus commercial growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you know, a dehumidifier is
going to be a lot smaller in a home grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and say a bedroom, for example,
with a couple of tents, it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot smaller than it would be in a
commercial facility where they have this
[SPEAKER_01]: massive room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I imagine the equipment to be
a lot bigger, maybe multiple pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment controlling things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk just about environment
differences between home growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, of course, like you said,
there's definitely going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistencies based on the size of the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of your parameters are still
going to, you're going to try to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters somewhat the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when you have that larger
equipment and you have a better sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: position in a facility, you have less
variation in what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be more consistent both with
your temperatures, humidities,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also with home grows many, many times,
you're not running CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you guys are, but the
majority of home growers aren't running
[SPEAKER_00]: excessive CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're cycling air from their room
out of their room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for instance, with tent grows,
you condition the room and then cycle air
[SPEAKER_00]: through the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a facility, it's more about
conditioning your grow space and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure it's consistent throughout the entire
grow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a lot bigger equipment,
usually almost always CO2 injected on a
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't been in indoor facilities
without CO2 because it is that much of a
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit to your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as a home grower, a tent grower,
it's really hard to get those elevated
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can sometimes lead to you needing
slightly less light, running slightly less
[SPEAKER_00]: or less strength fertilizer, lower EC
fertilizer, because you don't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon to increase that photosynthetic
rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a facility, with the CO2,
you would run things a little more to the
[SPEAKER_00]: max to try to get your max production out
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial air handlers have HEPA
filtration and things built into them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can help clean the air column of
molds and mildews and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a lot of home grow ACs,
you know, the dual ducted ACs and window
[SPEAKER_00]: ACs and even small mini splits,
you're not going to have that type of
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's about controlling those variables
on a larger scale to make sure you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any loss of production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas on a small scale, it's about doing
things that fit around your lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, you know, sometimes have to work
around work schedules and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can change when you're timing
your lights of the day and all sorts of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your environment can be a lot more
variable in a home grow, I find,
[SPEAKER_00]: than commercial, because there's money
riding on the commercial, not just your
[SPEAKER_00]: personal, but there's money riding for
investors that do not take no returns as
[SPEAKER_00]: an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything has to be considered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistent and run to the facility's SOP
when it comes into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, cleanliness can be slightly
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's times when be a little
lazy in my home grows, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like back to propagation, I might cut
clones with the same scissors on all four
[SPEAKER_00]: of my strains in my home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a large commercial facility
and you're cutting thousands of clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: you better keep some alcohol near you to
keep those scissors clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to be transferring any
contaminant that might be on one plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can make a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, those are the type of
environmental differences between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the last thing is in
commercial, you're not wasting space on
[SPEAKER_00]: conditioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like I said with tent grows where
you condition a room, then cycle it
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, if you're conditioning a room,
you better have plants in that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of your biggest expenses
outside of labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you better make sure you're pushing it
as best as you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely some good call-outs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Significant differences when it comes to
home growing versus commercial facility
[SPEAKER_01]: for those reasons you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine any commercial facilities
using those TMA Naturals canisters,
[SPEAKER_01]: shaking them up and putting them all
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your production cost per unit would be
through the roof if you're using a yeast
[SPEAKER_00]: and sugar based CO2 release.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, there's another difference for
you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of home grows that do run CO2 are
usually 50 pound bottles of CO2 and that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you scale up into a commercial
facility, that's 5,000 square foot or
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they switch over to liquid
CO2 tanks and then inject in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have, you know, large 500
gallon liquid CO2 tanks, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: or compressed CO2 tanks that hold a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's piped in through your whole
facility instead of being a bottle in a
[SPEAKER_00]: corner being released through a regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, you know, quite, like you
said, quite a bit of differences on
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and both their size,
scale and capabilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask about the CO2 change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you got into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, airflow and air exchange is also kind
of the important piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of touched on that a little bit on a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked about air exchange,
you know, having a tent versus grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have fans of the commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are fans all around the facility,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the air exchange is another thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Having air being exhausted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I believe, correct me if I'm
wrong, from multiple areas, not just one
[SPEAKER_01]: area being exhausted from.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do typically they go about,
you know, airflow and air exchange in a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial facility?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of times air exchange is
actually less than a non-CO2 home grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're trying to maintain keeping
the CO2 in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, based on some regulations,
at least I know for a fact it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada, you need to have a CO2 purge just
in case something breaks and it gets above
[SPEAKER_00]: certain levels, it'll automatically pump
the CO2 out of your room as a safety
[SPEAKER_00]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something you would never have on a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would just look at your monitor when
you walk in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the number's too high, turn off your
CO2 and get the hell out, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a facility, you need to have
these regulations in place to protect your
[SPEAKER_00]: employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times you have, you know,
CO2 purging units, which could be a fan on
[SPEAKER_00]: a CO2 controller to where if it gets above
say five or 10,000 PPMs, whatever your
[SPEAKER_00]: state regulation is, it'll automatically
dump all air out of your room from within
[SPEAKER_00]: two feet of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way it will pull all the heavier
CO2 from the bottom of the room out and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything will start to in there and
maintenance your equipment to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with the home grow,
that's not something you would have going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also in the commercial facility,
like I said, you'd have less air exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: so you're not wasting your CO2 for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some facilities set up to do a
night dump where they dump all the air out
[SPEAKER_00]: of their environment at night,
replace it at night, and then when the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights kick back on, they'll re-release
more CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as for CO2 efficiency and cost
efficiency, that's usually not the best
[SPEAKER_00]: way to do it in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would keep it more or less not dumping
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a little bit more oxygen
exchange just from employees coming in and
[SPEAKER_00]: out the doors and then maintain as much
CO2 in the room as possible with it sealed
[SPEAKER_00]: and less exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now air flow, which is the second thing
you had kind of brought up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: is also a little different in a facility
because when you have such big rooms,
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to make sure the temperature in
this corner of the room, this corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: the room, the middle of the room,
the front is consistent within a degree or
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're going to have very
inconsistent canopies, growth situations,
[SPEAKER_00]: and possibly chances for contamination if
you've got pockets of humidity and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, again, a lot bigger equipment
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company called Schaeffer that
makes fans that can launch air in quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: distance that's really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other fan technologies that
actually mount on the ceiling and pull air
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cycle it through the room and that'll
really help with your consistency of
[SPEAKER_00]: making evenly dispersed amongst your room.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have, you know, 20, 30,
50 lights in a room, it makes a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference compared to two lights in a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So definitely some, some major differences
there for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the vegetative stage for a
little bit here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of things that home growers do that
really aren't done in the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: facility side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, maybe we should start with kind
of watering and feeding, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're dealing with hundreds,
thousands of plants, I don't think a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of commercial facilities do hand watering,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're on some sort of automated machine
fertilizer, you know, a Dosatron or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked to us about the differences
between, you know, fertilizing and
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is quite a few different
companies that, uh, that deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: different fertigation and irrigation
equipment, but on a home growth scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not worth buying this equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like you said, Dosatron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some Dosatrons can be a couple thousand
dollars just for a single peristallic pump
[SPEAKER_00]: and a controller, you know, and if you
have a two light home grow, it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily worth your investment to throw
in that much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or say like an Argus fertigation system
can cost 30, $50,000 or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have touch screen controls for all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to need that at a home
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just never going to get your,
your value back from buying a 50 piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a facility that's 10,000 square
foot or more, they can probably get their
[SPEAKER_00]: money back on that $50,000 investment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times home grows, um,
there's a lot of hand watering majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time in veg in order to get things to
size, just because it's, it's also harder
[SPEAKER_00]: to put in irrigation when you're trying to
cycle things on a smaller level.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got two plants that are young in
veg, two plants that are old in veg,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to be drinking completely
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost easier to hand water at
that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have five hundred plants on
these five rows and 500 plants on these
[SPEAKER_00]: five rows, you can set up fertigation
equipment to feed those 500 how you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: feed those 500 how you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up with, uh, not a more
consistent, but a more, more efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: plan of feeding both in labor costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got to remember commercial
facilities, one of your highest costs is
[SPEAKER_00]: labor costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're hand watering, you're going to
need twice as many employees as if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using irrigation equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is a huge difference in the
vegetative section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another big difference is the amount of
experimentation you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned earlier, as a home
grower, you can pop different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a lot of different things to
excite yourself about your horticulture
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in a facility, you need to
follow the SLPs, whatever the lead grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, who's ever in charge of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up those SLPs for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They know what they're doing most of the
time, most of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they, uh, on top of that, they,
they set it up in a way so that way it
[SPEAKER_00]: works for their production techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when in horticulture, there's usually
more than one way to get to your end
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different methodologies
to grow your end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just because you're good at doing it
one way in your home grow does not mean
[SPEAKER_00]: you can come into someone else's
horticulture facility and change what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could very much change the outcome
and the time schedules of what they have
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a very big no-no.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you get into, uh, uh, facilities,
again, you're using larger irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is a key there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to consistently grow well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoa, my camera's getting fuzzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, you, uh, consistently want to
stay to these schedules because you're on
[SPEAKER_00]: very strict time schedules on when you
need these plants ready for their next
[SPEAKER_00]: stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas at a home grower, if you want to
let it grow a little week longer and let
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant and flower finish a week later,
you can kind of get away with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to do that in a commercial
facility, that week could be thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars worth of production cost for no
harvest now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem to the investors and the money
people that are paying your salary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's kind of the differences
in the vegetative system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, your time schedule is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing what's needed to get these
plants to the next stage based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're usually involved involving
irrigation systems as compared to hand
[SPEAKER_00]: watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you scale up to larger size
facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine plant training, which is often
done in the vegetative stage is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be a lot different too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned labor, how labor can be
significantly more when it comes to hand
[SPEAKER_01]: watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you're in a cultivation facility
and you want people to do defoliation or
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipopping or, you know, low stress
training or any type of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: these hands-on training techniques,
it's going to be more labor cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine that they cut back a little
bit there compared to what home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing to their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about the differences with
plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, uh, with that respect,
some of that plant training is still done
[SPEAKER_00]: cause it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of defoliation and lollipop is still
done on a commercial scale because you
[SPEAKER_00]: need that airflow for your IPM prevention
to help prevent mold growth and mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: growth and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of those techniques are still
used and that's just a labor cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, management's going to have to
endure, but you're also right about the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that there's a lot less LST,
there's a lot less topping because,
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is a regulation issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most home grows for medical plants anyways
are regulated to how many plants they can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you need X amount of product out of
your medical plant, but you're only
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed six flowering plants, you might
want a much bigger plant that takes more
[SPEAKER_00]: topping and training and LST and a much
longer veg time in order to get your
[SPEAKER_00]: desired result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a facility, we're really trying
to minimize the amount of veg time we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and if we need to fill more plant canopy
space, we will add more plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually less labor costs to put
more plants per area than it is to grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: much bigger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have another episode that was,
that was very good about why you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller plants from a year or so ago on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of your more popular episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys should check that one out too,
when you're done with this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, that's, that's very much
why the production cost and the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations on home growers lead home
growers to grow larger plants in most
[SPEAKER_00]: areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, whereas commercially we fill it with
more plants that are in the same size root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone, same consistent size canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way we can match it to our
irrigation systems and all our inputs and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything grows evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think that's all the notes I
have on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's the main difference is
those regulation differences and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fact that home growers sometimes
need to grow larger plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touched upon IPM and I want to circle
back around to that and get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper into IPM because it's a much larger
scale with commercial facilities compared
[SPEAKER_01]: to home grow, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a typical home grower is going to,
oftentimes just use a small 40 ounce hand
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayer and spray their plants,
you know, with that, or use a Chapin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the two gallon Chapin or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have some of those myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're on the commercial facility
side of things, when you're dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: more plants, you know, 50, a hundred
plants, thousands of plants, often see
[SPEAKER_01]: people go to like the backpack style ones,
which spray further, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a mist compared to some of these
hand sprayers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked to us about the differences
with, you know, IPM and spraying and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you said, you briefly touched on
it as with everything else, your equipment
[SPEAKER_00]: scales up with the size of your girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, even if you look at a
horticulture perspective from say large
[SPEAKER_00]: scale greenhouses, production greenhouses
for cut flowers and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have giant booms that go through
their whole greenhouse and can further
[SPEAKER_00]: gate and or spray pesticides just to cover
that much area without needing the labor
[SPEAKER_00]: costs involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at small to mid scale commercial
facilities, like you said, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using a five gallon backpack
sprayer because otherwise if you're mixing
[SPEAKER_00]: up a gallon, half gallon at a time,
you're going to be mixing all day and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to spray as compared to getting
your work done and continuing on to the
[SPEAKER_00]: next path.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I need to mention with
that is as a home grower, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: limited in what you can use as long as
you're growing safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using things that are not
carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using things that have low toxicity
and low half life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can break down quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pretty much open to use whatever
you want on your home garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the regulations for facilities are
twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are agriculture regulations for pest
management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pest application in almost every state
and federally that you have to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of your IPM specialists inside
your facilities will actually need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by the state and they'll
actually have to take classes and be
[SPEAKER_00]: certified in order to apply pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, within the medical plant
market, there's also direct regulations by
[SPEAKER_00]: those states that have legalized the
medical plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost every legal state has their own
set of regulations on which pesticides you
[SPEAKER_00]: can use, which pesticides you cannot use.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for instance, there's a strong,
it's fairly toxic pesticide for killing
[SPEAKER_00]: water molds called metalaxel.
[SPEAKER_00]: In almost every medical state,
you cannot use that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Nevada, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a long half life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's toxic, but it's not carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other states, you can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you use it based on what
the label says, so that way you're
[SPEAKER_00]: following the federal regulations,
then you can use it in a facility in
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use that same product on a facility in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to know your state by state
regulations, as well as your federal
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations on who can apply pesticides
and what type of certifications they need
[SPEAKER_00]: before they are allowed to do that
legally.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got to have a lot of knowledge in
regards to that, because I'm sure it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty muddy going from state to state.
[SPEAKER_01]: The impact can be astronomical,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're spraying the wrong thing on
there, you send that crop over for
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, all of a sudden it fails tests
and your entire crop is wiped out and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't put that product on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going to have some very
mad investors, very, very mad investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times you, if you lose more than
2% of your crop throughout the year,
[SPEAKER_00]: your investors are not going to be too
happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you break the 5% mark failure rate,
they're probably looking for a different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot in the line for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the differences between
home growing and commercial growing within
[SPEAKER_01]: the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Briefly, this one is kind of repetitive of
some of the other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you need to make, as a home grower,
you make a cultivation plan that works for
[SPEAKER_00]: your schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of other times you have a job,
you have other things going on in your
[SPEAKER_00]: life, you have a family, you need to
maintain that schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large facility, on the other hand,
might just run two or three shifts of
[SPEAKER_00]: employees and it's not about, oh,
the lights have to be on now because I can
[SPEAKER_00]: work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, we set up the lights based on what's
most efficient for our facility and the
[SPEAKER_00]: employees work around that schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little backwards to those
regards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, in a home grow, a lot of times you
can run your plants as long as you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to finish to senescence the way
you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cultivation facility, timing is
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are running a nine week flower
room, when it's day 63, you are
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting, whether that plant needs two
or three more days or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way it is because within a
day or two, you have veg plants that have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be in that location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you over-veg your veg plants,
now they're sitting longer in veg and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a waste of resources and money
spent in the previous cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, timing is everything
commercially.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you can kind of work things around
a little bit to your liking and to your
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule as a home grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then secondly, consistency,
consistency, consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow the standard operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lead growers are put there for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have, again, like I said earlier,
if you need to follow the procedure,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's many different ways to grow a
healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a set up plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were put in there for a reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're a mid to entry level
employee, just follow what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you have a different idea on how
to do it, bring that up in a question form
[SPEAKER_00]: to the lead grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring that up later, but do the work they
tell you to at that time, even if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: inconsistent with your own knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's so much on the line for sure
throughout the entire grow, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it makes me wonder, you had
mentioned being on a set schedule and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they're harvesting flowers, even when they
might not, they might need a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more time, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine how many facilities are
harvesting early to where like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: potency is an at its full potential and
potentially, you know, clear trichomes,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, where it's, you know,
the effect doesn't last as long or it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: different effect than what that cultivar
truly brings out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to work around that, a lot of times
the facilities work plants that match
[SPEAKER_00]: their facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a plant that needs 10 weeks to
flower and it seems to grow in someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else's facility, great, but in your
facility seems a little bit slowed down
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have a nine week or eight week
flower schedule, you're cutting that plan
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the lineup after one run of it and
switching to something that grows properly
[SPEAKER_00]: in your environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a home grower, like I said,
you might just give it the extra week
[SPEAKER_00]: because you like that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not doing that on a commercial
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about making sure those ends meet for
your investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to make those tough decisions
that are a little bit tougher in this
[SPEAKER_00]: regard in a cultivation facility than what
they would be as a home grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, harvesting, getting a little bit
deeper into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned that they're on a strict
schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to do it at a certain time,
but how about like physical process of
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: It varies quite a bit from home grow to
commercial facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak on that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as a home grower, you more or less
harvest when it's the end of senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I said, you can be growing
different plants and you do it based on
[SPEAKER_00]: when you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: We already kind of touched on that,
but yeah, you also have to match your dry
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of home growers don't necessarily
have dedicated dry rooms and dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: cure rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what you would have in a facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your dry room is half full and these
plants that you harvested a week ago still
[SPEAKER_00]: need a few more days to finish,
leave your other plant and flower a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish those ones, trim them up,
then harvest just so you can cycle things
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, kind of like propagation,
usually your dry room and your propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: as a home grower are kind of your last
thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about your flower room first,
your bedroom second, everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I kind of build it around?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a cultivation facility, there is rooms
dedicated to drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, as an indoor facility,
you also are going to pretty much always
[SPEAKER_00]: have humidifiers and dehumidifiers in that
room because the first few days after you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest and you have a room full of
medical plants, it's going to release a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of water and you're going to need a
dehu to keep it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: After three to five days or so,
the water really slows down a lot and in
[SPEAKER_00]: some situations you can end up a little
too dry and you might actually need a
[SPEAKER_00]: humidifier in that room to keep you at
that perfect consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a home grow, you're more or less
tailoring it around your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I lived in Nevada, I would need a
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you live in Florida, you would need a
dehumidifier, but you probably won't need
[SPEAKER_00]: both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get it close and do pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, there's a lot more control
over what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also in a facility, your harvest
is usually done by a harvest team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're clearing a whole room at one
time and filling their dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas, like I said, a home grow,
you kind of tailor it to based on how much
[SPEAKER_00]: room you have when your plants are ready
and you kind of muck around your schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to get the best product you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timing is money in a commercial facility
and you cannot do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about having a team that can
efficiently de-leaf and harvest these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, get them the way you can get out
of cleaning that room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way within 24 to 48 hours,
you have new plants in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever I'm drying at home, I always get
like a little jealous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always think about like how it is a
commercial facility and how much easier it
[SPEAKER_01]: probably is having a dedicated drying room
with controls for temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not easy to control those aspects
depending on the climate you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, in Nevada where I
live, it's very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always having a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes I just dry in my grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is variation in the temperature
and humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really have a air conditioner at
all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in my drying room or grow room
to where I can get a low temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, a lot of people go after like
60, 60, 60 rule, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% humidity, 60 degree Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes I can't get that low as far as
the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm at 65, sometimes even 70.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, the higher the temperatures
get, the more terpenes are being
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're losing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do get jealous not being able to have
a steady temperature and humidity when
[SPEAKER_01]: drying in particular because getting down
to those, I feel like if you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: dedicated drying room, like in a
cultivation facility, it's much easier to
[SPEAKER_01]: conserve those terpenes and control that
drying time than it is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with everything you said there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very much the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at HomeGrow, you have the opportunity
to wet trim or dry trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have preferences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to do a wet trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people like to do a dry trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oftentimes nighttime without a tent,
they're using hand trimmers, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so they're spending the time to have a
nice manicure buds, or they have,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, there are small home trimmers,
like those bowl trimmers that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those are halfway decent,
but on a commercial facility, some
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities from my understanding still do
want to do the hand trimming, but
[SPEAKER_01]: oftentimes they're doing, they have large
trim machines now, which are handling
[SPEAKER_01]: pounds at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about trimming,
kind of the differences, HomeGrow versus
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you kind of went into the,
some of the basics of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of HomeGrow is almost always
completely hand trim from the larf nugs
[SPEAKER_00]: all the way up to your top buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as much hand trimmed as possible
because people don't want to invest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: machines for small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get into a facility, usually it's
either machine trim or a mix of machine
[SPEAKER_00]: and hand trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take the top quality buds,
have those on a trim team hand trimmed,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then all the mids that are still
sellable, they'll usually run through a
[SPEAKER_00]: machine and have that as a different
quality of product and or sometimes mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: into the top end badge, depending on how
it looks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a massive difference in equipment
as there has been through every bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: this podcast so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're, when you're talking about
trimming, also when you're trimming at
[SPEAKER_00]: home, the majority of your smoke,
most of the time, the majority of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product you're making is your own personal
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can be a little sloppy with your
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't, you can leave a crow's feet
here and there and, you know, under trim
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff if it has really sugary trim
leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're fine with that because you're
you know, it's for you anyways,
[SPEAKER_00]: who cares?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in a commercial facility,
that product is not yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: That product is going to a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some consumers are more picky than most of
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they see a crow's feet on there,
they're going to be on their Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining about your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to trim very tight,
very cleanly.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are a trimmer for a facility,
there is no leave a little bit because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sugary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's make that look as best as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you have the best of bag
appeal and you can leave the best
[SPEAKER_00]: impression on your consumers for your
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, like you said, wet versus dry
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of home growers, and again,
this is based on climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a much drier area,
you might want to dry trim anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way you have some sugar leaf
protecting your product and it'll slow
[SPEAKER_00]: down the actual evaporation rate out of it
and you can get a little longer dry out of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're, again, in a much more
humid area, you might want to speed that
[SPEAKER_00]: up a little bit because you're having a
hard time keeping your humidity below 60%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be more beneficial for you to
wet trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a facility where you have
everything set and perfect, it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: always dry trimmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, the majority of machine
trimming equipment works off of dry
[SPEAKER_00]: trimming, not wet trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to use the machines,
almost always you need a dry product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not always, there's a few that wet trim,
but most of them dry trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on top of that, it's about the
evaporation of terpenes and terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: release.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have your environment perfect and
then you can kind of seal those buds to
[SPEAKER_00]: slow down the amount of air or evaporation
off of them, you can retain a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So usually dry trimming is best unless,
like I said, you're in a home environment
[SPEAKER_00]: to where wet trimming might allow you to
dry at a more proper rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only time I would recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on a side note, wet trimmed product
looks really great for photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like to take pictures of it,
to show off for your Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: wet trimming is kind of a fun way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Curing is kind of the last piece I want to
get into on this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about differences of curing
home versus commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when you're curing at home,
a lot of times it's in glass jars or
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller bags, the chicken bags or the
turkey bags at the biggest, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the size of your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're more or less putting them
in a closet, putting them in somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: that's dark to keep them going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times you're sitting at your
room temperature or whatever, and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just letting it finish up on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't, just like drying,
you don't necessarily have a dedicated
[SPEAKER_00]: room for your curing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in a facility, you have to have a
dedicated room for your curing stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is a finished product that is
worth money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need locks, you need security.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also need a room to be able to house
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, it's not usually batched in small
batches like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The majority of states, including Nevada,
I know you can only test a batch that's
[SPEAKER_00]: five pounds or smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Above five pounds, you need a second test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the times you're using like
five gallon buckets with sealable lids,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they make larger turkey bags like the
ostrich bags and stuff is the actual name
[SPEAKER_00]: of them on the Liberty bags that hold
quite a bit more product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way you can keep closer to like a
three to five pound batch at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Test each batch individually before your
product goes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas a home grower, you're not worried
about testing batches and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just match your container size to
the size of your grow, put it in a closet,
[SPEAKER_00]: burp your jars every once in a while,
you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a larger facility, like I said,
you're kept under a lock and key in
[SPEAKER_00]: security.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also usually a little bit cooler
room, kind of like your dry room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to want it 60, 65 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way everything stays with the
moisture content you set it at and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using larger containers to actually cure
and finish that up to about a five pound
[SPEAKER_00]: point in most states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to mention that the
temperature control that happens during
[SPEAKER_01]: curing and typically in home grows,
I mean, a lot of people don't really care
[SPEAKER_01]: about the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least from my experience, a lot of
people don't really care about storing in
[SPEAKER_01]: a specific temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if their temperature increases,
you know, like I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some home grow jars right next to
me right now in this room and I'm in
[SPEAKER_00]: regular air temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's just personal home
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't really matter to a lot of
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, one thing to keep in mind that if
you're not in a temperature controlled,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're, you know, if you're sitting at
75, 80 plus degrees, you could be losing
[SPEAKER_01]: those terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably are losing those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gifted one of those wine fridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I control the temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much easier to conserve those
terpenes when it's, you know, under right
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature controlled area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went over a lot here, taking a step
back and just giving some general advice
[SPEAKER_01]: to the folks listening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what advice do you have for
those looking to make that transition from
[SPEAKER_01]: home growing to commercial growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a couple pieces of advice for you,
honestly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, and this is obviously
depending on who's in charge of the hiring
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivation, but don't brag about your
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the number one things you
can do to kind of screw yourself out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: job.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they know you have an active home grow
going at that time and you're producing a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot, they look at that for a couple
different negative reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, you could possibly bring in pests
that are specific to medical plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: that facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want that increased risk at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can help you hit a glass ceiling,
even if you are the most qualified
[SPEAKER_00]: candidate.
[SPEAKER_00]: On top of that, there's also try to work
towards your formal education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, it's not the same market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the same place it was 10 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really need to have some formal
horticulture education in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: progress through the tiers at these
facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I highly recommend going back to
school, learning what you can about
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also highly recommend mentioning you
have experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned that you're good with
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may even mention that you've had a
home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do not brag on your home grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can be a problem and put you in a
glass ceiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch out for those mistakes and then
also work towards your formal education so
[SPEAKER_00]: that way they know you're serious about
horticulture in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can increase your chances and
look good amongst those that are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: to employ you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of good information there for those
looking to make that transition from home
[SPEAKER_01]: growing to actually working in a
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_01]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can find me mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more active on Instagram now,
nvclosetmedgrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have quite a bit of old material on
YouTube that you can look through,
[SPEAKER_00]: like 400-some videos, many of which is
very educational, some of which is just
[SPEAKER_00]: video logs of my gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can check me out on YouTube,
nvclosetmedgrower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a website, nvcmg.com,
where I sell some horticulture lighting
[SPEAKER_00]: and videos there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the future, I'm actually in the
process of moving to Tennessee to a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: production facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just recently got signed an employment
agreement to start next month in Eastern
[SPEAKER_00]: Tennessee up in Appalachia, helping them
grow a bunch of CBD-based hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my next task, is moving to the
East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of excited for the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a pretty decent, small to
mid-size commercial facility running
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture lighting group lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it should be a fun experience for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my next task, is commercial
management of premium indoor CBD hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a great opportunity for
you, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll definitely have a link to NV's
Instagram and YouTube down in the YouTube
