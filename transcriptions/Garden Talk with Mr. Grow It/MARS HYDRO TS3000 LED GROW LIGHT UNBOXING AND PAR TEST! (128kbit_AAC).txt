[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka Mr. Grud and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Mars Hydro TS3000 LED grow
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent me over this grow light,
they are sponsoring this video and in this
[SPEAKER_00]: video I'm going to unbox the unit and I'm
also going to test the PAR output using my
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers
[SPEAKER_00]: and measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, first thing out the box is this user
manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lists off technical specifications,
installation instructions, and dimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on the back side there's some words
of caution and it shows their warranty
[SPEAKER_00]: policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has two meanwhile drivers, these ones
will be mounted to the back of the
[SPEAKER_00]: fixture, a five-foot power cord,
a wire hanging kit, and two rope ratchet
[SPEAKER_00]: hangers, and of course the fixture itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to go over all of this grow
lights features in this video but I will
[SPEAKER_00]: leave a link to the grow light in the
description section below so you can click
[SPEAKER_00]: on that link if you want to learn more
about this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light is dimmable in order
to dim the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You flip the driver upside down and remove
the rubber piece, then stick a screwdriver
[SPEAKER_00]: in there, then you can adjust the dimmer
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this PAR test I put the dimmer up to
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full power this grow light pulls about 629
watts from the wall and about 5.24 amps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, this is just to give you a general
idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm taking the PAR measurements in a 4
foot by 4 foot grow tent and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reflective walls could increase the PAR
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also provided a link to this grow
light in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feel free to click on that link if you
want to learn more about this grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys,
if you enjoyed it please click that thumbs
[SPEAKER_00]: up and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you in the next one.
