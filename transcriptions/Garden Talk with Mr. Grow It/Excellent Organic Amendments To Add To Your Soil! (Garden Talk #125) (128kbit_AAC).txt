[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening, and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 125.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Tad Hussey.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been on the podcast once before,
episode number 103, where we talked all
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to reuse your old potting soil
for another grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a ton of knowledge dropped in
that episode, with many of you commenting
[SPEAKER_01]: on how helpful it's been for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Tad is back for another episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, he's talking about various
organic amendments that you can add to
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil, with many of them not being
very well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see short, bite-sized clips
of these episodes, search Garden Talk
[SPEAKER_01]: Clips on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have a gardening channel where I
have over 130 videos showing the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that I've grown.

[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined once again with Ted
Hussey from Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, we had such a great
conversation the first time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: The audience really, really liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was on how to reuse your soil,
and really went into deep, real deep on
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people are now saving a lot
of money because they're not throwing away
[SPEAKER_01]: their soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually able to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you dropping some knowledge
bombs there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got a great topic for today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really just going over a bunch of
different amendments that can be added
[SPEAKER_01]: into your garden, whether it be organic,
all natural, but ways to add these organic
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs into your garden and have a
successful grow from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of these inputs, some of them I'm
familiar with.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of them I'm actually not familiar
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really too deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep of knowledge in regards to what the
benefits are, how to use them,
[SPEAKER_01]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a whole long list here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into the list, can you
introduce yourself for those that didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: catch the first episode we did together?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Ted Hussey.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the owner of Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss stands for Keep It Simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really been the goal of our
company from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out in the nursery and
landscaping business.
[SPEAKER_00]: My parents owned a nursery and landscaping
company for 30 years, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been around plants my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recently, well, not recently
anymore, 20 years ago, got into
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically medicinal plant cultivation
and created for our company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have living soils specifically for
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really work to take a science based
approach at how to grow these plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: their optimal genetic potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have been using your nutrient mix
that you have, nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using that for several grows now
and it's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so easy to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one scoop per plant and then do it a
couple times throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water only from there on out and plants
are healthy and you get to a good harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've definitely used Kiss Organics
products in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got a few on my list here that I
want to purchase coming up here soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but yeah, we met in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to meet at the Soil Summit
over in Pahrump, Nevada and such a great
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only got to make it to the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, I have a five month old
that I have to care for, but I was able to
[SPEAKER_01]: sneak out there for the first day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a great speech on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You and a couple guys from Kiss.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really good to sit down and talk
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I talked to your ear off for like
45 minutes or an hour or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a good conversation though.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so nice to meet these people in
person that you've had conversations with
[SPEAKER_00]: and really talked to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, it was a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope we get to meet up again at future
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely go to the Soil Summit next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there is one, that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's start getting into some of
these amendments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a long list here, like I
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just go one by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with Organic Whole Grain Malted
Barley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that, baby.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the benefits are, how to use them,
your overall thoughts on them,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before we dive into the Malted
Barley, I just want to back up really
[SPEAKER_00]: quick and say to me, the best way to amend
your garden is through a soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have the ability to get a soil
test and then get a specific
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation, we can add back in the
exact fertility that was removed when you
[SPEAKER_00]: harvested your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I just did in my garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's sort of what the whole idea with
the nutrient pack is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't soil test, then the idea is
then we can get you close based on adding
[SPEAKER_00]: a general amount of fertility overall back
in to the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's all these specific
amendments and they all do different
[SPEAKER_00]: things and have different benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really what I think we're going
to talk about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to start with, Organic Malted Barley.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this actually dates back to Clackamas
Coot and is something that he came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with, with the idea being borrowed from
the beer industry that malting barley
[SPEAKER_00]: freezes barley sort of at its highest
enzymatic levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the enzymes in the seed
itself, these enzymes are just things that
[SPEAKER_00]: speed up chemical reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what the idea was by adding malted
barley is you're speeding up a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: natural plant processes and reactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would take the malted barley,
you would grind it up, apply it to your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, and then water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was part of something Coot came
up with as a way of getting better health
[SPEAKER_00]: and growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I've done this a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a trial in my tomato garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I had the farm and I didn't see a
statistical difference on my plants there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something that I utilize on a
regular basis, but we do offer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard many people say their plants
just exploded after trying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some way, it must have been
addressing some limiting a factor of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth in those scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not here to say it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying for me, I didn't get the
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted, but I think it's definitely
worth trying in your garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an input that I haven't tried yet
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard a lot about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of those things that are really
optional, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you don't have to add it in order to
get through the grow, but it is something
[SPEAKER_01]: that could certainly have some benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least it is said to have some benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll have to give it a try in the
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: These next few that we have on the list
here are kind of similar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've probably talked about at the same
time, which is a compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fungal compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's also fish compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought it'd be a good opportunity to
kind of talk about compost overall and the
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between the two.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So compost is a whole podcast in and of
itself, making the compost, determining
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality of the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can vary dramatically depending on what
the original feedstocks were, how the
[SPEAKER_00]: material was actually compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it thermophilically compost,
meaning it killed all the weed seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the pathogens?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it processed long enough that the
nitrogen cycled?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things that go into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be aware.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess the big takeaway is that not all
composts are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to source a high quality one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In general, composts tend to be lower in
fungi than bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we call ours a fungal compost for
one of the ones on our website because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're adding food sources to feed fungi to
get a more balanced ratio there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, really just make sure
that your source of compost is clean
[SPEAKER_00]: because compost is going to be your
biggest contaminant in your grow in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of heavy metals and in terms of pests and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pretty much all pests and pathogens can
be avoided in compost if it's properly
[SPEAKER_00]: thermophilically composted.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the exception of fungus gnats,
any time you bring organic matter like
[SPEAKER_00]: compost into your grow space, you're
potentially adding fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always a good idea to have a plan
for that like BTI or SF nematodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a consumer is looking to purchase
some compost, you said look for a high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there something in the product listing
that they can look for to identify whether
[SPEAKER_01]: or not it is a quality compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a little bit complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every compost manufacturer should be able
to provide you with a chemical analysis of
[SPEAKER_00]: their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which they're required by law to have just
to sell as a commercial compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll tell you some key information
like C to N ratio, that carbon to nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio, to show you that that material is
fully composted, that it's free of
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have that testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they don't really have for you,
which I think is also important,
[SPEAKER_00]: is sort of what are the physical
properties of that compost?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much large particulate is in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How well screened is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that can affect the physical
properties of your soil when you add it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing is the biological
properties of that compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a time when I like to break out
the microscope and throw the compost under
[SPEAKER_00]: there and just make sure that I'm seeing
all sets of functional microorganisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: decent quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the best way to do it is
sort of all three of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do a germination test as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not gonna do all that,
then you really have to rely on the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer or the supplier to be giving
you accurate information or that you trust
[SPEAKER_00]: that what they're providing is gonna be
good or maybe a buddies or things that
[SPEAKER_00]: have tried it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind with every compost that
you add or even compost extract or compost
[SPEAKER_00]: tea, you're adding some fertility,
usually nitrogen and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wanna account for that in your
reamending process so you don't overdo it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned a germination test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of go into a little bit
detail what you mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can just throw some seeds in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Radishes are a good option a lot of times
because I think they're fairly sensitive
[SPEAKER_00]: to herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just some cheap seeds is a way to see
if the plants are able to grow in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually the compost manufacturer will have
germination tests on their analysis that
[SPEAKER_00]: they can send you so that they'll show we
had 96% germination in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know that there's no residual
herbicides or anything else from that
[SPEAKER_00]: compost source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because some composts are made from
different manures or commercially
[SPEAKER_00]: collected yard waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there are sources of contaminants
that could be potentially an issue in your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden, depending on where you're sourcing
it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said not all compost is created
equal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you also say that as far as the
application rates, how much to apply,
[SPEAKER_01]: how often to apply, is there any general
guidance amongst all composts or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to kind of look at the packaging and
get the manufacturer's recommendation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're talking about making a soil
from scratch, one of the most popular
[SPEAKER_00]: formulations is this Cornell mix,
which is a third, a third, a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a third peat moss, a third
aeration like perlite or pumice,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then a third compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I personally like to use less compost
than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll use compost in most of my commercial
mixes around 15% of my total media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once that soil is established and
I go to re-amend, I will rarely add
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, mostly because I don't want
additional contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, I don't want to have to deal
with with fungus gnats and I also want to
[SPEAKER_00]: risk bringing any more heavy metals into
the scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to not add compost every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of folks do and get really good
results too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not here to say that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just need to be thoughtful about
your application rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that soil is in place, you know,
and you're running, I wouldn't add more
[SPEAKER_00]: than a cubic foot per yard of total
compost every cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the max I would want to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving on down the list, we've got biochar
next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about biochar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, biochar is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I became a believer when I visited a
facility and the only difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: the two soils, they were using our water
only soil and then we made a formulation
[SPEAKER_00]: adding an 8% biochar by volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were getting about 8 or 9% better
growth and yield with the addition of
[SPEAKER_00]: biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like compost, not all biochar is
created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a big difference between biochar
and charcoal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do have to do a little research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But by using biochar, you're getting the
nutrients are going to be better retained,
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals are going to be less
available, you're going to get better
[SPEAKER_00]: water retention, and just we see better
overall health and growth with the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that I fully understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, either at least why we're
getting such a dramatic response for from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do need to charge the biochar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're mixing your soil,
you can just add raw biochar at that point
[SPEAKER_00]: in time, there's enough nitrogen and other
nutrients in there that it's not an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I definitely recommend if you have a
soil mix that does not have biochar and
[SPEAKER_00]: adding it in at a rate of five to 8% of
your total volume can really make a big
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your overall plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: biochar is something I've added into my
soil here and there haven't really been
[SPEAKER_01]: calculated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pretty safe amendment to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing to be aware of is it can
alter your pH, it tends to be alkaline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just want to make sure that your pH
isn't creeping up too high to pull you out
[SPEAKER_00]: of an effective nutrient uptake range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something to keep an eye on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next on the list, I have worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in particular, African nightcrawler
worm casting, which is on your website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really made me think of there are
different types of worm castings and we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really talk about that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So worm castings, I think a lot of my
audience is familiar with the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, how to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can break that down for us and
also the differences between African
[SPEAKER_01]: nightcrawler worm casting versus other
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the African is just the type
of worm that is used in this system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a larger worm, larger poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really like the African one that we
carry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's nothing, I'm not here to say
that like African worm castings are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be superior to red wiggler worm
castings, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the most important factors
with worm castings are the feedstock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the worms are fed, the quality of
that, how long the worms work that
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you look at worm castings,
and it's easier with African because they
[SPEAKER_00]: make bigger poop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you should see is a bunch of tiny
balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're seeing a bunch of other stuff in
there, that means that the worms haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: worked that material fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the biggest factor in terms of
getting pure castings and getting your
[SPEAKER_00]: money's worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to sell a red wiggler casting,
but what we found over time was this
[SPEAKER_00]: particular source was higher chlorides and
sodium in the final product that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're always testing these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we stopped selling that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But prior to that, from a biological
perspective, the African looked just as
[SPEAKER_00]: good as the red wiggler, but the chlorides
and sodium were much higher in the red
[SPEAKER_00]: wiggler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we dropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just be sure to look into your sources
and make sure you're adding things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you get too high of sodium or
chlorides in your soil, both of those
[SPEAKER_00]: things can cause issues with your EC and
limit available nutrient uptake for your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, too much sodium can certainly
inhibit some of the other nutrient being
[SPEAKER_01]: up taped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a problem I ran into.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have high sodium by water, high sodium
by carbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I tried using tap water here,
it was a terrible result.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had deficiencies, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: A whole bunch of crap was going on in the
medium there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not a good result at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting that that was in the
worm casting zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, water is the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever I move to a new location,
the first thing I do is test my water and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that it's suitable for
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you can drink is not
necessarily what you want to put into your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil or put on your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry you're dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in regards to application rate,
now is this more generalized versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of worm castings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like typically what I'll do is either cup
or I'll do like an inch across the top
[SPEAKER_01]: layer of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a certain application rate or
general application rate that you advise
[SPEAKER_01]: folks to use for worm castings?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way I approach worm castings is
really because they're so expensive and we
[SPEAKER_00]: usually have limited access to them
because of the cost, I tend to use them
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically for biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will use them, like you said,
with a light top dressing, or I'll make a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost extract or compost tea out of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: An aerated compost tea is a way of
extracting and replicating those
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think those are the best ways to get
the most bang from your buck from
[SPEAKER_00]: earthworm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on the list is Kiss Organics Microbe
Catalyst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product specifically was something
that we discovered worked really well as a
[SPEAKER_00]: diversified food source for making compost
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we called it a microbe catalyst because
it speeds up the microbial reproduction in
[SPEAKER_00]: your tea and it's easier to use than
sticky liquid like unsulfured blackstrap
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we have rates and recommendations
for people to use that as a sort of a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's primarily what we sell to folks
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't familiar with that product at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to pick some up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seemed interesting to use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you basically use it in replacement to
like a molasses, the same dosage that you
[SPEAKER_01]: would with a tea or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a five gallon brew, for example,
you would add a half a cup of the microbe
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyst and a tablespoon of organic
alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be all the food that you're
microbes would need for that 24 hour to 36
[SPEAKER_00]: hour brew cycle in addition to the compost
that you're adding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really all you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes it really easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's affordable and clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: The molasses works great, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of sticky and messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the only reason that we
perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to ship molasses, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought adding a more diversified
food source, we tend to see really good
[SPEAKER_00]: results under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Using that as a as a feedstock.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely going to have to try that
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're on a roll here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just keep on going.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got that neem cake pellets next on
the list.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So neem, the neem cake comes from the neem
tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called neem seed meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what it is, it's the pressed
version of the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what's left after they extract the
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still going to have some
azadractin percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to vary depending on your
source and how well that material is
[SPEAKER_00]: pressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got an NPK value that's fairly
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tend to not use neem as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first started out with Clackamas
Coot, neem was one of his must must use
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we we added it to our mixes and I
was using it in Coot's mix at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we still offer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've I've dialed it back for a couple
of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is sort of the ecological impact of
shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: A product all the way from India to here
because they're not grown here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to get that fertilizer here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think there's sources that offer a
similar nutrient values that can be
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced more locally or sustainably.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second, and this is more of an issue with
the oils, but we did one of the good
[SPEAKER_00]: friends of mine was working with a farm in
Oregon and they actually failed for a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry of pesticide that hasn't been
used in the United States since the 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been banned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what happened was that
pesticide had been sprayed on the neem
[SPEAKER_00]: tree and then concentrated into the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when the farmer here used that
oil, he ended up failing when he submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: his final flower for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a rare occurrence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is something to
necessarily be afraid of, but it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: potential source of contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to limit those as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just think there's other options that
we can turn to that are a little safer
[SPEAKER_01]: that work just as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the 70s, it was a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a very surprising, very surprising
result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was obvious that the farmer,
the medicinal plant farmer hadn't been
[SPEAKER_00]: spraying this product because they
wouldn't be able to source it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that it was there and trace
amounts on their plant, they traced it
[SPEAKER_00]: back to this oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the oil got traced all the way
back to India where they figured it out
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And realistically, the person who was
selling the neem oil didn't realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: the product had been contaminated either
because they thought they were sourcing a
[SPEAKER_00]: clean source as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're getting things
internationally, there's a certain level
[SPEAKER_00]: of trust that we're having to put in terms
of how that product is produced.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's worse for our food,
frankly, but it's just something to be
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we've got humic acid powder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so humic acids are derived typically
from Leonardite.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mined product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very good at chelation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This humic acid powder is going to have
some level of fulvic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The humic and fulvic just relates to the
size of the molecule itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great carbon based input that
you can use when you are doing a foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: application or even a light soil drench
when you're applying other products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put it in the category of things like
surfactants that you would add to a
[SPEAKER_00]: product when you go to apply it just to
get a little better efficacy out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the word chelation,
and I do have a mixed audience here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are beginners, intermediate,
some are advanced, some know what
[SPEAKER_01]: chelation is, some don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind taking a second here to
explain what chelation is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, chelation is just a fancy word for
bonds with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially what it does is bonds with
and makes these minerals or your
[SPEAKER_00]: fertilizer application a little easier for
the plant to access the nutrients in your
[SPEAKER_00]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it heavy metals usually that kind
of bind to that chelate easier?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm speaking a little bit above my head
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not crazy into chemistry here,
but from my understanding, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: iron, for example, can be chelated and
kept in that form so the plant can be
[SPEAKER_01]: uptaken.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mind the ballpark there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, iron is a tricky one because it
oxidizes so rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: When exposed to oxygen, it changes form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like a brokered record bringing
up heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: My thought was in relation to humic acid
is just realize it can be another
[SPEAKER_00]: potential source of heavy metals because
it is a mined product and I have seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: come back with higher levels of lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're using such a tiny amount of it,
it's probably not a large risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're we're talking like an
eighth of a teaspoon per gallon of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, it's just something heavy
metals has been a bigger topic for a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of growers because of regulations around
around growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we just try to limit as much as
possible and for our own personal health,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm growing plants medically,
I want to make sure that I'm growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanest possible product that I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really bring up a great point with
heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's off of a lot of people's
radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're not even looking at
that, but it is a concern and it can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: concern with all natural inputs as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people think, oh, it's just just a
synthetic stuff that you got to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's the whole natural inputs can
absolutely have heavy metals included in
[SPEAKER_01]: there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we actually had we covered it quite a
bit in our last talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to reference people over to that
last talk that we had because you went on
[SPEAKER_01]: for several minutes just talking about
heavy metals, how to check for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: things to look out for, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check that last episode we did together
if you want to learn more about heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next on list, we have coconut water
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is another one that has to get
credited back to Clackamas Coot back in
[SPEAKER_00]: the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: The the idea there is that a seed has all
the nutrients that it needs to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to add fertilizer to get a
seed to germinate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those initial stages, everything it
needs is inside the seed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so coconuts are the larger seeds that
you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by taking the water out of the coconut,
what we're getting is all of those enzymes
[SPEAKER_00]: and nutrients that the plant needs to
start its life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what folks have done is essentially
taken that coconut water or the coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: water powder, which is just a dehydrated
form of that's more concentrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's more affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then applying that to their plants is
a way of getting plants some more
[SPEAKER_00]: essential enzymes and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not something that I recommend
on the regular, but we do offer it and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people really like to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it makes sense commercially
just due to the cost associated with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really try to limit inputs on a
commercial scale because it's all revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: driven and we're trying to create the
simplest, least number of touches to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the maximal result that we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a home grower, I think things like
the mountain malted barley and the coconut
[SPEAKER_00]: water powder are absolutely worth
experimenting with and see what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: results you get in your grow and if it's
worth using on a regular basis or if you
[SPEAKER_00]: just don't really see a benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an input I haven't used just yet,
but it was on my list of things to try in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll probably be one of the ones that
experiment with it in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we have Karanja seed meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Karanja seed, very similar to Neem
in that it's sourced from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a little different NPK value than
the Neem does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a ton more to add about it
other than when I did some microscope work
[SPEAKER_00]: with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I take compost, distilled water,
I add a little bit of Neem cake,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, to it and I let the microbes
work it for a while and then see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Neem cake, we found the microbes
actually increased in biomass,
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically bacteria seemed to really
like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Karanja seed, it actually kind of
had an opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see a lot of growth, microbial
growth from adding it, which I thought was
[SPEAKER_00]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that means in terms of
the properties of the product itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We primarily use it just for a little bit
of NPK and I know it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: Clackamas Coot used in his original mixes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up on the list, I have manganese
sulfate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people are familiar with
magnesium sulfate, but manganese sulfate,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't confuse the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start there because manganese is
very different than magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to apply manganese sulfate at
the rates you apply magnesium sulfate,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would get in a lot of trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: So manganese is a trace element that all
plants need.
[SPEAKER_00]: It performs a bunch of different specific
plant functions, but you need parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't need very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we found more recently with our soil
testing is that plants are utilizing a
[SPEAKER_00]: fair amount of manganese.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just recommended my grow space and I
applied two teaspoons per yard of soil to
[SPEAKER_00]: give you an idea on a rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I can't sprinkle that in evenly,
I add it to water, I dissolve it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I water that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be all the manganese
requirement I'll need for a whole cycle,
[SPEAKER_00]: just to give you guys an idea of how
little we're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the tissue testing and the soil
testing, we are seeing some manganese
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiencies or hunger that we want to
address by just adding a tiny bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, this is a salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got two elements that are bound
together, manganese sulfate, it's salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people just associate salts with
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are all-natural salts,
and this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the source of this manganese
sulfate?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said it wrong there, manganese sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so a lot of these products are mined
and then refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that refining process that
technically people have issue with in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the fact that it is a sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that gypsum is also a
sulfate, it's calcium sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium sulfate, epsom salt,
is also a sulfate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of these things are mined products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are approved for use in organic
production if you can show a deficiency on
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something that I necessarily
shy away from because it's the easiest way
[SPEAKER_00]: to get targeted, available manganese for
my plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will get some manganese potential
eventually from various compost sources,
[SPEAKER_00]: rock dusts, kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're bringing in other nutrients at the
same time, and you're also bringing in
[SPEAKER_00]: more contamination and heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to make a choice there as to
what you're comfortable with as a grower
[SPEAKER_00]: using in your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, if you didn't use manganese,
you probably wouldn't see a visible
[SPEAKER_00]: difference in your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are seeing it in the tissue testing
that the plant is taking it up and is
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we have Agicel 16H, which is a
potassium silicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the benefits, application rate,
so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so many people are familiar with a
lot of the silica products on the market,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Silica Blast or Dyna-Gro Pro-Tect,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Agicel 16H is just a dried powder that
allows you to make your own liquid silica
[SPEAKER_00]: by adding your own water, so you're not
paying for them to ship water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you end up with about a gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: A pound will equivalent to about a gallon
of Dyna-Gro Pro-Tect in terms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And similar to these other products that
we've talked about, it is approved for use
[SPEAKER_00]: in organic production as a foliar
application for IPM, but it's not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: for soil drenches and other uses for
fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is not fully organic, but it is
allowed for use in organic production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people do your research depending on
how you feel about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But silica is amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with stem strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps with drought resistance,
heat resistance, pretty much all forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: abiotic stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It mitigates micro-toxicities of
micronutrients in your leaf by spreading
[SPEAKER_00]: that out more quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't end up with toxicity issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a whole podcast with Dr. Wendy
Zellner just talking about silica,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I learned a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really should be an essential mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if your soil is deficient in silica,
you will actually see higher uptake of
[SPEAKER_00]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting that silica in there actually
helps mitigate heavy metal issues too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is a wondrous amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other sources of silica that
you can get.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just may not be quite as available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some other options for folks are
diatomaceous earth is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's biogenic sources, which just means
it's plant-derived from things like bamboo
[SPEAKER_00]: or rice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, the least available form
is quartz or things like silica sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those I tend to shy away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they may not be available
within a reasonable timeframe for your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adding them, you may not get a result
for months to years in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think people should do a deep
dive on silica and really consider
[SPEAKER_00]: utilizing it in your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up on the list, we have borax.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I haven't really
heard of people using.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you go about using this in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So borax is a source of boron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be really careful with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trace mineral like manganese,
but we're talking just a few parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: million.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would only suggest that growers
use boron or borax.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a soil test and you are low on
that test and you're going to add just a
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny amount, you would mix it with water
and water it in to your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a soil test,
I would not even mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly enough, you can pick it up
at your local grocery store because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the same stuff people use to wash their
clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just be careful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very careful with it because you can
absolutely make your soil toxic and cause
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of issues for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I heard it from is the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had no idea that it was actually
able to be used in the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the next thing something like that corn
gluten meal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So corn gluten meal, it's a byproduct of
corn, the ag industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what they found,
you'll see it in a lot of products as a
[SPEAKER_00]: weed preventer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pre emergent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use it to deter germination in
something like your lawn if applied at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right time in the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that, it's primarily just a
nitrogen source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not something that we use a lot of
with our medicinal plants specifically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is something that we do offer for
folks, but we don't use a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything that we had just talked
about is available on your website,
[SPEAKER_01]: correct me if I'm wrong there,
kissorganics.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I wanted to bring up,
I don't know if you want to talk about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you sent me a usual suspects chart and I
thought this was pretty interesting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of breaks down some of the soil
amendments and what you get out of it as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as the nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to talk about that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, one of the guys at Kiss,
Brandon Hudson, actually kind of came up
[SPEAKER_00]: with, coined the phrase usual suspects
with the idea that these are the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments or fertilizers that we tend to
recommend over and over again,
[SPEAKER_00]: either because they bring in the specific
nutrient that we want, they're very clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very affordable, they're easily
accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where that list came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get it, actually download it
from our website on the soil testing
[SPEAKER_00]: information page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you go to our website, you can also
select amendments based on what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for by mineral, like are you
looking for nitrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can click on that and see all the
things that are going to give you nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: or potassium or phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're dealing with a target pest,
same kind of thing, you can click target
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids, target whiteflies, target spider
mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we try to make it as simple as possible
for folks to find what the information
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're looking for on the various
pages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, feel free to share that list or
I'm happy to talk about any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments at any point too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll definitely get that list
shared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to find out more
information, you can contact Kiss and
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be able to send you this chart as
well and some additional information in
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So taking all these inputs that we just
talked about, what advice would you have
[SPEAKER_01]: for growers using these inputs for the
first time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the best advice that was ever
shared with me is if you're just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: go for it, as in no soil testing and you
want to start experimenting with these
[SPEAKER_00]: things, a couple piece of advice would be
sort of a half cup to a cup per cubic foot
[SPEAKER_00]: is a good rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has a higher MPK value, go with that
lower rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it has a lower one, like alfalfa meal,
for example, you can go with a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher rate of like a cup per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And generally, you can stay out of trouble
with something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a product that's already done
that for you that you can just mix in,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's commercial products like our
nutrient pack, for example, where we've
[SPEAKER_00]: already kind of done that formulation for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to give you a wide variety of
amendments and you can just mix it into
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go through that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last piece of advice I have would be
if you do have the ability to do a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: test, I absolutely recommend it because
that's going to tell us exactly what is
[SPEAKER_00]: going on with your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can then really dial things in
specific for what your plants are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know the crop and we know the
water quality and we know the fertility of
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, we can hit whatever targets
we're looking for, for your particular
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever you do, have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think experimentation is a lot
of fun and I'm always doing experimenting
[SPEAKER_00]: with my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I think that's important
when you do experiment is to just change
[SPEAKER_00]: one variable to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: So add biochar to half your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do anything else differently because
when you start experimenting, add five
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, it's really hard to know
what actually made a difference and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're wasting money on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe one of those things actually was
antagonistic because it added too much
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium or too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just change one thing, see what the
results look like, and then make another
[SPEAKER_00]: decision your next round and go from
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's some really good advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more thing I'd like to add to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is I get some viewers that tune into this
or listen to this and they think that they
[SPEAKER_01]: need to go out and buy every single one of
these inputs and add it to the garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: They absolutely do not need all of these
inputs in order to be successful in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually this particular list here,
you could probably get away with not using
[SPEAKER_01]: any of it and still be successful in the
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's other inputs that you can add,
such as a Kisorgens nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you can use just that and get
through the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've talked about today are just
additional inputs that you can add to
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially get a better result in your
garden, better growth, higher yield
[SPEAKER_01]: quality, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought that would be worthy of
mentioning here right now, because I do
[SPEAKER_01]: have some folks that think they need to
buy everything, go and buy everything
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing is people think that
we're just trying to promote products the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact of the matter is we don't
care what the heck you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just here to talk shop, reveal some
information here and just have fun with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some people watch my episodes
sometimes and they're like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just trying to push products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I don't care what you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go buy what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just talking products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of goes back to the,
um, the fact that we're always in social
[SPEAKER_01]: media, there's always advertisements in
front of us and those advertisements are
[SPEAKER_01]: always products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our brain is just kind of hardwired to
think product advertisement, you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just wanted to clarify that thing that
we don't care what you buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just talking about the products,
talking about inputs, getting tags,
[SPEAKER_01]: advice on these different inputs,
what he uses, how he uses them and so on
[SPEAKER_01]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you sitting down with us
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tad, great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will definitely have a link to Ted's
channel down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you didn't know, he has an excellent
podcast as well, a more advanced podcast,
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to this garden talk podcast,
but kind of more advanced folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are on the advanced side of
things and happen to not know about his
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast, 100% recommendation for you to
tune into his podcast, because I tune into
[SPEAKER_01]: it and I learned so much from your guests
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So appreciate you doing that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you coming on here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've linked to your channel and to your
website in the description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day,
Ted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a wonderful day too.
