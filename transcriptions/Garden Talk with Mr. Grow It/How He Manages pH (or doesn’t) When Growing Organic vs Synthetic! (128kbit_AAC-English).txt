[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have to adjust the pH at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a common thing that people look at
when using synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll mix it up in their nutrient
solution and then they'll adjust to the
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does your pH come out to before and
then what do you adjust it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I adjust it, it's usually around
6.8 or 7 and I try to get that down to 6.5
[SPEAKER_01]: or 6.8 or 6.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you use to adjust down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just the GEH, general hydroponics pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's a phosphoric acid but I'm
not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those acids are very commonly used in
order to adjust the pH down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the organics, are you pHing at
all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you monitoring the pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I can but the plant's been showing
me that she's doing good and she's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think I need to change anything on
that side right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another way that it makes things
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to adjust the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least in your particular case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk about water here in a minute
but your initial water source is certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: going to tell you whether or not you need
to do that pH adjustment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people comes out of their tap at 8 pH
or higher and they're like, I have to
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust the pH or else I come across
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your tap water or your filter or
whatever water source you're using,
[SPEAKER_00]: if it falls within that 6 to 7 range
roughly, sometimes it can be up to 7.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: People swear that they add that in and
they don't do any sort of pH adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: and their plants are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I check mine at the tap, it's at 7.
[SPEAKER_01]: I let my reservoirs aerate overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll stick an air stone in the water,
let that sit for at least 24 hours before
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it to any of my plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also said to help eliminate some of
that chlorine that's in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that extra stuff that you don't want
to give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your local water source,
it uses either chlorine or chloramine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although if chloramine is included,
that's one thing that people really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have it sit overnight, it
disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a stable molecule versus the
chlorine.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just let it sit overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people let it sit and have an air
stone in there like you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people put it in light.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that helps with it dissipating.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first six months when I started
growing, I was buying water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just buying distilled water every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was getting expensive after a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started testing with my tap water and
the plants didn't really give me too much
[SPEAKER_01]: of a reaction to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just stuck with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a buddy live locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was buying water every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was buying reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think over time, it's going
to be worth it to buy a system that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually install underneath your
kitchen sink, for example, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty small.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these are now a one-to-one ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before, a lot of the old systems are a
one-to-three.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically for every one gallon of RO
water that you get out of the system
[SPEAKER_00]: there, three gallons would be wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, like I mentioned, it's a one-to-one.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every one gallon you get, only one
gallon is wasted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buying that, which is 200, 250 bucks
roughly for that particular system,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the one-to-one system,
it can certainly save you money over the
[SPEAKER_00]: long run versus going and buying either
reverse osmosis or distilled.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be very, very costly doing that
avenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely looking into getting
something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm picking up a system for the house,
so I don't have to worry about the water
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore.
