[SPEAKER_00]: We are back and I'm joined with Mike from
420Things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not doing so bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing pretty good, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to talk all about
budget-friendly gardening ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: You like to do things on the cheap,
you mentioned to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, that was a great episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have a lot of people who do
things on the cheap just like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really have a budget that they need
to stay within with that gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be an awesome topic and happy
to have you here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me first because that's
pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Mike, you got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in Ontario, Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew up in Florida though, so shout out
to my 305 peeps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have an amazing partner in crime,
my wife and two great kids and I suffer
[SPEAKER_01]: from chronic back pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really two kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where my cheapness started.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started helping my back with this
medicinal plant and I was an under health
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was getting all my medicine from the
licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: These government approved areas where they
were so expensive, I decided to dip my
[SPEAKER_01]: moderate green thumbs from previous
experiences into growing my own medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did work on golf courses for many years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did irrigation, I did mechanics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was assistant superintendent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really liked the growing season at a
golf course.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would come out and it's like growing
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have a start in the spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd come out of a harsh winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd have to baby the course back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown landscape and then middle of summer,
everything's vibrant and green and such a
[SPEAKER_01]: lush playing area for the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really feel like this is where my love
for growing came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Working on golf courses, man, it's the
same thing, budget based.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all, even on big golf courses,
nice expensive courses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always trying to cut your budget.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always trying to get you to do it
on the cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: MacGyvering something and getting it to be
that, still get the job done and do it on
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheap tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's where it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would you say your overall growth
style is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you typically grow indoors or outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic, synthetic, soil, cocoa,
hydro, what's your style?
[SPEAKER_00]: D, all of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like changing it up from time to
time, it gets me out of my comfort zone
[SPEAKER_01]: and it just leads to learning something
new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I grow both outdoors and indoors
and my wife, my partner in crime,
[SPEAKER_01]: she helps out so much and she's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoors, I've done synthetics before,
but I've got really bad water here so I
[SPEAKER_01]: had to treat it and I was really using my
indoor experience outdoors and it really
[SPEAKER_01]: was expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've switched over and now I'm doing
organic outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do a pro mix, worm casting mix,
Gaia green and man, the cost of that
[SPEAKER_01]: versus bottle nutrients, running RO water,
storing it, pumping it, man, it was
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what every start of the year,
I don't know about your area, but for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I go pick up, I go to garden stores in the
spring because I always have sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always potting and I got to buy my
fertilizer then.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get a big 20 kg bag, a 444 and 284 at a
spring sale, 20, 30% off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, man, I'm saving money again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's so nice to just top dress
outside and just water every couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks or top dress a couple of weeks and
water just regular old water out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works good.
[SPEAKER_01]: My indoor stuff, I'm using synthetic
nutrients with RO and right now for this
[SPEAKER_01]: today, I'm currently growing cocoa for the
first time because like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: mostly pro mix and worm castings,
but I've got an automatic system.
[SPEAKER_01]: My back is pretty bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an automatic watering system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using that both from FloraFlex and
they have got some pretty cool watering
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not bad, but again, you know what
I did?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've waited to 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every company has got, April 20th has got
a sale, 20, 30% off extra, free shipping,
[SPEAKER_01]: blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best time of year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're planning a grow and you want to
do something, try to do it around 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll save a ton of money, shipping and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a water soluble fertilizer,
so I guess it's very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a bunch of bottles, so it's a
little bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 420 sales, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do the same exact thing where I try to
get as many as possible, not just
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, but genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Black Friday is another area where
very deep discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Black Friday and 420 are the
deepest discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where people and companies really
offer the most percentage off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just like you, I take advantage of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you got to be cheap, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to stock up and that's the best
way, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get deeper into your indoor
equipment setup and how you went about it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a budget-friendly manner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like lighting, for example, do you go with
budget lights or are you paying a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more for a certain amount of power or
spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also ventilation system, what are you
doing for that and so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so when I first started,
I got the tent, I got it set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of new to it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, ah, look at these cheapo
beepo blurple lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to get one of those off Amazon,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they were cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: After growing with it, I shook my head a
little bit and go, no, no, no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started looking at some quantum
boards and this is going back probably
[SPEAKER_01]: four years from today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So quantum boards were where it was at at
the time and I found HLG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, an American company,
but man, oh man, their lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing great reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was seeing a lot of people talking about
it, but man, I wasn't able to spend that
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I wasn't in the place to spend
that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, being cheap, I was like,
no, not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went out and I started looking for
alternatives and I found on Alibaba,
[SPEAKER_01]: Kingbright.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Chinese company that shipped
right from China.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, I'm going to look into
this, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started Googling it and trying to
look at videos and I couldn't find any
[SPEAKER_01]: videos on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, listen, man, even, even if I'm doing
a break job on a car that I've never done
[SPEAKER_01]: it before, I go to YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a informative, gives you a
little bit of info.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nothing on Kingbright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start a YouTube channel and
I'm going to, you know, buy this light and
[SPEAKER_01]: do a review and do the process of,
you know, how to get this light going
[SPEAKER_01]: through customs and doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it really broke down to like three
things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, first and foremost, I wanted to
help other people because there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: video, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it was a, you know, cheaper
alternative to like HLG.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, third, I was like,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to start a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be small.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, I might only have 10
followers, a hundred followers,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a business opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this is a business opportunity,
I can write this light off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check another savings, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So no matter how big or how small you are
starting, starting YouTube channel for me
[SPEAKER_01]: was one of my biggest cheapness moves that
I've done in gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can, you know, spend that money
before I get taxed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and did, but listen,
I'm, I'm not an expert on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I hired a good accountant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat down with him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid him for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me pick your brain for an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid him best money I've ever spent.
[SPEAKER_01]: He helped me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me guidance and that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, that was my start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then going into other setups and other
systems, I decided after the light,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to grow an RDWC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see, I see the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's the growth rate is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I want to try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what turnkey pre-built systems
are worth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not budget friendly when I was looking at
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it all myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do a DIY.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do another video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Write it all off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was able to, you know,
to buy parts off of Amazon, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and locally, and, and, you know,
with that mechanical background,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was able to do all the piping and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and again, being handy and like
being able to DIY stuff is another,
[SPEAKER_01]: like God sent to being cheap in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can do stuff, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I just, it just compared to
the pre-built, I was like half or less
[SPEAKER_01]: than half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And price.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, man, when I talk to people
and I'm talking to them on, on social
[SPEAKER_01]: media and I see they're, they're putting
out content and they're doing videos,
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, you're writing this off.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, are you, are you, do you got
like Amazon links?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have like Amazon affiliate or
associate marketing, whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: like it's free to sign up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go sign up, get some links, put them in
your video, write all this stuff off,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, because that, that, that,
and again, this is, listen, this is Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: and every place is different, but hire
that account and pay that money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and just, and help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll help offset gardening costs big
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to the Alibaba Kingbright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually went to your channel and
sorted it by oldest videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been doing YouTube videos now for
four years, 124 videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, that's crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Congrats on all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of hard work is kind of what
I'm getting at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a good idea for a video over
15,000 views on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've heard of some people having bad
experiences with Alibaba.
[SPEAKER_00]: In particular, actually this Kingbright,
I'd like to know, is this still working
[SPEAKER_00]: today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I believe they only offer a one
year warranty where HLG, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe offers three plus year warranty,
if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that light still working good for you
or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That light has since been gone from the
channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I had it, it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a little bit of a setup and
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did it in that video because it was
the instructions weren't that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to deal with people.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Alibaba, the time differences is
usually like you're in day and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to deal with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a hundred percent warranty would have
been, if I would ever ever had an issue,
[SPEAKER_01]: a warranty would have been a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have assumed just because of the
dealings, but I sold it to a guy and on
[SPEAKER_01]: like on marketplace or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he never got back to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm assuming it worked for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had decent parts and yeah, it was,
I used it for four grows probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I never had a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got some good usage out of there and
you able to resell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you able to get some money back from
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, would you recommend any other
equipment to get off of Alibaba or just
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the only thing I've ever done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really only speak to what I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, the process was a bit weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was at the time, four years ago,
this Trump was an office in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was like extra duties and extra
like tariffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time it was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent my deposit or my money via credit
card.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had tracking in a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to spend a little bit extra when it
got to the door and in like brokerage fees
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever, but still it was pretty
cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're on a budget and you don't
have that money for that great best light
[SPEAKER_01]: with the best service and the best
warranty, it's an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the other equipment you can
really find cheaper options on Amazon or
[SPEAKER_00]: any other website.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes going directly to the
manufacturer's website is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: The company's website is beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit cheaper than going
through Amazon where Amazon charges
[SPEAKER_00]: companies 10%, I think per sale or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as ventilation, one thing I
wanted to mention was you don't have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy AC Infinities automated
ventilation that comes with a controller,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is over a hundred dollars,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get an intake fan for under 50
bucks, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's going to come with the variable
speed controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not really going to have the
nice options of going onto your phone and
[SPEAKER_00]: the app and controlling everything there
and hit things automatically coming on and
[SPEAKER_00]: off as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on a budget, you need to
keep things cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly get a inline fan for
under 50 bucks, six inch, four inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can find them for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another option.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I think I'd mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that's what I started with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just a basic four inch fan with like a
speed dial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cheap, but cheap is not always like,
there's got to be a point where you go,
[SPEAKER_01]: is this worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it not worth it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because like you said, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AC Infinities a little bit more
expensive, but that control in the app,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, I can be laying in bed and I can be
controlling my phone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, what did I miss up or what did I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's worth something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is definitely worth a little bit extra
money to have that, you know, that
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnectivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some things you don't want to keep on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be worth it to spend a little bit
more for better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you spend a little bit more for good
genetics or do you look for cheap
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: And genetics, isn't that one of the most
complex questions when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, to me, I go, where do you start?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, listen, I've done cheap genetics,
like cheap, cheap, real cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've done expensive, super
expensive genetics, super, super expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not always do you spend more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you get more or does it equal,
you know, more money, better genetics?
[SPEAKER_01]: But listen, let's be honest, great
genetics are not going to be super,
[SPEAKER_01]: super cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you draw that line and,
and, and, you know, balance between
[SPEAKER_01]: quality genetics, you know, like,
like a brand that's putting into work to
[SPEAKER_01]: make them good, you know, getting,
getting to like that F three or the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, doing the work and behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, Hey, well,
listen, this is their third version of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's got to be better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're putting in the time and,
you know, and or companies that,
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know, offer some sort of,
whether it's a guarantee or a warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and again, you can, you can,
you know, spend a little bit less or a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more and get that warranty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get that ease of use where
you can, you know, pop a 10 pack,
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt through it, try to find that unicorn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you're going to go, Oh, this is the
Holy grail, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to reverse this or I took clones and
then, you know, still fall back on some
[SPEAKER_01]: coverage for, for, you know, uh,
like, like that warranty, I guess that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bad word, but again, so, you know,
backing up there of this and you can
[SPEAKER_01]: recoup some of your losses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, it's kind of like a
win-win.
[SPEAKER_01]: You didn't, you didn't lose out and you
didn't spend a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that genetics, man, it's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is another area where you
can target black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: And four 20 deep, deep discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had the chill out OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 40% off or 50% off for
black Friday.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing for four 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, and there's so many breeders out
there, quality breeders that are given
[SPEAKER_00]: deep discounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would recommend people look,
uh, during sale times is really to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to pick them up, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really off season when things aren't
discounted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I don't, like, I don't, I don't know
if you guys have anything like Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: tire, but in Canada, it's a place called
Canadian tire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, uh, it's got to,
but it's got everything it's, but if you
[SPEAKER_01]: buy something Canadian tire and it's not
on sale, you've messed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being on sale, being that frugal shopper
is going to save you so much money year to
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, all those sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also kind of mentioned it
directly relates to genetics is cloning,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to buy seeds to begin,
but you don't have to buy seeds ever
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't want to, you can just clone,
clone, clone, clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another great way to save money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and again, but it's, it's,
it's try to find that one that like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know for me anyways,
I had one and this was when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: started growing that four years ago under
that King bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I found a, a, a cultivar that was
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't clone it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I lost out and it's like, I've been
chasing that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I I've bought in, uh, four different 10
packs of the same stream and I've tried to
[SPEAKER_01]: get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, well, you know,
everybody knows that's growing plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: one seed to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to find something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, that's, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it and you've got that thing
cloning it and maybe spending a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: extra money on a second tent for a mother
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like me, I have three tents now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two by two for mothers, five by five
for my main grow and a two by four for
[SPEAKER_01]: vegging and mothers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that helps you keep that genetic alive
and live and strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have a cultivar that I had a
beautiful plant of, and I didn't clone it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I so much regret, you know,
I don't wish that upon anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, I bought multiple
packs trying to find it just like you and
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, uh, I'm now like monster cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I really find something special,
I'll monster crop it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cloning it in flower and bringing it
back to the veg stage, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't want to miss out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to lose genetics anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, and that's never again,
is that ever going to happen to me while
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hunting that extra tent can,
can, can save you heartache.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess it's what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into some of the processes and
kind of wanting to know how you do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we're going along and you're
explaining things, maybe you can mention
[SPEAKER_00]: how you're keeping it cheap going through
those processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with germinating and
planting seeds and I'll walk us through
your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm pretty old school on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, now the only problem with my place is
I've got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a basement and I'm in Canada and
during the winter, it's cold in the
[SPEAKER_01]: basement during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm, I don't like the heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's cold in my basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm always battling cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so the, the, the cheapest way I've
found to do this is, is just put,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get a bunch of seeds,
put them in the solo cups, put them on a
[SPEAKER_01]: heating mat, put them in a dome and,
you know, control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That in a very small area, not in the big
tent where I'm spending extra money on
[SPEAKER_01]: lights and extra money on this and extra
money on that small based, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a, a, a, a clone dome.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, maybe that can fit 10
solo cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just go right into,
right into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just barely, barely below the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I don't go very deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I I've had problems going deep,
um, before, so I just, I, I pretty much
[SPEAKER_01]: go, I mean, barely just enough soil to
cover it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then while, um, and then, and then
just, just water very, very, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: slow and use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause again, always looking at
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, it's, it's, it's cheap in the fact
that I have solo cups all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, I get that it's probably not
environmentally sound, but again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I Costco man, I got like 400 cups in my
pantry upstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's, it's one of those things
that it's always there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I, I didn't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's, it's, it's, is there a
cheaper way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe going to do some smaller stuff,
but, ah, again, total cups, that stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that's, that's sort of in the germinating
stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for one, once it goes to seedling,
um, I, I really, that, that key for me is
[SPEAKER_01]: that not overwatering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I have a bunch of stuff from Amazon,
these little 60 mil syringes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I find are handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use those.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a bunch of them for like 10
bucks or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like I said, Amazon and Amazon
associate links for somebody who's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting out, there's so many things you
can use on Amazon that are key.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, just keeping that soil moist,
you know, and that sort of like inch and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half circle around where I put the seed in
and, and, you know, and just, and just
[SPEAKER_01]: water it daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, it's labor intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's not, I'm not automating at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm just doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I want to be in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be touching it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be loving it all, you know,
right then and that part, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, solo cups, reusing solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should, should be buying solo cups over
and over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using the same ones for,
I don't even know how many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic bags over the cups instead of
domes, instead of going on buying the
[SPEAKER_00]: dome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually just use plastic bags,
make that little, uh, micro climate in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, in there to begin until the seeds,
until it sprouts from the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've reused the same bags for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've been reusing the same bags
for eight years now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reusing soil too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing where you can save
money is if you're able to actually reuse
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent so many years buying bags of soil
and using synthetic nutrients and thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: that I wasn't able to reuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of people are just going to
throw that out in their backyard and they
[SPEAKER_00]: say, oh, that's reusing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still being used for plants that are
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can also reuse soil indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a lot of people do it with organic
genetics that you don't need to flush or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just continue to amend and you can get
soil tests and then amend according to the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil test and then reuse that soil over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the same soil that I've been using
for six grows now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they're using synthetic nutrients,
a lot of folks just flush that soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll run water through it, try to get
to a clean slate where there's really a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit, I wouldn't say inert entirely,
but it's kind of drained of most of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they kind of reuse it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've had mixed results using that,
doing that method, but a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_00]: it with success there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I forget to mention that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was reusing my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a bin, like you said,
I've got solo cups, I reuse them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I wash them, I clean them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a bin full of stuff with my worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like one of those like Costco bins or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like two and a half feet wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have a garden outside and me and my
wife, we do a lot of gardening outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to have two jalapenos and peppers
and lettuce and cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cucumbers are the greatest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, that's where all my soil goes out
there and get a little of the peat in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and all that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're right, it's reusing it,
but no, you definitely can reuse it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a big, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I found, and listen, I know you're
very organic and I'm not very organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had an organic grow that I was like,
I did it outside and the taste that came
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even my peppers, I put my peppers in
organic, they're hotter, they're sweeter,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're tastier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I got to do this indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I went to indoors and I had
nothing but fungus gnats and fungus gnats,
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus gnats.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate those little things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got away from organics inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could do it better and I wish
maybe I should do a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: reading into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the synthetic man, pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said I'm very organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've got a book out on it and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still do have synthetic runs and I'm
synganic too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of people grow synganically,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Using both synthetic and organic inputs,
which I feel like is kind of an underrated
[SPEAKER_00]: way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I found outside when I wasn't
top dressing enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, Ooh, these plants are hurting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little shot of food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It perked right up real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely get away with that for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about like environment
conditions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously outdoors, you don't really have
control of the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature, humidity, CO2, all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indoors, when you're growing indoors,
what do you typically aim for,
[SPEAKER_00]: for temperature, relative humidity and
CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I try, listen, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't do anything outdoors, but outdoors
I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have, um, like a little, again,
cheapo beepo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not cheap because if I were to try to
build a greenhouse, it would be super
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got one of these greenhouses in a
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a shelter logic from,
from Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and here it's always like,
I'm in the, I'm on the East coast,
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of mid East coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super hot and humid is what it boils
down to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm always on the lookout for that
white powder and mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, and this is where that genetics,
you know, can really play a role in it
[SPEAKER_01]: too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and so this year I ran some
plants out last year from seed for seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and three of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a single, and then the fourth one,
white powdery mildew from head to toe
[SPEAKER_01]: instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one just, we just cut it down,
got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I don't want to mess with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those three, guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I cloned them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm you're going to be, I'm hoping not so
much white powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, I, then what I do in my,
in my greenhouses, I I've got power out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I do fully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like crazy and have fan like just cheap
Walmart, oscillating fans, 18 bucks,
[SPEAKER_01]: like cheap, but you can't, I don't know
what they are in the States, but like just
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap, cheap, cheap ones, but I'm right
beside the plant blowing right on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps the air moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seems to, you know, be pretty
nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, defoliating is great to help
that outside, but inside, um, I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I started on the cheap route and I
really, it wasn't like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that fan with the, with the little,
the knob and, and it was, it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just, I couldn't get to where I needed
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted it to be a nice temperature,
just, you know, under 27 C.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what that is, Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but anyways, I try to keep it,
you know, with that and with that fan,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was either too cold or I adjust it and
it was too hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's when I, I, and I, and I found AC
affinity and man, their controllers,
[SPEAKER_01]: while not cheap, worth everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three nickel in my opinion, um,
because it just, it makes it so much
[SPEAKER_01]: easier, like, uh, and the control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've, I've got everything dialed in to
my proper camps, my proper humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get that VPD in a nice good zone for all
my different areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and I bump up the humidity and I do
the app is so, I don't even know how to
[SPEAKER_01]: use a controller anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, I used to know how to use the roller
before the app came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's just the app, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's like I said, from bed,
from the couch, from anything it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, just a little bit more upfront
on that unit can, can help not get mildew,
[SPEAKER_01]: not get mold, which again, to me,
that's saving money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm not throwing like that one outside,
I had to throw it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put all that money into, to,
to Gaia green.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put all the effort into the soil,
the bags, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to, to, to spend a little bit upfront,
which is worth the pennies and the
[SPEAKER_01]: nickels, it'll save you on the end on
loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and now I've, I just started,
we're talking about environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just started CO2, um, very new to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and I just started Coco too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was telling you, he was doing Coco.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm, I'm doing Coco and CO2 in a sealed
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm doing it in a very small solo cups
for the solo cup girl that I'm doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is kind of a silly thing,
but it's kind of fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's outside of my comfort zone,
but the CO2, man, it, it's kind of neat
[SPEAKER_01]: to, to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, dialing that in, it's a little bit
hotter than I'm normally and this one I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing in Fahrenheit because all the stuff
I'm reading is in Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I've had about 85, 86,
and I'm at about set and then I'm in veg
[SPEAKER_01]: right now and about 75 to 80, uh,
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that has my VPD just under one,
I think it's like 0.9 or 0.8 or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, man, it's, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: The growth I'm on, I'm, I can't believe
how much it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's probably rivaling the RDWC when I
did that it's so fast, but because I've
[SPEAKER_01]: never done CO2 before, you know,
CO2 is expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to rent a tank and fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I can get my plant to grow twice as
fast in the veg stage, I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested to see during flowering and see
how this is going to turn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if I can spend that little bit
upfront on the CO2, but the end result is
[SPEAKER_01]: I have more medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well then I'm saving money in theory.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to do that calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's out on that one, but, uh,
you know, it's again, trying that new
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the math, figure out, okay,
you're spending this much in CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting this much more yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that much more yield would be this
in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I can imagine that did would be
beneficial from a cost standpoint to run
[SPEAKER_00]: the CO2 and get the increased yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the veg stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant training is done on the veg
stage, watering, feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk us through those processes,
how you go about doing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, training so fun, so rewarding,
so, um, good for like keeping you like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I had more space, but I only have a
five by five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really have to optimize it for that
tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and training is that how I do that
to, to optimize, you know, the every
[SPEAKER_01]: square inch of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to get every square inch tent to
listen always happens, but I used to use
[SPEAKER_01]: plant tie-downs and like, uh, paper clips
or, or, or like, uh, clothes pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: My wife was always giving me crap because
she'd never have clothes pins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and, and just attach it to the pot and
like pull it down, tie it and like twist
[SPEAKER_01]: high kind of plant things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I've gone away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm, I'm a hundred percent bud clips,
uh, from blood trainer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're, they're clips,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're the perfect angle in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not aggressive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're aggressive enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: But man, their attack on the angle is
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, then it's like self-contained
too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was always a problem with the plant
ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, I got big old man hands here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My hands are big, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So to try to get in there and mess with
the plants and, and, and defoliate and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, I was hitting the, hitting the
plant ties, breaking the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: losing out on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and these are all reusable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can throw them in the dishwasher,
you clean them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, uh, even when I was
watering, it'd get, it'd get whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for, in this veg stage, I use that on
my outdoor plants, my indoor plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just, just, just make it a work of art
really, and, and get it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, get it to where it's so, and then,
um, watering and feeding, um, inside in
[SPEAKER_01]: veg, I, I, like I said, I, I use that,
uh, I have a matrix system from,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, floor flex and again, back savings.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's saving time and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Saving my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one of my higher priorities and
this thing, I've got it on a table.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got it on a flood table, like an ebb
and flow table, but I don't have anything
[SPEAKER_01]: cut out and I just put my plants in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a manifold that can do up to
eight, 10 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done two heads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I can water it and it,
and it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just runs off into the table,
shop vac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to pump it and drain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I just, again, to me,
that was the cheapest way to do it and to
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to bend over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's that, that sort of,
it's just, it just keeps the watering so
[SPEAKER_01]: much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to training, I started using
those bud trainer clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were kind of really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far for me, although they are a little
bit pricey in my opinion, I think I ended
[SPEAKER_00]: up buying a 20 pack for 20 bucks or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used to go the cheap route there as
well, just with like ties, garden ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy them for like two,
three bucks at your local Home Depot or
[SPEAKER_00]: Lowe's in the gardening section.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then using those ties and bringing the
branches down and either piercing your
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric pot with like, uh, safety pins,
for example, some people use paper clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Binder clips is what I use very often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually clothes pins.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used those in the past as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are a little bit more, uh,
let's say finicky, but they don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really hold onto the pot as much
using those in the garden ties,
[SPEAKER_00]: but yeah, anything kind of lying around
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good way to save money is using
those things when you're doing the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as far as watering, actually getting
a little bit deeper into water,
[SPEAKER_00]: you mentioned use RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a little bit of misconception
about RO water that people think that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of dollars to get a home unit
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one that is, I believe it's 200
bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I paid for it on Amazon and it's a one to
one instead of a one to three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do I mean by that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for every one gallon of water,
some systems will waste three gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, but my one to one system,
one gallon of water will waste one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you can also take that waste line from
your other system, put it into a bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, five gallon bucket and use
that on your outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put it into their toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, they save money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using that wastewater,
but again, ways to keep kind of keep
[SPEAKER_00]: things cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Filtered water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't use my tap water, unfortunately,
but a lot of people do use their tap
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're able to well water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you do go that route, you might
want to get it tested first to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is going to be usable for your
medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, because we all know now that
if there's an imbalance of nutrients in
[SPEAKER_00]: the medium, some nutrients can lock out
others, prevent uptake from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it could just be a rough battle trying
to get through a grow because you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you think is the deficiency,
but it actually could be an excess or vice
[SPEAKER_00]: versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so I forgot to mention those
things about water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, my PPM is coming out of my well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have hard water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 550 PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have no choice but to RO it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, RO is not like when you look at 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to start with 500 and add
nutrients, I'm going to kill the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it isn't that bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And getting back to the cheap,
I know you were talking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: Budtrainer ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought some of them off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I started, went away from the
ties.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was so many different people,
whether they're 3D printing them or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they were, there were so many
different sort of angles and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt some of the cheaper ones that
didn't have, like, I don't know what
[SPEAKER_01]: Budtrainer, I don't know how they came up
with their method of their bend because a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the other ones, the cheap ones,
they either cut into the plant after,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, only a very short period of
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was too much of a bend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found that again, but you have 20
clips.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to buy any more clips like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those ones are going to be around for a
long, long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find myself putting them on and taking
them off pretty quickly versus the ties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tie them down on the side of the
grow pond.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would stay on the plant for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clips, you can slide them on and then
literally within like a week or so,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sliding it off at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branch is staying as the angle that it
was bent down to with the clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, 20 might be enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I want to get a couple more packs
actually, just because I grow a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you can certainly get away with,
if you're just growing a small number of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, just one pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it might be worth it to invest in that
brand name one, which is higher quality
[SPEAKER_00]: versus the cheaper ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the cheaper ones on Amazon and
they can get pretty cheap, but there are a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people having problems with them
breaking as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, you take it off a week,
use it on the same plant up higher or
[SPEAKER_01]: keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about the flower stage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything in the flower stage that
you can think of that you do that is a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit on the cheaper side versus
spending more money towards doing things
[SPEAKER_00]: in flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I do is I do use trellis nets for
training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've started with the cheap ones,
the plastic ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was throwing them out and I go,
this is wasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep having to buy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's not saving money because I
have to spend money on them all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went with a reusable, washable
trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that's how I use to keep my main
colas separated and not overlapping each
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have two of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one right before the flip that I
do, because we're going to see that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put that one down and I try to,
as it's stretching, I try to manipulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the colas into each one of the little
squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that goes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the second trellis net I put up,
and that's pretty much just for weight and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But keeping those colas separated saves
headaches at the end and throwing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I had some that were overlapping,
touching each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, at the start of my growing,
that was like, ooh.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then sure enough, I had some moisture
in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was all bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, flowering stage, that was my
biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then dehumidifying the air,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like keeping it super dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, a must.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that environment control is a
must.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, a nice, cheap dehumidifier from
Canadian Tire or Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cheapest one you can get on sale,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that environmental control is
stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, to keep it cheap, I try to,
man, it's so like a balance between so
[SPEAKER_01]: many colas in that five by five area
versus that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I cut down main shoots and just
open it up just to have that area where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be nice and airy and nice
and dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate throwing stuff out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me sad every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could just wasted all that money and
effort, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And soil and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping it cheap while keeping it clean
and keeping it, again, that's to me the
[SPEAKER_01]: best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned dehumidifier, and I'm the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always running a humidifier because
it's so dry here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are DIY humidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just search on YouTube, DIY humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should find a result there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one in particular that I know
of that uses that tub that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use for like soil and stuff,
the two foot, two and a half foot long
[SPEAKER_00]: tub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a foot and a half or something like
that maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And somebody's making a humidifier out of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to keep things cheap and
not go and buy a humidifier, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly build your own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could potentially be a cheaper
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might want to look into that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing too, I struggle
sometimes depending on what equipment I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: running.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a reservoir for water and you know,
freaking water chillers are not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are stupid expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I found and what I did was a swamp
cooler for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what all of that really is a swamp
cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a fan, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's blowing on the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't believe just by putting a
fan, another little five or six inch fan
[SPEAKER_01]: from Home Depot, I used a little ratchet,
you know, those little, I hung it right
[SPEAKER_01]: above my reservoir, blew it on the water,
dropped the temperature considerably.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did evaporate some of the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to keep checking the EC and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, but it helped keep the water
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a swamp cooler, if you're looking for
something to help keep your reservoir a
[SPEAKER_01]: little cool on the cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another way you can make things
cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gifted one by Flexi Tank and I
pulled it up right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these things are expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 50 plus dollars for reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep it cheap by using a trash barrel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I go to Home Depot, I bought a
14 gallon trash barrel, drilled a hole in
[SPEAKER_00]: the side, and then put the, I forget what
it's called, the piece that kind of screws
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and you can run a hose from
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, 15 bucks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a five gallon bucket that's a
reservoir that I use for some plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are what?
[SPEAKER_00]: $3, I think roughly at Home Depot or
Lowe's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be able to even find them even
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would never pay money to buy
one of those expensive reservoirs unless I
[SPEAKER_00]: was in like a larger setup, you know,
but me being a small home grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just cheap out and use trash
barrels and drill a hole in the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a 32 gallon Rubbermaid garbage can
and it has wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Handle wheels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can move it around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never even thought of that as part of it
because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those reservoirs and thick wall,
heavy duty, they're expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, no garbage can for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wheels too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about harvest, drying and curing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are processes that need to be done
after the plant is done growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've harvested it and then you need to
move on to dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ways do you kind of keep it cheap
with those processes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen, if, if I was, listen,
I once helped a friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was many years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did an outdoor grow and he had 11
pounds of medicine to trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, we're going to hand trim
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, I'll help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, man, I'm going to take
shifts and I got to take breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hand trimming is by far the cheapest
way, but with a bad back hand trimming is
[SPEAKER_01]: not always a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I did, uh, I waited obviously to
four 20 and I, I got a sale on many
[SPEAKER_01]: websites sell them, but here in town at,
at many of the local, like, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: grow shops, they had, uh, trimming
machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were either, they were crazy
expensive tumbler cool thing, like these
[SPEAKER_01]: barrels that would turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they had some of these tabletop
ones and they had ones that were like the,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bowl trimmer, um, that you,
you know, that, that your hand cranked,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got fingers and it does it,
but they're automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was looking at those and I go,
man, this sure would save my back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, Whoa, $1,400 for a tabletop trimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I go, no way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went home.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started Googling and I found a brand
that was, um, it was a Chinese brand that
[SPEAKER_01]: was not like it had no name of the
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just this trimmer and it was 200
and some dollars on sale at four 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like, I got to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I started doing just to
save the back because I can't hand trim
[SPEAKER_01]: just not, not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so I bought these, but now listen,
these things are very poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quality, um, at this very, you know,
bargain price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but being handy, uh, it was like thin
tin metal for the legs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sure enough, the welds broke on the
like six hours in or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, ah, man, but got a piece
of metal, put it in there, redid it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it still works to this day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to pick it up and put it on these
little shoes, but that handiness came in
[SPEAKER_01]: handy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, and, and, and again, like,
what are you going to do when it's that
[SPEAKER_01]: cheap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I got both trimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, I call them stage one and stage
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: First one is a tabletop with, um,
like it's just fins and you just run it
[SPEAKER_01]: over and take all the big fan leaves off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that sort of automatic bowl,
eight inch or 10 inch tumble weaver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know what to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a tumbler because those ones are
like the, the barrel tumblers and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: super expensive, but I got them both for
under the same price as locally of a brand
[SPEAKER_01]: name sort of trimmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that not off brand sometimes is there,
but you're going to have to deal with the
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that and, uh, and, and listen,
that was, that was the best deal that I
[SPEAKER_01]: dot for different that because hand
trimming wasn't possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I get into, well, then drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, drying, I got these, I don't have
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you don't have space, you got to
do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get those accordion, um,
accordion, like, uh, herb dryers off of
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon is what they call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just like, you know,
10 inches wide, they go down into a small,
[SPEAKER_01]: small thing that was the cheapest way I
could store it and, and still not have
[SPEAKER_01]: like half my basement full of the plants
from the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, curing again into,
into reusable jars that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I would, we use it for
peppers and stuff in the summer from our
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would reuse those, um, those mason
jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he's like, it's going to taste like
peppers.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cleaned it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and again, just reuse the stuff that I
have, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently I've switched my thinking on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is where it's going to,
people are going to be on the fence where
[SPEAKER_01]: this is indeed cheap or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can tell you to start off,
it wasn't cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I got into live rosin as my best
way to consume my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why it's the cleanest, the tastiest,
it's whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to buy that from one of the,
uh, Ontario stores here and man,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was anywhere from 60 to $80 for one
little small, you know, gram of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do the process myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I invested some money into a freeze
dryer and this by far is not cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 4,000 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can you say this is cheap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I then talked to my wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to talk her into letting me buy it
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: She then didn't kick me out of the house
because that was her first idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Second idea was we're going to start a,
we, and I say her because it was not we,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a freeze dried candy business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bought the, the, the, the freeze
dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went to her business.
[SPEAKER_01]: She now is going to write off that freeze
dryer and, um, she has been selling freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: dried candies and making a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's worth its effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever, but that subsidized the
cost of getting the freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I can use it for my medicine and
still be able to, to, to get it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, um, right off of the machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could have written off the machine as a,
as a, as a process of doing content here
[SPEAKER_01]: on, on, you know, the four 20 things
channel, but I couldn't have started any
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of business with it here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the candy business, man, it's,
it's multi-purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You get something for, for one thing and
use it for two others and you're saving
[SPEAKER_01]: money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's going to cost you a little bit,
but man, at 60 to $80 per unit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to save money in the long run
because I go through it quite fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: So guess what?
[SPEAKER_01]: $80, uh, you know, every couple of times
it, it adds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, at the first year of her business
in the freeze dryer, she looks like she's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be able to make some money off of
it, whether we get into the red or green,
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows, but, uh, it's more than more
than what we had.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it, it, it, it is that process,
but washing it with the ice and the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I know what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's worth a little bit extra to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, while it's not cheap,
it sort of is because now it's paying for
[SPEAKER_01]: itself with the candy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching your stories on
Instagram, showing your updates on the
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze dried candy and that you went to
your local farmers market or whatever and
[SPEAKER_00]: selling them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really cool to kind of
follow along and see, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the progress you've been making there and
seeing how you used it multi-purpose,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just for freeze drying your own
product, but using it for candies as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I thought that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got into a couple of stores now,
like we're like, we had to get health
[SPEAKER_01]: inspected and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there is some process I had to pay
for insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there was extra cost on top of it
where I go, ah, it's a little bit more,
[SPEAKER_01]: but these, again, my wife is going out,
meeting people and talking to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, getting out in the community,
man, it is fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, candy is, is my kids love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can use fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like, that's like, I'm going to,
uh, all my, so we, we have probably three
[SPEAKER_01]: rows of jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love jalapenos here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always pickle them at the end of the
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm not, I'm not only going to pickle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to, now I'm going to try to
freeze dried jalapenos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause apparently they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you freeze dry them, bring them back
out, rehydrate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like new, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right off of the stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I'm like, wow, that's kind of
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to harvest, dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I want to mention is if you are
looking to save money, keep things cheap,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't buy a Canada troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I have one of those at super
convenient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it does automate things when it comes
to the drying and in storage, but,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly get away with the drying
process, just using a tent, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or an open room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be with an open room, a bathroom,
although I don't know, there's a germs
[SPEAKER_00]: floating around on the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be using the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's as you're drying in there,
but, uh, that might be a concern for some
[SPEAKER_00]: people, but you could certainly just use a
DIY, I guess you could call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Little grow tents set up to where you're,
you've got to grow 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got your humidifier, dehumidifier,
whatever you need and some air
[SPEAKER_00]: circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to spend $1,600 on a Canada
troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have a unit myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have two units now because I do
like it and use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I were trying to keep things cheap,
I would, I would not have one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not, I would not buy one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then for carrying glass jars,
you mentioned it, it's reuse them over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well worth the investment in my opinion,
because it keeps things fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are kind of split when it
comes to having humidity packs in there or
[SPEAKER_00]: not, but you could certainly store things
for longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have those glass mason jars and
you're reusing them as well.
So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I've, I don't know if you've ever used
those, those bags that, that they came
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that long ago, but the, I think
they're.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grove bags.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've reused those a few times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's the same bag over.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't, I didn't find it was as better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it didn't, it seemed the,
my medicine wasn't as good after the
[SPEAKER_01]: second or third time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm like, oh, if I'm going to buy
these, I went back to the jars when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but, uh, I don't, did you ever,
did you ever try them ever tried reusing
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've tried them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They seem to work pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still like the jars really just to
get things in and out of the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: opening of the bags is just, I know it's
not much of a difference in, in removing
[SPEAKER_00]: product from a bag versus a jar,
but like, it just feels more sturdy and
[SPEAKER_00]: things aren't kind of compacting against
the buds as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I haven't been using them to grow
bags anymore, but I have used them in the
[SPEAKER_00]: past.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't, I just, you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of glass jars, if you're curing that,
that's whether they're big Mason jars too,
[SPEAKER_01]: like you can get some, I didn't,
when I first did it, I had all these
[SPEAKER_01]: little small Mason jars, not small,
but I mean, but there's some big old Mason
[SPEAKER_01]: jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can get some big ones,
uh, from different places.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like time a year or two to get
them would be when they're on sale,
[SPEAKER_01]: like right before, uh, like a,
a jarring season, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like at, at, at Home Depot or Canadian
tire or whatever these places,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll, they'll be sales on them.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, what a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was, uh, so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ty flew by for this one for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, I can't believe we're already at
the hour Mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that that's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's wrap things up here though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, I, you, you mentioned YouTube
earlier, youtube.com forward slash four 20
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that that's my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I did have more videos on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how YouTube is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to a point where I had too many
videos that were age restricted and I had
[SPEAKER_01]: a bigger, um, like.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had more videos of those, so I had to
cut back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been spending a lot of time on
Instagram doing that there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's four 20 things grow because somebody
already else had already had four 20
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So four 20 things grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm planning on going to a couple of
shows and events coming months here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to in sep.

getting to talk to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I can talk to someone in the
elevator that I don't even like,

I'll have a conversation with them.
