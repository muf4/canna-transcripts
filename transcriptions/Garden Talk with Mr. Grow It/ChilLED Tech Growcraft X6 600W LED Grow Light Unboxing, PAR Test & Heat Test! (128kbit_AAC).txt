[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and you
[SPEAKER_01]: watch my extras channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Hydro sent me over the Chilled Tech
x6 600 watt LED grow light and in this
[SPEAKER_01]: video I'm going to unbox the unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to test the power output and I'm
going to do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to go over all the specs
that this grow light has but I will leave
[SPEAKER_01]: a link in the description section below so
you can learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This light is shipped in two boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the boxes has the fixture and the
other box has everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's open up the smaller box first.
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing out the box is a power cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next out the box is this bag which has the
dimmer and the small white box and also
[SPEAKER_01]: four rope ratchet hangers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this box is the driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: They use a Meanwell 600H driver.
[SPEAKER_01]: The invoice is in the box and lastly they
have included two Chilled Tech stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next box only has the fixture in it
and the fixture is wrapped in a plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the power test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Range Power Meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_01]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is your first time watching my
power test videos I do them just to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you a general idea of what the power
output is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take measurements in group tents which
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: This LED grow light has a coverage area of
four feet by four feet and I'm taking
[SPEAKER_01]: measurements in a four foot by four foot
grow tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: This light does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll set the light to 100% for the power
test.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay I've plugged the light into my
kilowatt meter and I've adjusted the
[SPEAKER_01]: dimmer all the way down to the lowest
setting and it shows 0.45 amps pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: about 46 watts from the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I've adjusted the dimmer up to 100%
and it shows 5.1 amps pulling 600 watts
[SPEAKER_01]: from the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get started.
Let's
get started.
Let's get started.
Let's get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light down in the description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace.
