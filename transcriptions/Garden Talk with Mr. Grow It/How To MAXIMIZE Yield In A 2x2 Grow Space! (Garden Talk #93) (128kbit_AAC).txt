[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a two-by-two, you know, that's 16 tops,
give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can get 16 tops on one plant and
they all have about five to seven nodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a perfect canopy to start flower
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come home to happy, healthy plants when
I have organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm dealing with synthetics,
I tend to do something wrong or I overfeed
[SPEAKER_00]: or something goes wrong and then I end up
with issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to keep a quicker cycle if I can,
but I also want to have the most yield I
[SPEAKER_00]: can get out of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have to veg a little longer,
I will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Worry about it the next run, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's my best bet is to keep my
stress levels down because it's very easy
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're passionate about these plants
to let it get to you and stress you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the happier I am,
the happier my plants generally are.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast, this episode
number 93.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview two-by-two
Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for three years and
he grows in a, you guessed it,
[SPEAKER_01]: two-by-two grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: He focuses on maximizing that grow space
in order to achieve the highest yield
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're going to talk about
in today's episode.

information of all plants to the general
[SPEAKER_01]: public.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode
[SPEAKER_01]: for sponsoring this episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their clip-on oscillating fan is awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be using their 6-inch version,
but they also have a 9-inch version.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's easy to clip on the side of my grow
tent and has 10 different speeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which makes it easy to control air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have a non-oscillating version of
this clip-on fan as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also connects to their Smart Controller
69, so you can control the fans and other
[SPEAKER_01]: AC Infinity equipment through their app
from your smartphone.
[SPEAKER_01]: The discount code MRGROWIT15 works on both
Amazon and their website acinfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today I'm joined with Vince, but most of
you know him as 2x2 Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing very good, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about yourself, man?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you coming on today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, looks like I have a visitor over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My cat Max likes to jump up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love the kitties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're just gonna keep on recording.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna let him settle down and then
we'll continue on with this episode.
Sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you grow in a smaller grow space,
two feet by two feet grow space to be
[SPEAKER_01]: exact, and you maximize that space,
which helps, of course, maximize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, training the plants to fill up the
space is a given, but there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this episode, I'd like to get into
your way of maximizing yield in a small
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been gardening medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since 2019, so about three or four years
now, my first real experience with
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening in general was, you know,
four or five, six years old at my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandparents' house.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had nice backyard, lots of cool
plants growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember having an apricot tree back
there that I just broke a branch off of
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuck in the ground and, you know,
let it do its thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually we were getting fruits off
of it, which is very cool to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ever since then, I've always kind
of had a interest in plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start off by talking about your
current grow setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I know you're in a two foot by two
foot grow tent, correct me if I'm wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about your
setup, like what brand grow tents,
[SPEAKER_01]: what lighting you're using, other
equipment, so on and so forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in a, it's technically it's a 26
inch by 26 inch by 55 inch grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand is called One Deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty standard grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: My lighting, I have a Viper Spectra P1500,
150 watt LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far as my other stuff in there,
I have an AC Infinity T8 fan, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: one with the controller, which is,
it's definitely overkill for such a small
[SPEAKER_00]: space, but I bought it for a larger tent
that I have that I'm still waiting to set
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just keep it at a lower setting and
it does great for that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the T8, that's the big boy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a lot of people are using that in
like large, like four by eights or 10 by
[SPEAKER_01]: 10s, things that have full rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly what I was, what I got it
for was a four by eight Vivo Sun tent that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just waiting to set up at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in a two by two, what would you
typically run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe like an ideal world, like a four
inch setup or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say a four inch is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything else is going to be a little bit
overkill.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to say that it's okay to
have a little more fan than you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: but if you have a little less,
you're still going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like before I had the AC Infinity,
I was just using like small little desk
[SPEAKER_00]: fans, using how you stick them in the vent
and just have it pulling some air in,
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling some air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, as long as you have air
exchange, I think you're okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are you growing auto flowers or photo
periods?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I have not done any auto
flower work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've only worked with photo periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Auto flowers are cool though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think just a little more unpredictable,
but for the most part, I think it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I wouldn't mind having an auto flower
run under my belt eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing an auto flower run right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I heard a long time ago that
they were recommended for beginners and a
[SPEAKER_01]: different conversation here, but I got to
disagree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could be tricky in some areas,
especially if you have that stunt growth
[SPEAKER_01]: within the first 20 or 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could really stunt a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then end up with a real small auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, so photo periods is what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now are you in soil or cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing a hydroponic system or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: My current run is in cocoa, pure cocoa,
no perlite or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The run before this, I was in roots,
big roots was the soil brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a super soil mix, but really
enjoyed that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the systems, I mean,
I like all systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're all fun to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a matter of budget and just how
much time you have to invest into your
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you start with the brick of cocoa or
was it a bagged cocoa that's already kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of pre rinsed and all that stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it was a bagged cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand is Mother Earth Cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that like you're saying,
before I go for a brick, if I can find a
[SPEAKER_00]: bag of cheaper, kind of less expensive
bagged cocoa, I'd probably go with that
[SPEAKER_00]: over any of the bricked options.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some pretty cool options out
there for the bricks as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in almost like a puck with the
bag attached and you just kind of fill it
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think floor effects does it and maybe
some other companies too, but I like that
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've mostly used the bricks and it's good
for shipping purposes, but one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: bricks I had from some brand, I don't even
remember the name of it, like super salty,
[SPEAKER_01]: like even after rinsing and buffering it,
still had problems with my plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I had this other brand, which I can't
think of this name either, that I got off
[SPEAKER_01]: of Amazon pretty recently and no issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't even rinse or buffer because
I'm doing some sort of testing I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: going on here, but didn't rinse or buffer
and I had no issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of a hit or miss with the
bricks in my experience, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people do tend to go towards the
bagged stuff since it is typically already
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rinsed and buffered and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what size grow pots do you use and
type grow pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in fabric or plastic or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Current run, I'm in one gallon plastic
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they say one gallon, it's a seven inch
tall pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's a little bit less than a
gallon, but I would call it a one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are you using for fertilizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to imagine you're probably not doing
organics, probably doing, you have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: synthetic lineup that you're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so for this run, I'm using Mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used plenty of other bottled
nutrients, slow release, dry amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all work at the end of the day when
we use them properly, but I would say for
[SPEAKER_00]: me, I kind of prefer organics over the
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to pick between the two,
just the ease of use along with just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, kind of feeling better about it
at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I come home to happy, healthy plants when
I have organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I'm dealing with synthetics,
I tend to do something wrong or I overfeed
[SPEAKER_00]: or something goes wrong and then I end up
with issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's on me more than the nutrient
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd say the nutrients themselves
are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just for ease of use, organics is
what I kind of really like to do more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Mills lineup that you're using
right now, tell us a little bit more about
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it like an A and B for veg and A and B
for flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then is there additives that you're
using as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so there's only an A and a B and
you use the same A and B for veg and for
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just for flour, you would increase the
PPMs of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few different additives,
like they have a silica additive called
[SPEAKER_00]: Vitalize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a monosilic acid, so it's,
you know, it's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be ready for the plant to
use right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a veg additive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Start R.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge nitrogen boost to kind of,
you know, lean the NPK towards veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in flour, for the first two or
three weeks, you're using the Start R
[SPEAKER_00]: still.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, you would switch over
to their C4 for the next three weeks or
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the final three weeks,
you're using an additive called Ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: PK, which is just a huge
phosphorus-potassium boost, just right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end, right when they need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's pretty much all the
bottles they have for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so they have a feeding chart that
you're following, but I assume you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing like a reduced dosage throughout,
or are you doing a full dose?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way they have their feed chart set
up, they have a light mix, a medium mix,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a heavier mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: For this run, I went with the light feed
mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much went issue-free for almost
the whole grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say around week four or five,
when I switched over to their C4,
[SPEAKER_00]: I started having some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it was probably a phosphorus
toxicity, which led to a magnesium
[SPEAKER_00]: deficiency in some of the plants,
just like it was just too much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main problem for me in this tent was
nine plants in a two-by-two is just it's
[SPEAKER_00]: too many plants for me personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to see what would happen
more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that I would have done much
better if it would have been just one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants in the same space in the same
time versus doing nine plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to keep nine different plants
healthy and happy versus keeping one or
[SPEAKER_00]: two plants healthy and happy in the same
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just end up with an easier time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was gonna ask you how many plants were
in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nine one-gallon containers in a
two-by-two, that's what you're doing right
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, insane, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit of an overzealous
challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always tried to keep it to one plant
per square foot is the max I really want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen places I've worked for do it
this way, where they'll throw this many in
[SPEAKER_00]: such a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to see what would happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure enough, I ran into some problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having nine smaller plants, there's just
no way I can get them to take that much
[SPEAKER_00]: light in the same way that I could if it
was one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you figure if you have nine plants
with four branches, each of those four
[SPEAKER_00]: branches can only take a certain amount of
light versus having one plant with 36
[SPEAKER_00]: branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all 36 of those branches can absorb
all of that light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll end up with a better overall final
product, I would think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it definitely comes with its own set
of challenges running more smaller plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in that grow space versus one or two
larger plants in that grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's pros and cons to both,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things is kind of
getting into the grotenta water,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you have an auto-watering
system or if you're doing hand-watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hand-water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a little cup that I would just kind
of reach in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, it's a small tent, so my arms can
reach back there and I keep the bottoms of
[SPEAKER_00]: my plants pretty well pruned, so I don't
have to worry about breaking any branches
[SPEAKER_00]: down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's definitely an ordeal and it's
gotten me to think, man, if I would have
[SPEAKER_00]: had an auto-watering system, I probably
would have had a lot easier time there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, I think if I was going to
do any kind of automatic system in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd probably either be living organic
soil with some blue mat drippers or an
[SPEAKER_00]: auto pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I can really only do
one plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be for the next round.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or even a flood and drain would be a
potential for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it's an experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of your ideal state?
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you done before?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done just one or two plants in
that before?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, in your opinion, is the ideal state
for maximizing yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you just do one plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you do a couple plants or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: For maximizing yield, I think that one
plant, like I was saying, is probably my
[SPEAKER_00]: best route, simply just because I can have
one large, healthy plant absorb a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: light, a lot more nutrients, and probably
cycle through water faster than I could
[SPEAKER_00]: having nine different plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each plant's an individual,
so you're going to have a problem on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not going to have a problem on
this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you end up having to adjust the feed
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just not worry about it and let
the round finish and try and just learn
[SPEAKER_00]: from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, for me, next round,
one plant's going to be a lot better in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of overall yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the way I gauge my yield is the
shape of my canopy, the cubic dimensions
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want about two vertical feet and then
the entire area of my grow tent filled for
[SPEAKER_00]: maximizing my yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a two by two space, so I need,
what is that, eight square feet or eight
[SPEAKER_00]: cubic feet of canopy space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can do that with nine plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could do that with one plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on, obviously,
if the one plant might take a little
[SPEAKER_00]: longer to veg that amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's worth it if I have only
one tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I only have one tent, then I'm only
vegging and flowering in that same space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have a separate space to veg that
one plant for, even if right now my
[SPEAKER_00]: current veg setup is just a single T5
light that I have underneath my desk,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just throw plants under there just
to keep them alive and growing a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit at a time while I have my flowering
tent up and running.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so one plant and a two by two.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what would be the ideal pot size
for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: For ideal pot size, I mean, I would say
for a two by two, I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_00]: put anything larger than a two gallon in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, I know with a three
gallon, I could probably fill maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: three by three or a four by four with a
single plant given the right amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: time and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, going back to my current
setup, I've got nine plants in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: nine one gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nine gallons of media, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have one two gallon pot, that's two
gallons of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that two gallons of media is going to
obviously dry out a lot faster than nine
[SPEAKER_00]: gallons of media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also going to put a lot less
stress on my exhaust system, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The fans aren't going to have to pull as
much moisture out of the air if there
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't as much moisture being dumped into
the room through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say for me, like I said,
the next round I have is going to be just
[SPEAKER_00]: one single gorilla glue plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have it in a two gallon pot right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just threw it in maybe a week ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: My current run is going to be chopped on
Monday or Tuesday.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully by that time, this plant that
I have ready to go will only need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: vegged for a few days or so before I can
flip it to flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way I want to keep a quicker cycle if
I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I also want to have the most
yield I can get out of that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have to veg a little longer,
I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think individual goals definitely
come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so many different ways to
go about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had mentioned that you would go with a
two gallon, one two gallon plant in that
[SPEAKER_01]: two by two space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know people who are running five gallon,
one five gallon in that space,
[SPEAKER_01]: one seven gallon in that space,
one 10 gallon in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing the synthetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's people who's running
organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are so many different ways you
can kind of go about it when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: pot size, media, inputs, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's really interesting to hear
your experience there and what you would
[SPEAKER_01]: say is ideal for that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing I didn't ask about was
sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using any sugars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a lot of people use molasses or any
microbial inoculants or any other inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: So far as sugars or molasses, nothing like
that at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when I was doing the organics,
I didn't do any kind of compost teas or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not opposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just I'm in an apartment, so it's kind
of harder for me to have a tea brewer set
[SPEAKER_00]: up or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's all good stuff,
especially if you're in organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can add some sugars and just feed your
microbes, keeps the turnover rate going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far as my microbial inoculants that I'm
using, I'm using it's Extreme Gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: Mycos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the water soluble one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really only use it to kind of like flush
my media, like as in almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if I was about to flip the
flower and it's like I didn't know I was
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding a bunch of veg nutrients,
I might hit it with some Mycos plain water
[SPEAKER_00]: before I flips.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it's like I get most of that,
you know, excess nitrogen out and can
[SPEAKER_00]: start with the flowering nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, you know, some people say,
you know, or I guess it's proven now that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant wants nitrogen maybe for the first
three weeks or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably less beneficial than I
would think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like to use microbes and you
know, especially in organics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty much that's what you need in
organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got to have the worker bees
in there breaking down the organics and
[SPEAKER_00]: just feeding the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we talked about your grow tent
setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about what you use for inputs,
talk about pot size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess one thing I didn't ask about was
like transplanting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you just planting directly into those
one gallon containers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you starting in like a solo cup and
then transplanting up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how do you do your transplants?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, we'll get into
trainings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what you do for plant training.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far as transplants go, the current run
I had started out in small eight ounce
[SPEAKER_00]: Styrofoam cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very small, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wish I would have started them in
solo cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would have ran into less issues
with a larger pot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I go about transplanting is I kind
of like to look at the plant from the top
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I can still see any of the soil,
then I'm not ready to transplant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I can't see the pot or the cup at
all, then I know it's probably ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you transplant up, you get to your
final container.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do for trainings?
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you do the trainings?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when do you stop the trainings
that you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so for training, I would say this in
an earlier part of the grow, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we're in the solo cup, I'm pretty much
just topping with occasionally I might do
[SPEAKER_00]: some super cropping, I might bend a branch
if it's really tall and lanky.
[SPEAKER_00]: For veg, mostly just low stress training
or, you know, Scrog, I might use the net
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of keep my branches low and wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want my plant to be as low and as
wide as I can possibly get it before I
[SPEAKER_00]: flower it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topping works really well for that just
because, you know, you can decide how many
[SPEAKER_00]: branches do I want each plant or my
current plant to have in general,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have one top with about seven
nodes in each of my trellis holes in a two
[SPEAKER_00]: by two you know, that's 16 tops,
give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can, if I can get 16 tops on one
plant and they all have about five to
[SPEAKER_00]: seven nodes, that's a perfect canopy to
start flower with, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're trying to get up to those 16
different tops or branches to fill up each
[SPEAKER_01]: one of those individual holes on the
trellis net.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do you put up the trellis net?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how many days are you vegging for?
[SPEAKER_01]: And when do you like put up the trellis
net?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what is the height from the
trellis net to the like the top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: grill pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in terms of the height of the
trellis net, I mean, that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: depend on your space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In my situation with the 55 inches of
vertical space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about five inches at the top was
where my light is and it has to be hung a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain distance from the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say about 15 inches from the light
to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want about two feet of canopy,
which leaves me with like about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, four and a half inches of
leg that I can have when I have seven
[SPEAKER_00]: inches of inch tall pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So vertical space is what I'm always
fighting in such a small space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my trellis net, for this current run,
I played with it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started it out low at about 10 and a
half inches, because I knew, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is as high as I want my legs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just made sure that before I flipped,
none of the branches were really going
[SPEAKER_00]: above the net.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to keep it all even.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once I had the full area filled,
the full two by two fold, I let them
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch up a little bit to get some
vertical length, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I wanted some canopy to start with
about, you know, six or seven inches of
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once I flipped, I just moved the
net up above the plants so that they would
[SPEAKER_00]: have to grow and stretch up into it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that worked out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, you know, they stretch mostly
during the first three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So during those first three weeks,
man, they're stretching about an inch a
[SPEAKER_00]: day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, I started out with a 10
and a half inch tall plant and right now
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sitting just under 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I mean, it was pretty close.
[SPEAKER_00]: The main thing I like to do too is once
I'm done with that first initial three
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, I like to take, you know,
some kind of tie and tie any runaway tops
[SPEAKER_00]: or taller branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to tie them directly to the net
just to where they're even with the other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, colas and the canopies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you know, I want the most even
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get so that we don't have any one
bud pulling more light than the other or
[SPEAKER_00]: shading out the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can avoid that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after flipping to flower that stretch
period, you know, two, three weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're probably making constant
adjustments to make sure some of the tops
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't dominating others, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you see one that's going up here and
this other one's over here, you might pull
[SPEAKER_00]: this one to the next trellis hole over
just to lower it a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep it as even as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, life happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it gets away from us all,
but it's going to be okay because even if
[SPEAKER_00]: you get one random top that's,
you know, way taller than the others,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where our friends super cropping
comes in and we can just bend and break if
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: We never want to, but if we have to,
we will.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, defo leading or lollipopping,
do you do either one of those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far as lollipopping goes, I really like
to only do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In week one of flower, just to kind of
initiate that stretch, I'll lollipop
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually like I'll go almost to the top
node, top three nodes max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've noticed, you know, that's,
it's kind of like the plants like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, what's attacking me down here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I better grow up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really just induces that stretch,
you know, and that's, that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to start with a smaller plant and
finish with a medium sized plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus starting with a medium sized plant
and finishing with, you know, I don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: my tops to be too close to the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that quite a few folks that are
just tuning in on podcast platforms and
[SPEAKER_01]: even the folks that are on YouTube,
trying to get a visual of how you do
[SPEAKER_01]: things, but you do have an Instagram,
which I'll be sure to link down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube description section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then folks can go there and click on
there and actually see what your setup is,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you do it, because you've got a ton of
pictures on there that clearly show
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd mention that one right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've done your lollipopping,
defoliating.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got your plants in the net spread
out, maximizing the stretch is done after
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just flowering, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just kind of getting through the flowering
period, just feeding as you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: watering as you need to, and so on and so
forth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot to say about defoliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you've heard of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three of light and they do, uh,
they do defoliation day 21, day 42,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've kind of tried it and it's worked
very well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I always do those defoliation days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do just like they say, I take off every
single family, larger family, especially,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, anything blocking the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really just want to maximize light
penetration through, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the certain amount of canopy that I have,
you know, if I only have two feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: canopy to work with, I got to make sure I
have a light that will penetrate that two
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way my bottoms aren't looking as bad
as they could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've had it happen where,
you know, you don't get any light down
[SPEAKER_00]: here and you end up with the fluffy
popcorn bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, at the end of the day,
we want the good tasty sticky cold is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get at the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with the methods that you
explained, especially when you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: lollipopping, you get rid of a lot of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, the, the, from the net
upwards is usually hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to take it back and bring it back
to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you using for a water source?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so as I said, I'm in an apartment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my tap water, it's, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 240 something PPM is pretty
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, normally I would never ever use
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have before and you know, you get mixed
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, currently I'm going across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a ride aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a little water dispensing
machine out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for like two bucks, I get a five gallon
bottle and I've checked the PPMs and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: like 12 to five to 12 PPMs, which is like
nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very, very clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so that's what I'm using for water
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reverse osmosis technology is
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's water stations you get and
it's about the same PPM, very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very low.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you monitor the pH of the medium at
all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or your initial water source?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, what do you aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so far as the media goes, uh,
currently I'm not monitoring it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, I don't check my runoff or have a
meter that checks it, but it's hit and
[SPEAKER_00]: miss, you know, uh, I do monitor it
whenever I water or feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the way I kind of do it is I'll,
I'll check the PPMs of the plain water
[SPEAKER_00]: before I add any nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then each bottle that I add,
I check the PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pH afterwards just to kind of see
how it affects it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, yeah, I monitor it,
but, uh, I'm not super concerned with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm more concerned with the EC PPM or
TDS over the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the pH to me is more important
in like a true hydroponic system where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, if you're in, if you reach your
constantly suspended in the water or
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly being, having water run over
them, then pH is probably more,
[SPEAKER_00]: more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, that really affects how
much nutrients you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas in a media situation, I feel like
you end up not having to worry about pH as
[SPEAKER_00]: much just because the plants produce those
exudates that can adjust the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: accordingly to what the plant wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I just keep it in range,
you know, within, I usually aim for five,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight to six, two for my, for cocoa,
at least in organics, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't check pH or worry about it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I know that there's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff in the soil that's pretty much going
to adjust the pH to what it needs to be at
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for cocoa, I know it's a little more
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try and just make sure that when it's
about to get watered in, it's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: five, eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, temperature is important too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't want it to be too cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like any colder than 68 degrees is too
cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any warmer than 80 degrees is probably
a little too warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I usually try and keep it 70 to 75
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and obviously like I was saying,
EC is more important to me than pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I really try and monitor what I'm
putting in and at what times, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't, I can't feed a plant
that's, you know, smaller, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a fresh clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't feed it the same way that I would
feed a plant that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a week away from being chopped down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you got to know what you're
feeding that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in cocoa five, eight, five point eight
to six point two pH going in, ignore the
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for PPM or EC, are you doing,
are you monitoring the runoff for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or is it just what you're putting in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are your nutrient mixes that
you're putting in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I only monitor it going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the only time I'm ever going to check
my runoff is if I'm having a problem,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, if I'm, if I'm noticing one plant
has some sort of, you know, burn or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or just a look to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might check the runoff to that,
but normally if I have any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient burn, I'm just going to flush
that plant just for that week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just not give it any nutrients,
just hit it with some plain pH water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or even then sometimes that's a good time
to use a microbe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have some mycos and you
know, you have a plant that's struggling
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can hit it with some mycos and it
might help eat up whatever built up salts
[SPEAKER_00]: are in the media to, you know,
hopefully get it back on track.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the feeding chart that you
follow earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know offhand what the ECs are going
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the EC offhand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that for my most recent feeding,
I gave them a very light dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 300 PPMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was my final feeding and my next
watering here should be tomorrow or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be just plain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forced habit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we've heard both ways that it's
beneficial or non beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just noticed that it really does help
with kind of bringing out some color along
[SPEAKER_00]: with just, you know, peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it might not work that way where
it's, you know, I know I'm not flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: anything out of the plant, but if the
plant doesn't have anything else to eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to start eating itself,
which is, you know, senescence.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to push that towards the end of
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about plant training.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about nutrition to very
important things when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximizing yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into environment that certainly
can impact the amount of yield that you
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if your environment,
temperature, humidity, CO2 are in a whack,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could see a significant stunting
growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's break it down one by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What temperature do you typically aim for?
[SPEAKER_00]: For temperature in my grow tent,
I like to keep it under 80, above 70 if I
[SPEAKER_00]: can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had it go up to, you know,
86 in there and you don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: problems as long as you're, you know,
kind of closer to the beginning of flower
[SPEAKER_00]: or in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: But towards the end of flower,
I do like to keep it a little cooler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I have it aimed for 70 to 75
degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an AC in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's a two by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just use my, my apartment's central
AC and that does enough to where I keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty cool in there and don't have to
worry too much about the temps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically aim for?
[SPEAKER_01]: For RH?
[SPEAKER_00]: For veg, as high as I can get it in there,
I like to keep it pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, 70 to 60 is pretty ideal for me
in terms of veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: For flower, I'd keep it 60 to 50 is about
where I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anywhere in that range is usually pretty
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I chop the plant,
I try and keep the 60 and 60, 60% humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can, but a little warmer than that's
obviously not a huge issue, but just in
[SPEAKER_00]: that range is good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm remembering correctly,
I'm pretty sure what you mentioned as far
[SPEAKER_01]: as temperature and humidity falls within
the ideal VPD range, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got the green, I don't know how
much you know about VPD, but you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: the green optimal range for VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got the yellow, which is kind
of like the tolerance range for VPD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the red, which is kind of out of
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what you mentioned,
lines up with the optimal range or at
[SPEAKER_01]: least in the tolerance range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're probably getting some really
good plant growth there and certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: staying within that VPD range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's going to help maximize
growth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help maximize your overall
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD is very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that obviously if your environment,
if your environment's off at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it can throw off the way your
plant eats, which if your plant's not
[SPEAKER_00]: eating all of the food that you're getting
it, you could have a buildup in your
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, which could have, you know,
lead to more problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cation exchange, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Environment's key.
[SPEAKER_00]: The better environment that you can create
for the plant, the better plant growth
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't mean that we can't get
decent plant growth out of a less than
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the plants are very resilient
and they can, you know, do things to their
[SPEAKER_00]: environment to affect what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a limit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can definitely kill a plant
with, you know, a bad environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where, you know, you'd let the tent get a
little too warm or, you know, when I first
[SPEAKER_00]: got into this, I didn't know like that you
should have a fan exhausting the air out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just threw a light in there
and just hoped it would be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was like, oh, it's a T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: It won't do anything bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to burn my plants,
but you can burn your plants with T5.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have any air exchange,
I'll guarantee you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I fried the crap out of seedlings before
when I first started growing, cause I read
[SPEAKER_01]: on a forum, the more light, the better,
which was not true at all, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: an HID grow light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I burnt the crap out to completely kill
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, um, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, every, uh, every piece of
equipment works as long as you use it
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very easy to misuse any piece,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can do have the most perfect
environment, but then, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're overfeeding or you're over
watering or you're, you know, it's hopped
[SPEAKER_00]: at the wrong time or something and now the
plant has to recover longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can run into problems any,
any which way, but I think the best thing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do is to remember, Hey, I'm only going
to be with this plant for 90 days max,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So like as long, if I have a problem with
this plant, Hey, I just kind of let it go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless it's something I can fix now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, then just worry about it the next
run, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's my best bet is to
keep my stress levels down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's, it's very easy when you're
passionate about these plants to let it
[SPEAKER_00]: get to you and stress you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the happier I am,
the happier my plants generally are.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well said CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of those things where it's just study
after study, after study, proving that
[SPEAKER_01]: increased levels of CO2 helps increase
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing anything to supplement CO2
in the environment at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I was saying, I do use microbes and
microbes breathe out CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to some level, I guess there's a little
bit of CO2 supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through that, but as far as like,
uh, you know, the canisters or the
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom bags or anything, I haven't done
that in that space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I might do it in the four by eight
next, but right now I'm not, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: supplementing any CO2, but it is
definitely, you know, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: more yield when you, when you use a CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like there's only two real things
that I can say that would increase your
[SPEAKER_00]: yield for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's CO2 and a mic, a light mover.
[SPEAKER_01]: Light mover, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in a two by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I wouldn't use it in a two by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: For my four by eight, I was thinking about
throwing a thousand watt onto a light
[SPEAKER_00]: movers that way I can cover both four by
four spaces with that one light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I might be able to pull more yield
from one light in there than I would if I
[SPEAKER_00]: was to throw two 600 Watts in there or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about pest prevention?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't talked about that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people will do things to prevent
pests from invading the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting your grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, personally I've used a few different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, for organics, I really like insect
frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, just kind of helps to keep your plant,
you know, the cell walls get more strong,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they're less likely to be attacked
along with just kind of, uh, the chitin in
[SPEAKER_00]: there kind of triggers a response in the
plant to make it so that their defenses
[SPEAKER_00]: are up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of like a preventative,
uh, if I'm dealing with organics,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, in terms of synthetics, I really only
use one product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called plant therapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's got like some kind of
rubbing alcohol and other mix in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's in it, but I,
once again, I really only use that if I
[SPEAKER_00]: see like damage, like if I see threat
damage or, you know, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: see a bug in there, I'll spray them that
day, but I try not to ever spray in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and I really will only do it once in
veg just to kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: peace of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just want to make sure,
Hey, I didn't see anything, but I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to have a clean slate when I go in
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to deal with it in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had any like major infestations,
was it like fungus gnats or spider mites
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything that you had to battle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, luckily in this two by two,
not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had any major issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I've had problems in the past with,
you know, fungus gnats, uh, white flies,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, in some of the places I've worked at,
I've dealt with aphids or root aphids and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, broad mites, russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've dealt with a lot of different things
along with pathogens like PM and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, bud rot and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my, and my personal grow here at home
now, my plants are usually pretty sturdy
[SPEAKER_00]: once they go into flower and I'm on the
second story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I don't have to worry about
the things crawling into our house that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's less likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So luckily I've, I've been pretty,
pretty bug free in my tent lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's good to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: What other problems have you come across
when growing in such a small space and
[SPEAKER_01]: what did you do to fix those problems?
[SPEAKER_00]: Small space problems really comes down to
when we were talking about environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, I think that's one of the things
I've learned from dealing with nine plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in the one space is that you have to water
them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so putting a lot of extra humidity and
moisture into the room, and your fan's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to exhaust all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes I've had less than ideal
humidity ranges in there where it'll be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a little bit out of the range I
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my usual fix is just open the tent,
let some fresh air get in there and,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, usually works pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the other problems too of a
small space, obviously it's just the
[SPEAKER_00]: height restriction, you know, like I was
looking at, uh, this gorilla glute or
[SPEAKER_00]: gorilla grow tent that was, uh,
I think it's a two by two and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like seven feet tall or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like something like that,
I would have way less problems with height
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, you know, cause in this current
row, if I could have let the plants get
[SPEAKER_00]: just a little bit taller, I probably would
have gotten a much better yield and they
[SPEAKER_00]: probably would have been a lot healthier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because I had to flip it before it
hits that certain height, I ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: having to deal with a smaller plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I would say,
you know, two by two space is great for if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just a single home group,
home grower, you're only growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think that, you know, four to five
ounces every 90 days is a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, you know, buying it at the
store and stuff, you know, you're spending
[SPEAKER_00]: what, like a hundred bucks on an ounce or
something, you know, you figure a two by
[SPEAKER_00]: two tent setups, like 400 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get the whole kid or something,
you know, one cycle and you pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: paid for your whole, whole tent right
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and then every harvest
after that's just, you know, more,
[SPEAKER_00]: more tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you definitely get your money's worth
growing your own heat issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you had any of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's like the number one
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like people growing in small spaces
is they put these led grow lights in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, which some people put in more
powerful than what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, they're running into heat
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that occurred to you at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, is your central air conditioner
that you mentioned that you're using,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that just completely mitigated?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if I were on the light that I have now
at a hundred percent, the hottest it
[SPEAKER_00]: really gets is like 86.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a deal withable,
but if I didn't have that ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: system that checks the environment
constantly with the little sensor,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and I just had to rely on me being
there, then it's, then it's more of an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that AC infinity fan, man,
it makes everything so easy in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: managing your environment that way with
temp and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so far as lighting in the space goes,
uh, I, I know that I've seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of my favorite YouTubers do it where
they'll throw a much more powerful light
[SPEAKER_00]: than the space can really take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen good things come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also seen bad things come from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I guess it's like,
you know, roll the dice if you want,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, don't, don't be mad if
something bad happens, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, I don't even 150 Watts seems
like a little bit too much light for the
[SPEAKER_00]: two by two space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I kind of almost wish I would have
gone with the smaller model and just done
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably would have maybe ran into less
issues, but I was a little overzealous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, ah, I've got two extra inches
to work with on either end.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should be fine, but you know,
we'll see next, next run.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I only do the one plan, I want to see
if I can get it to take the full 150
[SPEAKER_00]: Watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I do that, then I know I probably
be okay, but got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we covered quite a bit of
things that impact you.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing we really didn't talk about
was the genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: As number one, uh, you know, get high
yielding genetics to begin, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to help contribute towards a higher
yield overall, you know, especially in a
[SPEAKER_01]: two by two grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, is there any other advice or
anything you could think of for those
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that are trying to maximize yield
into two by two space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah, I would say the main thing for
me, uh, knowing your space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing how much height you have,
to deal with in terms of how, how high is
[SPEAKER_00]: my light able to go in this space?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, how far away do I have to keep that
light from the canopy?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I will, like I said, I want about
two cubic feet of canopy at any one time,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, to get the maximum yield, I would say,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The most you can really do is three feet,
three cubic feet of canopy space,
[SPEAKER_00]: but any more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like you might end up burning
your tops trying to light up the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to just try and keep it in that
two foot of canopy range with maybe one to
[SPEAKER_00]: one and a half feet of leg to support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that, that's my plant that I want,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the ideal plant shape and size
or canopy shape and size that I want for
[SPEAKER_00]: any space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just recreate that in a two by two
space, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if, uh, if you're in a three by three,
you know, you want 18 cubic feet and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a four by four, you want 32
cubic feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be about where you want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to get your maximum yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they can find me on Instagram right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my main social media outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also have a YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't really have a lot of content.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of just a video log at this
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I would like to do, you know,
more videos like this in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, you know, I like, I like to say it
like this, you know, the only thing I like
[SPEAKER_00]: doing more than growing medicinal plants
is talking about growing medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, something like this is
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just getting to talk to other people about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always a joy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to keep letting it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, hopefully social media will do well
for me and I can make some good
[SPEAKER_00]: connections and just keep talking to
people about this and.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just excited for the future.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, like I mentioned earlier in the
episode, I will have a link to Vince's
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram down in the YouTube description
section below and also link your channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: your YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you'd like, I can link that down there
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people can navigate to your channel and
subscribe to your channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also subscribe to the channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't already every single
weekend, I'm releasing a new garden talk
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast episode, and I'd love for you to
tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vince, thanks so much for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been cool to talk about growing
in a two by two and maximizing the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I haven't grown a two by two,
but I do plan to eventually grow in a two
[SPEAKER_01]: by two right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing in a two by four and a full by
four, but a lot of the things that we
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned today that you mentioned today
can be taken and put into larger growth
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is not only valuable to
those smokes growing in small growth
[SPEAKER_01]: spaces, but a lot of it does go towards
larger growth spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to be able to scale it up if you
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one, man.
