[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into the questions,
thanks to Mars Hydro for sponsoring this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their FC4000 EVO grow light is now
available for pre-order.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the grow lights in their EVO series
have the new Samsung LM301H EVO diodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: which come in at 3.14 micromoles per
joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discount code MRGROWAT10 will give you a
10% discount on any of their EVO lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's valid until October 31st on their
website at mars-hydro.com, and the new
[SPEAKER_00]: FC4000 EVO is on pre-order until October
15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link down in the YouTube
description section below if anyone wants
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had many, many grows in the past
where I just had an unreliable humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to say that in every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very dry climate here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about 30% RH where I live,
so I'm always increasing humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had many humidifiers in the past,
all different brands, and some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately, I've had the same swing
that you've had.
[SPEAKER_00]: 55 up to 70.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if I've set that humidifier to 60%,
65%, whatever I want, you still get that
[SPEAKER_00]: swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through the same exact thing as you
and grew the plant successfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether or not that stresses them out to
the fact that it's going to be a negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impact, some may say it may cause a
hermaphrodite to happen in the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't confirm that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally haven't come across that,
and I don't think there's been any studies
[SPEAKER_00]: in regards to that, but yeah, the stomata
opening is going to obviously change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The intake of the CO2 is going to be
impacted with the up and down,
[SPEAKER_00]: so there certainly will be a negative
impact having that swing, but you're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get a plant that grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could still be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll still get to harvest, and you can
still be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are in that situation to where
things are swinging back and forth like
[SPEAKER_00]: that for you, go ahead and try to continue
to stabilize things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be better, but I wouldn't panic
because I've been there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Been there, done that, and still got to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some seedlings that are in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: When would you think or recommend it would
be okay to start a stash blend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight from the scientist's mouth,
George Mari will give him a shout out.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, as early as possible,
so you can give their first dose as a
[SPEAKER_00]: seedling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some folks are even mixing in stash blend
in the media to begin before they even
[SPEAKER_00]: plant in, and that's a good way to start
the mycorrhizal fungi colony.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using yucca every third
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you use every watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't used yucca in a little while,
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really had the need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually use it when my soil gets just
super dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes between grows, the soil will dry
out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go in and use yucca, but I used to
use every watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used it every other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a whole bunch of things,
and yeah, it's perfectly fine to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing it may hurt is your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're spending money on it and you're
doing it, you're going to use up more,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to need to buy it more
often.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I can see, the only harm it'll
do is on your wallet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can yucca be used in a blue mat res?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it in a blue mat res.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't gunk up the drip lines or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What company do you use to sex your plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a partnership with him for many,
many years now, and he offers my audience
[SPEAKER_00]: a discount.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big shout out to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Discount code MRGROWIT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty fast turnaround.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they receive it, it's within 48
hours, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's usually within 24 hours, but
sometimes within 48 hours, I'll get the
[SPEAKER_00]: results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you ever test for HLVD?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do one test in particular for a
plant that I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a video in the works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so many videos in the works,
and I'm dying to get this thing out,
[SPEAKER_00]: where this plant, looking at it and
showing all the symptoms, not all the
[SPEAKER_00]: symptoms, but showing a lot of symptoms of
hoplite and viroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the samples, send it out for
testing, and then I get the samples back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on a video, so I'm not going
to really tell you what the result is on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to spoil it for you,
but yes, I have done testing, particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: through Farmer Freeman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is foxtailing stress?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it reduce yield?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think some people will say it is stress,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much heat is a form of stress,
and it can cause foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, foxtailing is within some genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some genetics that they foxtail no
matter what, no matter what the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is, but in most cases,
it's usually high temp, at least in my
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I get the foxtailing come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good example of this is I grow curb
stomper a couple different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I grew it out, my temps were
under control, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second time I grew it out, a little bit
more sensitive, and did a foxtailing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it didn't destroy the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess there's different levels of
foxtailing, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just get a couple foxtails come
out of it, or you get the whole bud have
[SPEAKER_00]: foxtailing come out at all different
angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still had dense bud structure with
foxtails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality was still there, and therapists
was still there, and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as reducing yield, I would say no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it does any reduction in
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some may say it actually increases yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see somebody saying that since
there's more bud development happening
[SPEAKER_00]: during that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a really good question
though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recommendation for an organic dry
amendment nutrient line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to use earth dust nutrients by the
Green Sunshine Company, and I had some
[SPEAKER_00]: good root success once I figured out how
to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, I wasn't keeping the medium
moist enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: As many of you know, when you're growing
organically, keeping the medium moist at
[SPEAKER_00]: all times is important, so the amendments
can break down and be turned into usable
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earth Dust, unfortunately, that company
went under.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a Green Sunshine Company that's
no longer being sold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over to Kraft Blend by Build of
Soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great success with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several years I've been running Kraft
Blend for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So easy to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I did was one cup per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that was back when I was using seven
gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would do is amend the soil begin
with one cup, then every 30 days from
[SPEAKER_00]: there, do a top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 30 days into veg, which usually for me,
since I'm growing small to medium sized
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, 30 days in veg is right before
flipping the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hit it with a top dressing,
one cup per plant, then 30 days into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if I'm growing a longer flowering
cultivar or something that's like 11,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12, 13 weaker, I'll hit it again at day
60.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or so with another top dressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's an eight week or nine week,
I'll just do that one top dress and get
[SPEAKER_00]: day 30.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initial amending right before flipping
the flower, which is usually around day 30
[SPEAKER_00]: or 40 of veg for me, then 30 days into
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've done experiments to where I do
every 15 days instead of every 30 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: every 20 days instead of every 30 days,
every 40 days instead of every 30 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten some mixed results there for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every 30 days has worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me in particular, same exact thing
with Tad Hussey's Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something I've used my last grow
for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kiss Organics nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nutrient pack as well as a Kraft Blend
is just a one parter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes things so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have a, it's not a formula for
veg and then a separate formula for bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one that you feed throughout,
which makes it so much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Kraft Blend is like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tad Hussey's Kiss Organics nutrient pack
is like that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, great success with that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recommend it and I'm going to continue
to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two organic dry nutrient
lines that I can recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there really much of a difference with
new lights other than the best efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what you mean by the second
part of the question there, but I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: answer the first part of the question,
which is, is there must have a difference
[SPEAKER_00]: with these new lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in my opinion, and we're
actually going to do a full from the stash
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast episode on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me, Rob Higgins for 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going to talk about this topic
in particular, grow light technology and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's kind of flatlined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't really changed a whole lot in
the past couple years, a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as light spread across the
canopy, a lot of these lights are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar results.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks right now, what they're
going to, what they're doing is they're
[SPEAKER_00]: just going after the cheapest light.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so if they have, you see
Infinity, Spider Farmer, Mars Hydro in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind that the toss up between those three,
they're really just going with what the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest one is because they're all
similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Light spread, similar efficiency,
similar power output.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These days it's grow light technology has
kind of gotten a little boring.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least to me, everything is so similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's not much advancements
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest event advancement that's happened
in grow light technology this year has
[SPEAKER_00]: been the Evo diode, a little bit more
efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love the question and we'll have a full
length podcast episode on from the stash
[SPEAKER_00]: at some point in the future from Hawaii is
60 to 70%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity too much for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the VPD chart,
not sure if you're familiar with the VPD
[SPEAKER_00]: or not Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a couple of different charts
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go with the pulse VPD charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you search pulse VPD chart,
you should see three different charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to be for seedlings.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is going to be for flowering and then
one is going to be for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually the seedlings is also seedling
clones and you'll see that you can totally
[SPEAKER_00]: get away with 60, 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll just have to run a little bit
higher of temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on which stage of growth you're
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of hard for me to talk about
it, but 60, 70%, even through flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten away with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest concern for that is the bud
rot in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you're in veg, biggest concern
for high humidity is powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So real good air circulation in there,
make sure things are moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The air is moving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to help prevent powdery
mildew and bud rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, making sure that your
canopy isn't too thick with leaves so air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow can get in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are some things that if you are
running up humidity in that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep an eye out for, and you should be
fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a need for your plants to fade at
the end of flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some plants are going to naturally fade at
the end, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feed nutrients all the way up until
the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not get a fade at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you'll feed nutrients all the
way up to the end and you'll get a fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people flush whether or not you
believe in flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can help bring out a fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you need a fade at the end of the
flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I got a couple cultivars right
now that aren't fading at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be harvesting them within,
they're actually day 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they're going to go another
week, no, another two weeks, maybe a max,
[SPEAKER_00]: no fade happening on them whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as a need to fade, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mistake I think a lot of new
growers make is they think that the fade
[SPEAKER_00]: has to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They panic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they get up to what they think
is harvest and they don't see a fade on
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants and then they flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden buds are
overripe, bananas start coming out,
[SPEAKER_00]: pollinating the other plants that are
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like pushing your plants longer than
normal because you're not getting a fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch out for that because I've had that
happen to me before, actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that you needed that fade,
you know, once upon a time, many years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago, I thought that every plant needed a
fade and that's just not correct at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had plants that unfortunately Nanner
started popping out, pollinated all the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that were in the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some plants that were in early
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those got pollinated, so no bueno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excess nitrogen in flowering causes poor
buds, bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Read it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: If yes, is it hard to control?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's grow science.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not bro science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, excess nitrogen in flowering can
cause airier buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause, you'll get like a growth
spurt happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Weeks two, three and beyond, you'll see
like the tops of the plants will kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: grow even more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've ruined crops because of excess
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've told this story before, but I had
four by four tent full of blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: overfed nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought everything was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was way back, way, way back and
overfed them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got into week four or five flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, these buds don't look right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like really airy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like any of my past grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to find out it was me just
overfeeding too much nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that was a contributing
factor was Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag, along with my base nutrients,
Cal Mag has, most Cal Mag has nitrogen in
[SPEAKER_00]: it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just your calcium magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have nitrogen in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have iron in it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really got to be careful on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made that mistake in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people still make that mistake
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could certainly get poor buds in
flowering due to excess nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If yes, is it hard to control in organics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not as common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I don't really get, you know,
I'll get some darker leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems like it's like on the verge of
nitrogen toxicity, but I've never had like
[SPEAKER_00]: bad bud structure due to too much nitrogen
when I'm giving organic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can absolutely overdo organic
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you seen the auto pot tray yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: Really want a few with aggressive fabric.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm anxious to get one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what the size is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see what the dimensions were,
like how big of a bed it actually is,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that looks like it's going to be
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get my hands on that and try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your honest experience in Dr.
Bugby's class?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it two years in a row.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he continues it, I will continue to do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those that don't know Dr. Bruce
Bugby over at Utah State University,
[SPEAKER_00]: he has a course every fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been doing it for the past couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: First it was like 40 different
presentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now there's well over 60,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't quote me on that, but there's a ton
of different presentations on all aspects
[SPEAKER_00]: of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For beginners, I think it's a little bit
too advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's real deep into the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine this going over a lot of
people's heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: The course isn't active right now,
or actually it might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in October now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he activate it again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I need to sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If he activated that again, usually he
activates it in September, I believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would recommend it for those that
are intermediate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or advanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a beginner, it might go over
your head.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to learn the bare bone
basics to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if you really want to advance
things, definitely take that course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a cannabis cultivation certificate
from Utah State University and I passed
[SPEAKER_00]: and I have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely, definitely recommend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is considered a successful grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think success is different for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for some people, just getting to
harvest is a success, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there were so many things that could
go wrong throughout the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get pest infestation and then
have to wipe all your grow because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's just so much out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could just have a lack of nutrition
and your plants could just be dying out
[SPEAKER_00]: and you want to start over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not successful there, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for a lot of people,
just getting to harvest, especially with
[SPEAKER_00]: the new growers, I know when I first
started growing, I just wanted to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there was some yellow leaves on there
by harvest, whatever, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as I was able to get some buds to
smoke at the end, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But my definition of a successful harvest
is a plant that is healthy throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire grow and getting to harvest as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty short answer on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's your definition of a successful
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to know that in the comment
section below, because I think it's for
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we're going to get a lot of
different responses on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people have a feeling are
going to mention flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're going to mention the
cannabinoid content, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be considered successful if
they got what they were looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I think it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really good question.
