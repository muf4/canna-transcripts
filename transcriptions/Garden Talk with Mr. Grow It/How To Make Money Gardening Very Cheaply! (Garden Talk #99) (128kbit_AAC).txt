[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil is the most important thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have good soil, I don't have
good crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I treat my soil extremely well and try
to help it be as nutritious as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: My tomato plant roots will feed on the
microbes from the cover crop plantings
[SPEAKER_01]: that still, the roots are still on the
ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be dead, but there's still life
down there eating and surviving and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a huge, huge cover crop fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm building my soil legitimately every
single year for them, adding more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: soil to cover cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets better and the yields go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know our mechanic, we know our
doctor, we know the guy at Foot Locker
[SPEAKER_01]: that sells our shoes by name, but we don't
know who grows the food that we put in our
[SPEAKER_01]: body, and most of all, our kids' body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just back-ass words to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, aka Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast, this episode

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Michael Bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a very large garden,
and you actually grow plants for your
[SPEAKER_00]: local community, and you make money while
doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you reached out to me and asked to be
on the podcast, I was inspired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I commend you for what you're doing,
and for you wanting to come on and spread
[SPEAKER_00]: your message to inspire others.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dive into the details of
your garden and how you go about making
[SPEAKER_00]: money from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I own Dallas Half Acre Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little less than a half acre piece
of property right outside of Dallas,
[SPEAKER_01]: Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't live on the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just strictly my farm, where I raise
a few chickens and quail.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a miniature farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I call it, just a farm scaled
down to a half acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing it seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting in January will be my seventh
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow seasonal vegetables for families
and people in my neighborhood and at
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that wants to buy them,
I'll sell them to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do restaurants or grocery stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's directly to the families and the
people that I know that want to buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seasonal vegetables is right now going
into the fall here in Dallas winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a salad mix, kale, carrots,
small onions, about the size of a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: or a golf ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people eat them for the greens
instead of the actual onions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I've got a little bit of cilantro
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just anything that you think of during the
winter, I grow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then come spring, I move into salads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow salad year round here in Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can do that pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I do tomatoes, peppers, a little bit
of cantaloupe if I have the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just stuff that you think of in a seasonal
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just make it a little bit bigger and
then I'm able to sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different plants that you grow
for different times of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all seasonal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow carrots in the middle of the
summer because they don't taste as good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow tomatoes during the winter
because obviously the frost and the freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Texas kills them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just basic what you would think of a
backyard garden, except there's a few
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques I do to increase my yield and
overall profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine the folks that are looking to do
this as well, determining a place to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you determine if the space you are
looking to plant in receives enough
[SPEAKER_00]: sunlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I picked my property that I bought
now, I went out there four or five times
[SPEAKER_01]: just to see where the sun was at different
times of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously here in Texas, the summers are
brutal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 110 for weeks, between 100 and 110
for four to five, six weeks on end.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my context, I want evening shade.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I can get that morning sun up to three
or four o'clock and then I've got a nice
[SPEAKER_01]: tree line or something off to the west to
get me some shade, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need as much sunlight as possible for
the growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on your area, if I'm in
Minnesota, I don't really care if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: having a west shade or not because it
doesn't get that hot there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want maximum sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to take into context your
temperature and your amount of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us a little bit deeper about your
half acre that you're gardening on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe you're growing all in beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What plants do you have growing where?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually grow in three 130 foot long,
14 foot wide caterpillar tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're seven foot six in the middle and
they're shaped like a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're made out of poles that are bent
into a tunnel shape every five feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got eight mil plastic on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the winter, I can close everything
down and hold in that heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the summer, I can raise the plastic
up a good five or six feet on the side and
[SPEAKER_01]: then take the end walls down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got good airflow going every which
direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: That allows me to plant summer crops
earlier because in Texas, we usually get a
[SPEAKER_01]: frost around Easter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I plant my tomatoes spring break.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plant them three to four weeks earlier
than what I could is if I didn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in the fall, I just lost all my
tomato plants last week because it got
[SPEAKER_01]: down to the low 30s for five or six hours
a night, four nights in a row and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: shocked them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas last year, I had tomatoes selling
at Christmas because we never got that
[SPEAKER_01]: cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some years I can have them for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some years like this year, it was just
kind of a free deal with getting that cold
[SPEAKER_01]: snap real early.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does grow under the tunnels help
tremendously.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also protects them from the rain,
which you think plants don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: protection from the rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're growing lettuce and even
tomatoes, what happens is in the summer
[SPEAKER_01]: here in Texas, you'll get a thunderstorm
and it'll rain a quarter of an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: An hour later, it's 105.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the humidity is 95% and it's pure
hell on earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those leaves on that lettuce are wet and
it's 95 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a fungus and you lose everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas growing under my tunnels,
that plastic protects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything stays dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps in regards to that quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you understand the context of the
tunnels, yes, I grow in raised beds about
[SPEAKER_01]: six to eight inches tall because my soil
is so bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like concrete during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Swamp during the fall and the winter
because it's so wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just bought a bunch of one by six cedar
boards and made beds that are three foot
[SPEAKER_01]: wide and 50 foot long inside my tunnels
and gave me a little walkway every 50 foot
[SPEAKER_01]: to get in and out of the tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Filled them up with compost and my
amendments that I put in there depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on what exact plant I'm putting in there
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Off to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't till.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've ever heard the
phrase no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like no till.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never till my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with the fertility and in Texas
it gets so dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps a ton.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil never gets compacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't walk on my beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never get compacted.
[SPEAKER_01]: My beds are three foot wide.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to walk on my beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: To harvest anything I can get everything
from one side and then I can walk around
[SPEAKER_01]: and do everything on the other side and
reach to the middle when I go from both
[SPEAKER_01]: sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: My soil is the most important thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't have good soil I don't have
good crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I treat my soil extremely well and try to
help it be as nutritious as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely want to get deeper into this
soil and how you do the amending and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth but I do want to ask about
the tunnels first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically how much does it cost to
build out those tunnels?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's two main companies that you can
get them from.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is Farmers Friend and it says
FarmersFriendLLC.com and then there's
[SPEAKER_01]: another company called Bootstrap Farmer
and they both sell to small scale farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: like me and they just send you the kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got a 10 minute video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both of them have 10 minute videos on how
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really easy to put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can put one up in about four hours by
myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't recommend it but most of the shit
that I do I have to do by myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible and I'll be honest with you
I haven't gotten a quote on a tunnel in a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years because I don't need any
more but I think at 50 footers around
[SPEAKER_01]: $1,200.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to break the bank but it's
definitely something you should be serious
[SPEAKER_01]: about before you go to spend the money but
they do last an extremely long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the same plastic now going on
seven seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably have to replace it after
this season but it's paid for itself very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it can be extremely
valuable and pretty much needed for
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody like you where you have those
swings in the environment like you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone that I talk to about this I ask
them, are you serious or you just want to
[SPEAKER_01]: try it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they say, I just want to try it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, okay, wait until spring,
try it for three or four months and then
[SPEAKER_01]: if you love it, spend the money and buy
you a tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're dead serious right now,
spend your money on a tunnel first and
[SPEAKER_01]: then buy the other stuff that you think
you need because you just can't grow year
[SPEAKER_01]: round without the tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to make money doing this,
you can't take off four months out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year and not grow anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preparing the soil for planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people will amend the soil with
fertilizer to begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you mentioned your organic no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do to the soil in order to
prepare for planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: First thing I take into account is what am
I planting?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm planting tomatoes in this
three-foot wide bed, I'm going to put in
[SPEAKER_01]: different amendments that I'm going to do
if I'm going to put in lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grow a lot of salad mix on my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm just doing salad mix, the most
important thing is nitrogen and the
[SPEAKER_01]: organic forms of nitrogen that I prefer to
use on my farm is soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a box of it for 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's five pounds in it and a
box lasts me four or five months.
[SPEAKER_01]: That amendment is really cheap and I just
sprinkle it all over the bed before I
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and then rake it into the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The most important amendment that I use is
worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know what worm
castings are, they're worm shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds gross, but it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy down in Plannersville,
Texas, down by Houston.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pretty much the smartest man alive
when it comes to worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all have our own hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: His hobby is worms and making the most
nutritious worm castings there is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has other worm castings tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: He'll buy them with his own money and test
them just to make sure his are still
[SPEAKER_01]: higher grade than everyone else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: He loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a wealth of knowledge and I buy a
thousand pounds from him twice a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I do is usually a five gallon bucket
every 15 feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: On a 50 foot bed, I'll put three,
three and a half, five gallon buckets,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about, I don't know, 60,
70 pounds worth of worm castings into that
[SPEAKER_01]: bed and then just rake it in like I do the
soybean meal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worm castings, if you're anywhere
close to Houston, like Louisiana,
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma, Arkansas, New Mexico,
it's worth a drive down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You buy a thousand pound bag, big old tote
sack.
[SPEAKER_01]: He puts it in the back of your truck with
a tractor and you drive off with it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you go home and unload it however you want
to unload it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're by far the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually done accidental tests when I
plant tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig a hole, of course, and then I put
worm castings and some organic fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I forget to put the worm
castings in the hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, two weeks later I can go back and I
can see, shit, I didn't put worm castings
[SPEAKER_01]: in that one because that tomato plant's
two feet shorter than all my other tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a massive difference and
it's all because of the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done every test that I can do by
myself just to try it out and every time
[SPEAKER_01]: they proved to be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really can't talk about them enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I use worm castings in my garden for
my medicinal plants and it makes a huge
[SPEAKER_00]: difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely makes a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the microbes on there as well,
which will help break down any other
[SPEAKER_00]: organic matter that you add into the
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, can't speak enough about worm
castings, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you starting these plants indoors
and then letting them grow for a little
[SPEAKER_00]: while, maybe under a grow light and then
transferring them to your outdoor garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are you just planting directly into
your outdoor beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I start indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a tough shed in my backyard because
my wife was getting really pissed because
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so many lettuce plants and
everything growing in my house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I splurged and bought me a 10 by 10
tough shed and insulated it and I've got a
[SPEAKER_01]: six, four foot wide, six foot tall grow
racks from Lowe's that has some LED lights
[SPEAKER_01]: that I start everything from indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously root crops, carrots,
beets, radishes, those get started direct
[SPEAKER_01]: seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most everything else is transplanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lettuce, tomatoes, some of the greens like
Red Russian Carol are charred,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just direct sow into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: But probably 75% of my farm is started in
my tough shed in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then depending on the date,
how many days it is since I planted them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I transplant them into my farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask how long do you let
them grow indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just before you transplant outdoors?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously tomatoes, I usually start around
Christmas and I'll transplant March 1st
[SPEAKER_01]: because I like really big tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good 12 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas lettuce is 21 to 24 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just depends on the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, salad is usually 21 to 24
days, maybe 26, but anything over 26 tends
[SPEAKER_01]: to get too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I transplant it, it goes into
kind of a shock and I lose the bigger
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually lose time by letting the
plants get bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when you do plant them into your
outdoor garden, forgot to ask,
[SPEAKER_00]: are you using any cover crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some folks will use cover crops and
grow along with their plants or some folks
[SPEAKER_00]: will do cover crops between grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any of that at all or no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge cover crop fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you've heard of Gabe
Brown, but he's a regenerative farmer up
[SPEAKER_01]: in North Dakota or South Dakota.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's got five principles for soil
health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I follow all five of those,
you know, religiously just to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cover crop is, you know, does two of
the five things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always has a root in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So during the winter, like in my tomato,
I caught my tomato tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I grow most of my tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's covered in a 13 seeded
winter grass cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about three or four inches high now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the spring around the end of
February, March 1st, I'll tarp it,
[SPEAKER_01]: kill it real good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll pull that dead grass back,
dig a hole, plant my tomato plants right
[SPEAKER_01]: into the to the dead cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that cover crop acts as a mulch for my
tomatoes all summer, which helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: retained moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my tomato plant roots will feed
on the microbes from the cover crop
[SPEAKER_01]: plantings.
[SPEAKER_01]: The roots are still in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may be dead, but there's still life
down there eating and surviving and
[SPEAKER_01]: helping each other out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a huge, huge cover crop fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulch layers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you use any of those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't use cover crops on my lettuce
beds because the cover crop tends to not
[SPEAKER_01]: die perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I go to harvest lettuce,
I've got wheatgrass or hairy veg,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever my cover crop was, growing inside
my lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it makes it so tedious to sit there
and pick out every little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of using a cover crop on my
lettuce beds, I use wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a place two miles from my farm
that sells a pickup load for 10 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I go down there quite often and get
wood chips and put them everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll mulch with wood chips,
especially during the summer, because it
[SPEAKER_01]: just keeps the ground cooler and moisture
retention and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many benefits to mulching.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it sounds like you're getting
everything just about locally,
[SPEAKER_00]: huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is local?
[SPEAKER_01]: Except the worm castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, everything else is local.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, my compost is three miles
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wood chips is two miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: My house is four miles away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've started your plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've grown them to a certain point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You transfer them to your outdoor beds
that are mended with the fertilizer that
[SPEAKER_00]: it needs for that particular type of
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the plant's growing, what type of
organic inputs are you adding in
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when do you add them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So lettuce, the greens, I don't add
anything because they grow so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll transplant them in at 24 or 25
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And during the spring, fall, and summer,
when the days are a little bit longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: you get more sunlight, I'll harvest at day
50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're literally in the ground three
to four weeks before I harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lettuce isn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other plants, the fruit-bearing
plants, tomatoes, peppers, zucchini,
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, I found this stuff at my
local nursery here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get it from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't make it, but it's got like bat
guano, molasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a list of like 20
different things that are completely
[SPEAKER_01]: organic that they figured out some
combination to put together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it comes in a gallon jug, and then you
dilute that into a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about once every two to three weeks,
I'll spend a few hours and go through
[SPEAKER_01]: seven or eight gallons of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: After I dilute it, seven or eight gallons,
maybe a half the jug, and deep water that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff into the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell three to four days later,
there's more blooms, they're healthier,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're greener, they're darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're really struggling, I'll do it
once a week, and then maybe back off to
[SPEAKER_01]: every two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just go by observation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a great amendment to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really lucky to have found it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means $25 for a gallon, and I would
probably use three gallons for the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you about that next.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about watering?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have such a huge area that you
have a garden on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your watering routine?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's drip tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's on drip tape from Drip Depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comes with a kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have 14 foot wide tunnels.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a 15 foot, I call it the main
hose, a 15 foot strip of main hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes across the length of the bed that
has a water hose hook up to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each bed, depending on what I grow,
like lettuce, I can get four rows of
[SPEAKER_01]: lettuce and a three foot bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got four drip lines that the
lettuce is planted right next to every
[SPEAKER_01]: dripping meter, which is eight inches
apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a dripping meter,
there's a lettuce plant right next to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the hose, out of the
main hose, where the drip tape connects,
[SPEAKER_01]: has a, I don't know what you want to call
it, a faucet nozzle that you can turn that
[SPEAKER_01]: specific line off or on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I decide to grow something that's
not every eight inches or I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: four beds, I just turn that drip line off
and turn the drip line on if I'm growing
[SPEAKER_01]: tomatoes per se.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need four lines of water if I've
got one row of tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all on drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just turn it on and the
biggest thing is observation, knowing when
[SPEAKER_01]: to water and when not to water and how
long to water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than just observation,
you just turn it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be saving a ton of labor hours by
having that automated watering system
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine some people are listening to
this and they're like, wow, it's a massive
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You must be spending all day long in your
garden, just managing your plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be feeding or watering or so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you spend in your garden each
day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Four hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four to five hours, four to five hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I could spend more, but I have a
family and I don't think I even told you
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually a full-time teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found this farming thing seven years ago
and I didn't know how it was going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, you know what, I'm going to
try it, fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually figured out I'm pretty good at
it and it makes pretty good money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm too close to retirement from
teaching.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the way teachers work in Texas,
you work 24, 25 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 years and then you get a percentage of
your salary for the rest of your life for
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm like 38 years away and then I get
$3,000 a month for the rest of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not going to leave doing that when
I'm this close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually farm part-time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell everybody I'm a full-time farmer
and a part-time teacher because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: way I feel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do so much stuff at the farm and
I actually do so much stuff at school for
[SPEAKER_01]: my farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like during lunch, I'm planting seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: On my conference period, I'm on the phone
talking to people or scheduling pickups
[SPEAKER_01]: and deliveries or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I work from 4.30 in the morning to
seven o'clock in the morning at the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I go to school and then at night or
on the weekends, I'll get in another few
[SPEAKER_01]: hours here and there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It averages out to four to five hours a
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I read in one of your other
interviews, like in the caption or
[SPEAKER_00]: wherever that you're a PE teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach elementary PE K through five.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother-in-law is also a PE teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody's like, oh, that's the
easiest job ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, come and spend eight hours with
300 screaming kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I don't have to grade papers
and do lesson plans too much, but I have
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 screaming kids for eight hours a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not all rainbows and sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back onto plants, I did want to
actually talk about pest prevention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have such a large space that
you're gardening on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine that sometimes you have to
deal with pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do to prevent pests from
occurring?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you ever had any infestations that
you had to battle that you can talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two arch nemesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was God for a day, I would destroy
them forever and they never walk the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet again.
[SPEAKER_01]: This type of worm, it's actually a moth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what a moth is before it transforms
into a moth, just a worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gets down in the middle of your
lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it there because it's usually
moist, warm, or cool during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool during the summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just eat your lettuce from the inside
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know that it's there until half
your lettuce is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spring and fall are the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: During spring and fall, I'm literally
digging pretty much in every lettuce plant
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for one, because if there's one,
three days later, there'll be thousands.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things you want to stay
on top of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can spray it in your mouth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually did it just to make sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't kill the worm.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it actually does is it makes the
worm's mouth too sticky to open up and
[SPEAKER_01]: then it starts to death.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a pesticide.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like a glue, but it's completely
safe for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the only spray that I use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the other pest that I fight
continuously with is hornworms for tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big fat green worms that have the
horns sticking out, they will destroy a
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato plant in two days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had them real bad in the middle of
October.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost 30% of my tomatoes to hornworms,
but the weather conditions were perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way, you can't even spray
anything for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally have to just sit there and
pick them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Luckily, they're not that hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get a black light and they glow in
the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very fluorescent color at
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I take my kids out there and
say, here's a dollar for every one that
[SPEAKER_01]: you find or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the two that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything else, I've learned if you
create spaces for the pest predators,
[SPEAKER_01]: they take care of them, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Gabe Brown, I mentioned earlier,
he said that he heard a scientist say
[SPEAKER_01]: there's 1,700 beneficial insects for one
pest, but you have to give them the
[SPEAKER_01]: environment to thrive in for them to go
search.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why monocrop is so bad for farming
because there's no place for the good pest
[SPEAKER_01]: to live.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of my bed, I might have a
three-foot raised box on top of my raised
[SPEAKER_01]: bed that's just got flowers in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salvia and marigolds and different stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks completely insane because it's
right in the middle of the zucchini.
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff that eats the squash bugs,
which is usually a bad problem for people
[SPEAKER_01]: with zucchini and squash, those good
insects live in that flower, little group
[SPEAKER_01]: of flowers right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cover crops are the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not mowing your cover crop gives those
beneficial insects a home to live when you
[SPEAKER_01]: need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much companion planting as
well that you're utilizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any other companion plants that
you have besides the ones you just
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not so much companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what fits in that empty spot in the
ground that I can grow and make money off
[SPEAKER_01]: of.
[SPEAKER_01]: My tomatoes get up to 10 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever heard of lean and lower?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when your tomato plants get so damn
tall, you can't reach the top of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trellis my tomato plants on one string
straight up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they get so tall, you unravel some
string at the top and you lower them and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they lean like this and then they
start to grow up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all this space down here,
there's nothing there because I pruned
[SPEAKER_01]: that to keep fungus and disease and stuff
off the tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go in and I'll plant radishes or
bees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or lettuce or whatever I can think of that
I know I can sell that I need to get in
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll plant underneath those tomato plants,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't hurt anything, but I don't know
if you call it companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like make money planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you've gone through the entire
grow process.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't deal with any pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took away your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, harvesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you go about harvesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically get for yields?
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salad, I sell in a Ziploc one-gallon
Ziploc bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get DMs all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're losing too much money buying Ziploc
bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should use the Uline one-gallon bags
with the tie.
[SPEAKER_01]: My customers like the Ziploc bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll spend an extra 10 cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I'm getting off on a tangent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Ziploc bag is six heads of lettuce.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sell it for five bucks, just to give you
an idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I plant four rows every eight inches.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could get into the math and tell you
real dork numbers, but just on basis,
[SPEAKER_01]: on a 50-foot bed, I make $500 every eight
weeks on average.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the summer, it's every six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: During the fall and the winter,
it's $10,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 12 weeks because stuff just doesn't
grow as fast, but it's very easy to get
[SPEAKER_01]: five crops, five to six crops of lettuce
out of one bed in a 12-month time period.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can usually get about $500 for that
bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can do the math.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomatoes, it just depends on the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could spend an hour telling you about
it, but the easiest way I can tell you is
[SPEAKER_01]: once you're set up, profit margin is so
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't even imagine because the worm
castings you pay for, the seed's cheap as
[SPEAKER_01]: hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main thing is your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people all the time, I don't even
know what to pay myself hourly wage
[SPEAKER_01]: because I would do it for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I never made another dime, I'd still
farm just the way I do now just because I
[SPEAKER_01]: love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The profit margins are insane when you can
quit buying stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to buy another tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to make more beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get your farm into a machine,
it's probably 80% profit margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot to get it to that point,
but when you do, as long as you don't do
[SPEAKER_01]: something stupid or tornado hits or
something and screws everything up,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a well-oiled machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do boom, boom, boom, wait three weeks
and then do it all over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially once you get that soil right,
the first time you use the soil is one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, but year after year after year as
that soil is getting better and better and
[SPEAKER_00]: better with all the microbes in there and
the nutrition that's in there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got to be getting better and better
crops each year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The limits that I have that I put in,
they don't get used every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The soybean mill, I can dig down in there
and I can see soybean mill from a year
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a yellow color.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The warm castings are still there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I put the triple tin fertilizer,
which isn't organic and I never use it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if I did, that should be gone in a
month or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then my soil is fried from too much
nitrogen and phosphorus and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say it actually gets better,
I'm building my soil legitimately every
[SPEAKER_01]: single year because I'm adding more
castings, more soybean mill, cover
[SPEAKER_01]: cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just gets better and the yields go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes your plant stronger.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fights off disease and bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more than just yield that you're
counting on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saving money by not having to buy
more stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: After you've grown the plant and harvested
them, you talked a little bit about this
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning, but how do you go about
selling the produce that you've grown?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm different from probably every other
farmer that does what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad they're there for farmers,
but I hate them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have all my products sold before I
harvest it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, that right there is my customer
list.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I go off of.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look, I have week A and week B.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week A, I deliver to this group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Week B, I deliver to this group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, why do you have two weeks?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most people can't eat or don't
want to eat all that produce in one week
[SPEAKER_01]: and then boom, have it again on Sunday.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only so much zucchini you can eat
during the summer, but if they eat it one
[SPEAKER_01]: week and then they do something else the
next week, by Friday or Saturday that next
[SPEAKER_01]: week, they're like, oh, Mike's bringing me
his basket tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: That basket has salad, zucchini,
tomatoes, beets, green beans in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're ready for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like I was saying, keep them wanting
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a few customers that I sell to
every single week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I got two people up there that I
sell to every single week because they're
[SPEAKER_01]: vegetarians.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work out great, but if you ever
start, people out there, if you ever
[SPEAKER_01]: start, at least consider doing two
different weeks of customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want a customer to say,
I can't wait to get your stuff as opposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to, oh crap, you're bringing me more
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be wanted, not like a hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you find the customers to begin
with and then how do you do the
[SPEAKER_00]: communication with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it through an email list or is it all
individual or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a whole lot of communication
anymore because they know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know, I'm going to drop it off at
this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in a subdivision in a little town
outside of Dallas and there's 600 homes in
[SPEAKER_01]: my subdivision and it's a fairly well-off
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know on Sunday evening, I'm bringing
in their stuff and I just drive around,
[SPEAKER_01]: drop off the baskets in my neighborhood
and then a lot of my customers are
[SPEAKER_01]: teachers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that's starting, that's thinking
about doing this, teachers are the very
[SPEAKER_01]: best customer you could ever have if
you're selling salad mix because they only
[SPEAKER_01]: get 30 minutes for lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have time to heat anything up
really.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than likely, they're trying to lose a
few pounds or at least eat healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salad's the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them they can have a fruit salad on
Monday, they can have egg white salads on
[SPEAKER_01]: Tuesday, tuna salad on Wednesday,
chicken salad on Thursday and a nut salad
[SPEAKER_01]: on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's five completely salads,
you take it to them on Monday,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's literally the easiest sell in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if teachers or grade, anywhere that,
there's a lot of people, hospitals,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I delivered to one hospital because
there's like 10 nurses that buy from me.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in the, I went blank,
baby ward, pregnancy, going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all in that floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that called, bud?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll put you on the spot now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, you know what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nurses are always busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just like teachers, they got 30
minutes, if that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want something quick, healthy,
fast, tasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I always harvest Sunday morning,
I harvest Sunday night, I deliver or
[SPEAKER_01]: Monday morning, I deliver.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's literally 24 hours old at the most
as opposed to you buy a salad at the
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store and everyone's like,
why's my salad going by?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only day three.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not day three, it's day 12 because it
is harvested in California, packaged in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it in a warehouse before it got
shipped to Dallas from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Set it in the back of Walmart.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day eight or nine, it finally got on the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day nine or 10, you bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Day 12, it's earned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the way our supply system
works, which is completely stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you buy mine, it was 24 hours
old.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or not even mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone that grows local is 24 hours old.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had people put it in the back of
their fridge and their kids put stuff in
[SPEAKER_01]: front of it and then they pull it out and
spend two weeks and they eat it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's as fresh as it was the day after
I gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The freshness is unmatched.
[SPEAKER_00]: I locally here, I have Green Life Produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, getting it right after harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting it probably within 24 hours
and it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than anything I've ever bought from
a store.
[SPEAKER_01]: My teachers told me to put crack in my
salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tell them that I'm a crack eater and
I accidentally put crack in it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so addicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to ask, for your half acre
garden, that you're growing plants on,
[SPEAKER_00]: how many customers are you supplying?
[SPEAKER_01]: During the summer when stuff grows so much
faster, I would do 40 a week pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's 40 baskets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a basket, like I said, is usually 15
to 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to give people an idea of the math,
I charge $5 for salad and $2.50 for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tomatoes are $2.50, which is too cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be $3.50.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I also charge $2.50 for beets,
which is too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it averages out and then it's just
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've never had anyone complain about
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people actually, if I tell them this
week is 15 bucks, they usually just give
[SPEAKER_01]: me 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I also deliver to their door.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I started, I said, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon just bought Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon's gonna be delivering stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they got, COVID hit, Walmart started
delivering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, I have to deliver too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I changed my focus around of marketing
and started marketing really close to my
[SPEAKER_01]: house or my school or my work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally everybody that I sell to,
I can be there within, they're probably
[SPEAKER_01]: within a mile of my house or my school.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works really well that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can imagine it's super rewarding
supplying the folks around you with the
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I've had people cry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not because it was so good,
but because like one lady, her husband
[SPEAKER_01]: worked for TruGreen for 25 years and now
has Parkinson's disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously nobody can prove it,
but she swears it was because of working
[SPEAKER_01]: for TruGreen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she doesn't want to feed her grandkids
that come over stuff from the supermarket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even if it says organic at the
supermarket, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or the organic label has been so watered
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm not certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can kiss my ass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have absolutely no respect for that
organic label anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's lobbyist has said,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can slide this in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, hydroponics or aquaponics is
certified organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please tell me how that can be organic
when all you use is chemicals to feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my soapbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you want to piss me off,
bring up organically, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get a little far.
[SPEAKER_01]: But back to the whole thing was the lady,
like Lily Crott, she's like, I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for this for so long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't grow anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to go and feed my
grandkids something because I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: them to end up like my husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally she's like, just got tears
coming down her eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was super rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've got people that be like,
oh, you've got to try Mike's salad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the salad guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if somebody meets me that knows of my
salad, they're like, you're the salad guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm the salad guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's me I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this is super rewarding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's inspiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, what we just went over in
this episode, how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are going to enjoy
listening to your story and realize that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think a lot of people think
about urban gardening and think about
[SPEAKER_00]: supplying people locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think that it's going to cost a
bunch of money to get started.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's going to cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a ton of time doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you just explained there,
that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get started cheaply.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now co-courses, investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the tunnel and stuff over time,
but that'll pay for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds very, very possible the way that
you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really glad that you decided to
come on here and share your story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have a few more questions for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is a question that you
actually wanted me to ask you,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is why do you think urban farming is
going to be important in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, COVID taught us so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with the war, you know,
overseas and basically everything just
[SPEAKER_01]: falling apart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the supply chain is such a joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that we have to go to Whole
Foods or Sprouts, and I don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: many people do this, but I look and see
where stuff comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why in the hell we buy beets that are
grown in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: As an example, because I just saw a label
the other day that said made in Mexico on
[SPEAKER_01]: a beet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's worried about the climate
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are we spending so much money on
diesel?
[SPEAKER_01]: And exhaust shipping beets from Mexico or
even California to Texas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, California is a whole nother
podcast in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The damn place is a desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided to make California the capital
of Ag in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a freaking desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're paying the price because
there's no water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The aquifers are running dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quit raining.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lake Mead is at its lowest level in
history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get something like 80% of our
lettuce from California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all that to say Urban Ag checks the
boxes of so many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The customers are literally next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to get into details about
other things like grocery stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: dine for local produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't mean Kroger, Tom Thumb,
and Albertsons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those places are impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like organic food stores are starting
to pop up everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would love to have an Urban Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a great story.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love buying local.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we know our mechanic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know our doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know the guy at Foot Locker that sells
our shoes by name.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we don't know who grows the food that
we put in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of all, our kid's body.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just back ass words to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really just want people to understand
going forward, in the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Warren Buffett said this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, lawyers and doctors were the
people that made the money in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will continue to make the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But moving forward, farmers will be
included into that category in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Warren Buffett's not wrong about
too many things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you like the guy or not, he's not
wrong very often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've lived it for six years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the amount of money you can make is
ridiculous once you figure things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best thing about figuring it out
is there's YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a guy named Curtis Stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll make this real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a guy named Curtis Stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's known as the Urban Farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's the one that made this type of
farming popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: He farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Canada, in his town, it's an old
town.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have big yards, like third of an
acre yards, quarter acre yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he farmed nine people's backyard along
with his.
[SPEAKER_01]: The exact same way I'm doing mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he made $150,000 a year every year for
like 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he started vlogging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he vlogged every day for 365 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a little 20 minute, this is what I'm
doing today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And showed you how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I learned about salad mix
and grains and all that and the business
[SPEAKER_01]: side of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally, you have a free course to
learn how to learn, like learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: commercially on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you have Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will stay up 48 hours in a row
helping people get started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just send me a DM and say, how do I start?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will reply back questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I teach PE.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get bored.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's three balls, go play, and I'll DM
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live and breathe this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to help as many people get
started as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really kind for you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might regret your decision after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost like paying it forward because
I would not be where I am and have the
[SPEAKER_01]: happiness that I have if it would have
been for Curtis starting his YouTube
[SPEAKER_01]: videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's JM48.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look him up too if you're
interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just a ton of people out there
that's doing what I'm doing now on
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have the time or as you
figure it out, trying to set this up,
[SPEAKER_01]: the technology ability to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're doing is really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One last thing would be, is there any
other advice that you want to give folks
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to do the same thing as you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just start and don't worry about killing
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I killed so much stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look back and I'm like, God,
I was an idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, experience is the greatest
teacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, luckily for you, you don't have
to just learn from experience only.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can DM me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can watch YouTube videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do all these other things to
learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can learn how to start.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's so much money to be made.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're 50 right now and hate your job,
and you're going to retire in two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you need a little extra income,
this is the absolute perfect job for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got to love growing stuff and
getting your hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's nothing better than waking up
and going to your farm at seven o'clock in
[SPEAKER_01]: the morning and literally hearing the
birds chirp and watch the sun come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half my post on Instagram is the sun
coming up over the horizon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know why I keep posting it
because it's literally the same pictures,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just brings you back to the world that
we live in as opposed to cubicle and
[SPEAKER_01]: traffic and all that other crap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can the listeners find you and what do
you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Instagram is probably the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Dallas Half Acre Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easy way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shoot me a DM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comment, you know, hey, I DM'd you because
sometimes if we don't follow each other,
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes to a separate account in my inbox
and it's kind of a pain to find sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just let me know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can email me, mbell971 at Yahoo,
if you don't do Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd give you my phone number, but my wife
would get pretty pissed about that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after we email, I'll definitely give
you my phone number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so those are the three.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't do YouTube yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't have the capability
brain-wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too full of plant shit to add in
technology to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully one day I'll be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the three easiest ways to,
or two easy ways to contact me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And don't hesitate to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, you said do this, so I'm doing
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't ever get mad.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll definitely have a link to your
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're listening and on one of the
podcast platforms, just search for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed this episode, click that
thumbs up button.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend, I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode, and I'd love
[SPEAKER_00]: for you to tune into future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, once again, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a very inspiring story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some really good takeaways here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned how you do your process,
how you sell your produce and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: living from it really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've really set people up for
success in the future that they can take
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing and emulate it and
supply their local community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a strong message.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once again, thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, thanks for giving me the platform,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catch you next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace.
Peace.
