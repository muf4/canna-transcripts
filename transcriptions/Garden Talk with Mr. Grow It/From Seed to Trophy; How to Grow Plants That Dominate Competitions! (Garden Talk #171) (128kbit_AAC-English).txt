[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back, and I'm joined with
Myohide Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, how you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have actually entered in and won
grow competitions in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one thing I really want to dive
into today.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to learn how you go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not just talking about what
competitions are out there and how to
[SPEAKER_01]: enter them, but your specific strategies
that have helped you win.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to charge everybody a billion
dollars then if they wanted to exactly,
[SPEAKER_00]: because then I'm going to tell you the
winning formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before we get too deep into things,
can we do an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe tell us a little bit about yourself
and how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing on and off for 25 years,
I would say on professionally in the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: market for the last five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what made you get into entering
competitions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always had people tell me that I grew
really good flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to see if it was just people
blowing smoke or if I my flower was good
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt like that was the next logical
evolutionary step was to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if everybody's telling my flower
so good, my flower so good, let's see if
[SPEAKER_00]: it's good enough to beat other people who
hear the same thing as me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that was kind of just my
motivation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt like if and, you know,
I also thought, you know, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: just compete locally, because I think
that's what everybody does.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to go other everywhere I could
possibly do it and compete to really
[SPEAKER_00]: showcase that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what I have is special because I
felt like it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what competitions have you entered?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what awards have you won?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've won the Colorado connoisseur cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess that was the first competition
that I really entered seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as a solo grower and wanted to
test my skill and my selection process,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I wanted to prove that my
selection process was superior to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other guys in the competition
circuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Colorado connoisseur cup was an
eight month long blind judging competition
[SPEAKER_00]: here in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I entered that first with my Dante's
Inferno number six Fino that I hunted some
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was really special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, I believe the next competition
I won was the I want to say the Cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: Supply Showdown here in Colorado,
again, as well put on by Cultivate Supply
[SPEAKER_00]: Store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another blind judging competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to come out first place on
that one as well, which was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the very next competition I believe I
won was in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the Candy Connect Community Candy
Battle Royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I won that again, all of those
competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won with the same Fino Dante's Inferno
number six, except for the second win on
[SPEAKER_00]: the Colorado connoisseur cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won with one of my newest Finos,
the 5280, as well as my second window win
[SPEAKER_00]: on the Connect Battle Royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a the first round of the Connect
Battle Royale was a Candy Battle Royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second round was Candy and Gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So last year I won with Dante's Inferno
number six.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won best overall best candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year I won best gas with the 5280.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which is what I was going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, last year I won candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be cool to go in there and win gas
this year, which I was able to pull off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, that's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So million dollar question here is,
is Dante's Inferno number six available
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: C-form, clone, anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've I've released some I've made
some S1s and I also have the clone
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only thing with that cut is now
it's extremely volatile and it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: tendency to herm under like the slightest
stressors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really be in tune with the
plant and understand how to how to feed it
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it grows to really be successful
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if not, it can get wild on you and
it'll pollinate a whole room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're kind of like, you know,
you're not liking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something that I ever really
recommend for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had people buy it from me before
because they've been willing to take on
[SPEAKER_00]: the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have been successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have not.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear from other breeders from time to
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it's like we have this picture painted
in our head that any type of genetics that
[SPEAKER_01]: herm out is a sign of weakness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet you're over here winning competitions
with it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just proves that, you know,
that's my my thinking precisely is always
[SPEAKER_00]: outside the box just because something you
know, don't get me wrong if it herm to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point to where like it was detrimental
every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it was if it's manageable and the
flower is worth it, which it really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the level of uniqueness,
again, we'll go back to competitions after
[SPEAKER_00]: the Candy Battle Royale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won Spannabis in Spain with the same
Fino.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to go from local competitions to
statewide competitions to worldwide
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions with the same cut and win
over and over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: All blind competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Spain, I've never been to Spain
in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know anybody in Spain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to go there and win was just
like, wow, like I know what when I have
[SPEAKER_00]: something special and I knew this Fino was
exceptionally special in all my years of
[SPEAKER_00]: being a connoisseur going back to high
school, I've never seen anything like it
[SPEAKER_00]: smelled anything like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really the flavor profile that
gets you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's good looking good
looking flower everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the flavor profile is what really
stands out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's like a cherry rotten
fruit, cherry sugar, candy concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: times like a hundred it the smallest
amount in the room will permeate the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire, you know, space that it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have some at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about, you know, around three
thousand square feet at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can have like a fairly small amount
on my countertop and it'll literally fill
[SPEAKER_00]: fill from basement to the top floor all
with the scent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like it's almost like like like
some type of air fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing how it just spreads like I've
never had any Fino in my life that's done
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that's I think is one of the
reasons why it's won so many competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's not just, you know,
a lot of people ask me, how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's, you know, knowing how
to grow well is important, but really
[SPEAKER_00]: having that flavor palette to know when
something is different or to know when
[SPEAKER_00]: something is special, I think is what
really can make you stand out from the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about your growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you growing this plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you indoors, outdoors, soil,
cocoa, hydro, mainly indoor cocoa?
[SPEAKER_00]: I run the Athena Pro line.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, I've been running Athena
for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never been successful with any other
nutrient line in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not going to say that there isn't
something out there that's equivalent or
[SPEAKER_00]: better, but I just never ran into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I use what I know works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow in 100 percent cocoa, but I can
grow in any medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I prefer cocoa over rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just environmentally, you have much more
room for error with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a slight error with rockwool,
it can cost you an entire crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Error with cocoa, you have a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have some room to bounce back.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, like if you didn't,
let's say you miss in a watering event
[SPEAKER_00]: with cocoa, that can destroy your whole
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no bringing those plants back once
they reach a certain level of dry bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with cocoa, they can be wilty
and you can water and there'd be enough
[SPEAKER_00]: still in there to bring them back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that Athena lines, actually,
I just got my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't a chance to run it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've heard that sticking to the actual
feeding chart is what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to actually go outside of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going outside of that at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my own special feeding program for
Athena, a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to say that I go outside the
chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use any other additives,
but I have my own my own style,
[SPEAKER_00]: my own way that I like to do things.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for flour that you're growing for
competitions, are you doing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: differently on a feeding aspect?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same way I grow, you know,
the same way I've always grown my flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the same way I grow it for competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do anything different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just focus on I think one of the main
things with high quality flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion, is the drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people rush that or flub that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tends to once you lose turps,
there's no way to bring them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the name of the game is to
preserve the flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you even have one, but if you have
a solid flavor profile and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve that and it translates into,
you know, smokeable flour, then that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be something that's going to set
you apart from the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that's one of the biggest
mistakes that a lot of these growers and
[SPEAKER_00]: grows and facilities make is rushing the
drying process.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're drying your flour in a week,
you're doing it too fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to have a substandard
product in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of people, they just mess up
towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to the whole growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, they get into drying and
then they they mess things up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it blows my mind, because why would
you spend all this time, all this money,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growing, trying to grow the best
quality product ever to rush the last
[SPEAKER_00]: week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like 10 to 14 days is a proper amount of
time, even a little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would say, you know, 10 to 16 days
tops, depending on your environmentals in
[SPEAKER_00]: your dry space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you about the
environment conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you aiming for, for temperature
and humidity and drying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to run 65, 65 the whole way
through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that takes you to the 10 to 16 day
until it's dry and then you put into jars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow dry is what you want to really
preserve flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you rush it, you're going to ruin it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still might look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be, you know, it'll be smuggable and
people will like it, but it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be what it could have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll never go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So slow, slow and steady is the way to go,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you take it after drying and you
do a dry trim and then put into jars or do
[SPEAKER_01]: you use grove bags or what's your storage?
[SPEAKER_00]: After drying, I packaged ready for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally believe that flour is best
when it's freshest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe in any three month,
you know, crazy long month cures about two
[SPEAKER_00]: week dry, two week cure ready for market
is, is, is my, my honest opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when flour is at its best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, but I've also had flour that I've
entered into competitions that I've had in
[SPEAKER_00]: my freezer for six months and taken first
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think knowing how to preserve flour,
like knowing when that right time to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to fully package your flour and,
and have it like ready to go is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to back up and talk about traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you already talked about in the
competitions that really flavor was
[SPEAKER_01]: something that stuck out in yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that all that they're looking for when
it comes to picking a strain for
[SPEAKER_01]: competition or are people looking actually
plant structure potency effects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what, what's really prioritized?
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to traits, a lot of these
competitions, um, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: they look for all of the above,
um, you know, they look for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look for structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of the ones that I like to
enter, I like to enter competitions that
[SPEAKER_00]: look for flavor profile as one of the
judging metrics, because in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of the most important
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that we've kind of
lost in today's recreational world,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, they're so, so many of the same flavor
profiles, regardless of name out there
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's just, it's just, you know,
brought the industry in my point to a
[SPEAKER_00]: level where there's nothing unique left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything is the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything smells the same, tastes the
same, looks the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really trying to step away from
that and bring back things that I remember
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I remember as a connoisseur,
like as a teenager was always a unique
[SPEAKER_00]: flavor profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, there's flavor profiles
that I can remember right now at 47 years
[SPEAKER_00]: old that I ran into at 16 that I still
haven't seen again.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so those are the kinds of things
I'm looking for something unique that I've
[SPEAKER_00]: never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look for judging competitions that
have that as a metric, because I believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a, that's a strong way to win
because, you know, it's like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that, that excellent meal or that,
you know, that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Superb drink or whatever it might be that
you had that, you know, it's always flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: pallets that stick to your memory that
really like, you know, leave that lasting
[SPEAKER_00]: memory in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear the same thing from so many people
to where everything just tastes the same
[SPEAKER_01]: these days, you know, a lot of similar
effects as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very dull.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are saying that there's a
lot of dull flavor smell effects and that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really tough to find good stuff these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, and I think that's because a lot
of, you know, recreational, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have two types of growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a corporate model, which is a lot
of the industry right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, in corporate models,
they're not in it for the love of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in it to make money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of those models,
when they step into the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're thinking, what's the best genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need gelato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's buy as many gelato clones as we
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, and that's why there's so
much of that out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're not looking for
uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have guys like me that really
want to bring, you know, something cool to
[SPEAKER_00]: the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think guys like me are going to win out
in the long run because the corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: model is not a model that's sustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think ever since it's gone recreational,
a lot of these states, it's gotten worse
[SPEAKER_01]: and going down to be in the connoisseur
and really being craft, more craft style
[SPEAKER_01]: to where you're bringing that uniqueness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you mentioned, it's far and few
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The corporate model is not sustainable in
this industry at all, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's just not people want the,
the people who want quality are the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: who are going to last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole conversation on its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's let's get back to growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have a good question here for you
that I think a lot of people are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: want to know the answer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to growing these plants for
competitions, are you doing anything
[SPEAKER_01]: different as far as lighting a particular
strategy that you feel like gives you an
[SPEAKER_01]: edge in quality or trichome development?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't grow my flower any different
for competitions versus like if I was
[SPEAKER_00]: growing it at home for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the same standard throughout,
you know, but lighting is very important
[SPEAKER_00]: for trichome development.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run think grow LEDs, which in my opinion
are one of the more superior lights on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market today.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be something better.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be something equivalent,
but I don't know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't run into it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that being said, think grows are
my go-to lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like the most amazing spectrum
tuning a UV far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those things are important for,
and will increase trichome development as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as an early finish.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can finish a strain that
would normally take 58 days and 52 with
[SPEAKER_00]: the, with proper spectrum tuning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, which can, you know, significantly
increase profits and yields.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at it from, um,
you know, a business standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you adding in UV?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned UV.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you adding that in?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, what's your strategy for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use UV and far red.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, usually I alternate those spectrums
the last 15 minutes before the plants go
[SPEAKER_00]: to sleep in the first 15 minutes before
they wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll just get either straight far red
or straight UV.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just depending on where I'm at and,
um, what exactly I'm trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the end goal for all of that is
increased trichome development,
[SPEAKER_00]: increased flavor, early finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the UV and far red, is that only for
the flowering stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The entire flowering stage or late
flowering only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it through the entire flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, I alternate, um, when I'm
using it, depending on where I'm at and
[SPEAKER_00]: what results I'm trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you touch base.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already mentioned that you don't
really do anything differently for flower
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're entering into competitions
versus your own personal grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for your environment, what conditions
are you typically aiming for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in terms of temperature, humidity,
I mean, it really just depends on where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at, but I usually keep temperature
around, you know, between like 78 and 82
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees, just depending on where I'm at in
the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humidity can vary as well anywhere from 60
to 50% just depending on where I'm at in
[SPEAKER_00]: the flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make adjustments daily according to
environmental readings, according to
[SPEAKER_00]: runoff, like, you know, little things get
adjusted usually daily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not, I don't really have,
I can't say I have a set, a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent set SOP for how I grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things can be adjusted, you know,
according to how the environmentals are in
[SPEAKER_00]: play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daily.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really, it sounds like you're
really fine tuning things day by day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you supplementing that at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100% CO2 is a must in my opinion for,
especially if you're running a high PPFD,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, people need to remember the more you
turn your lights up, the more you should
[SPEAKER_00]: turn your CO2 up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things, those two CO2 and PPFD
should always correlate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what do you typically aim for,
for a PPM of CO2?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 1500.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, again, those adjustments are
usually made, like I'll make adjustments
[SPEAKER_00]: in CO2 levels throughout the weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the anywhere from 1100, you know,
1500 or more, just depending on what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard of, uh, studies around that
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like 1400 PPM was,
uh, like a 30% increase yield or something
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, supplementing CO2, you can
definitely get a increased amount in
[SPEAKER_01]: yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you just gotta make sure that
obviously your other conditions are fine
[SPEAKER_01]: tuned as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You increase the light levels and
environments dialed in nutrition and all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another important factor is, uh,
under canopy airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't, uh, you know,
take that into consideration, but the more
[SPEAKER_00]: airflow that you have in your room,
the better and healthier your plants will
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more that was respond positively
to the rest of your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely think that's one thing that a
lot of people sleep on is the under canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get airflow in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about precision stress
techniques?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing anything throughout the grow
that is, you know, I have before,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think precision stress techniques work
really well for a smaller grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, um, but I think when you start
getting into larger facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: it just becomes a tedious thing that
doesn't really produce that much more for
[SPEAKER_00]: the workload that you have to put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're a guy with an eight by
eight tent, yeah, pension stems and
[SPEAKER_00]: bending branches can really help you
increase what you can get out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're, you know, working with,
you know, a 500 light canopy, it's a waste
[SPEAKER_00]: of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about like drought stress and stuff
like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, dry back stress is, is definitely
something that, uh, um, increases,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, growth, uh, you know,
just, it just depends on like how fine
[SPEAKER_00]: tuned and precision you can get with that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally prefer hand watering,
but I'm, you know, I can run irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a, you know, I've, I've done it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I prefer hand watering cause I like to
be up and close and personal with my
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, but you know, at past a certain
size, again, it's just not practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have to turn to something like
irrigation strategies and they can work
[SPEAKER_00]: great too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think I've come up with some
really good formulas for irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies and I've seen them work well in
multiple large scale facilities that I
[SPEAKER_00]: currently consult for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give us an example at all,
or is it just kind of very by grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies by grow a hundred percent,
a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just varies by grow because you
have to tailor it to in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just be like, you know,
this is how you do it and think it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work like that anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's really not the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking from a small home grower
perspective, that's, that's me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like that's a majority of the
audience as well that are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: listening into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of things that people are using now
are the moisture meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: The AC infinity has one eco wit has one,
uh, but being able to see a percentage of
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in the medium has been helpful
for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know it's been helpful for a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So using that as a tool to kind of measure
dry backs is something I'm currently kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of playing with a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My way was always lifting pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lighter the pot, you know,
they were the closer we are to getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was, you know, always my go-to,
but I, yeah, moisture sensors,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you gave and get fancy,
you know, like they have grow link and
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff like that where it's all AI
controlled, there's a lot of, I think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're definitely heading into,
um, a future in the industry where a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of things are going to be like high,
uh, proficiency, you know, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: computer models that are just going to do
everything automatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, you know, so I'm, I'm hoping to
kind of beat all that out and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of get, you know, what I know how
to do out there before everything becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: too automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause I feel like it's going to be
pretty much like all other corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: models.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to produce, but it's not going
to produce good quality, but who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, AI is, is, is definitely being
integrated into everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll come up with an AI that
produces, you know, the highest quality
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll see.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be really interesting to see what
comes forth in the future here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think a lot of people are scared
to kind of see what comes of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can get some robot trimmers in the
house, let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finish the whole, finish the whole room in
24 hours, just work through the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that'd be fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the final weeks of the grow are
arguably the most important weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the common strategies that a lot of
people do is they'll, they'll lower the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature in the final weeks of
flowering in order to try to conserve
[SPEAKER_01]: those terpenes when you're growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know you said you mentioned your
personal grows are the same way you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: for competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do in those final weeks in
order to make sure you have the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: quality smell, flavor, and bag appeal?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, uh, a lot of those things,
you know, it's, it's, it's a combination
[SPEAKER_00]: of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just what you do in the grow,
but do you even have a good Fino that has
[SPEAKER_00]: those qualities in the beginning?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a good Fino that has those
qualities, okay, how can we preserve them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and yeah, uh, lower temperatures,
the final couple of weeks, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really much more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say even more important.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you do the final few weeks is after
you harvest, those last two weeks of
[SPEAKER_00]: drying is the most important to preserve
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, you know, try comes how you trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, are you, are you, you know,
fisting every, every Nugger you'd hold in
[SPEAKER_00]: stems while you trim all those things play
a part into quality at the end,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so you can have all the SOPs in
the world, but if you need to even have a
[SPEAKER_00]: good Fino, you're not going to,
you're never going to achieve that look,
[SPEAKER_00]: that taste, that quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always going to grow something
that's like a little bit less than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're wondering now, what do I need
to do different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe it's the genetic from the
beginning, you know, and maybe you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: great genetic and now your SOPs aren't
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, I would figure out which one it is
first before you say, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't working for me or I can't
achieve these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why can't you achieve those results?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it you, is it the plant or is it both?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you willing to accept that one at
one of the, I think one of the biggest,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, roadblocks for growers is ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nobody wants to admit that they
have an ugly baby, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's your, that's your kid that
came from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like, you don't want to,
you're not going to call your kid ugly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you, you're going to love that kid,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody wants to do that, but the
reality is not every kid's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can admit that to yourself,
you don't have to admit it to everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can admit that to yourself,
you can, you have the ability to grow as a
[SPEAKER_00]: grower and become something better than
what you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So me personally, I always try to leave
ego at the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always ready to learn something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you show me better than what I do,
I'm all ears.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you can show me equivalent to
what I do, you have all my respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're showing me less than what I
do, I don't really have time for that
[SPEAKER_00]: respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I've, if you're showing me less than
what I do, you can't teach me anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that I don't, I think I'm
better than you, but I'm here to learn,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my philosophy in, in the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to learn and I want to learn
from, you know, anybody that can teach me
[SPEAKER_00]: something I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's what seems like an endless
amount of things to learn in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, since science is continuing to
uncover new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me personally, that's what makes
this working.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the space so exciting, it says always
something to learn, always something
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just rinse and repeat every
single grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many different ways you can
grow this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I take a similar approach to you
on that way on that avenue where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: always learning as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's more than one avenue to
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got your organic guys,
you got your salt guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hating you at your sin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gannett guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not hating on anybody's methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I just know what works best for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to stick to that, but there's
more than one way to skin and cat and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's multiple ways to success with the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we talked about the final weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about flushing?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of salt growers, what they'll do is
they'll do a flush prior to harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, first of all, there are so many
definitions of flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your definition of flush and do
you flush before harvesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: My definition of flushing is bringing the
EC in the media under 0.5.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I do flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually like to flush like the last
three to four days with, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: straight pH RO water, no nutrients,
you know, and just rinse everything out,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring the, bring the EC all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But usually the last few weeks of flower,
I'm bringing the ECs down slowly anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the time I hit flush, I'm probably
at around two EC and I'll drag it all the
[SPEAKER_00]: way down to 0.5 over the last four or five
days, depending on the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in Rockwell, it comes down a
little quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in cocoa, usually about four or
five days, the last four or five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then, you know, you're seeing dark
purples and the color should just be
[SPEAKER_00]: busting everywhere in the garden.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then are you a firm believer that
flushing will lead to the color of the ash
[SPEAKER_01]: being white versus black or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's some studies out there
that kind of have disproved that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it kind of boils down to how much,
uh, you know, um, calcium and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: left in your, in your, in your media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but I don't, you know, the whole
flushing, like there's been a,
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a, I can't remember who did it,
but there was a study out where,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they didn't flush any flower and
they did a blind test with flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did flush and people pick the flower
that wasn't flushed a hundred percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that, that was done by Arc
screen technologies and they are a
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little more context there.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I just heard that and I thought,
huh, interesting, but yeah, that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that kind of makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, people who want to sell you
nutrients are going to tell you it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put as much in there all the way until the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I just wanted to ask you that,
get your take on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's very split, very,
um, still debated.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably flush because I've always done
it in the 25 years that I've been growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it's one of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be truthful that it,
that it works or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's kind of just ingrained in
my DNA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, if I, I don't like to do things
like what I'm, what I'm doing works,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't like to do things opposite of
what I've always do because if what I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing works, I don't, I don't need to
change anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's clearly not detrimental and
you're winning grow competitions doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're harvesting, are there any
specific techniques that you do to
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve terpenes and avoid damaging those
trichomes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I, when I, when I, I try not to touch
the flower, you know, when trimming,
[SPEAKER_00]: just try to hold stems while you're
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to hand trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't machine trim anything ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I believe in the time that it takes to
hand trim again, I, you know, I'll digress
[SPEAKER_00]: back to why are you going to spend all
this time and all this money growing the
[SPEAKER_00]: best possible product you can only to
throw it in a machine and have it chop it
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, I prefer a hand trim
absolutely every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that preserves quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I know it does
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I haven't used every single
machine trimmer out there, but they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do as good of a job generally as a hand
trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're taking that flower and
you're entering into a competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, you want that to look as pretty as
possible, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause a lot of these competitions are,
are going after bag appeal as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what about the testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there like, like how much does lab
testing matter in competitions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Most competitions that I entered don't
require it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but you know, I don't, I'm not a
believer in, I don't like to enter
[SPEAKER_00]: competitions that require, you know,
where a percentage is a metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I, that's not because some of
the best flower that I've had,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, had, you know, a percentage of
17, 18%, you know, versus some,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think a lot of labs flub these
numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of them inflate numbers,
you know, because if, if your business is
[SPEAKER_00]: to sell results, you know, you make the
results look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep coming back.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had so much flower where it was like
lower THC, like let's say lower,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like around 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you put it side by side with
something that was like 25% THC and you
[SPEAKER_01]: get pulled wrecked off of the 15% THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not all about THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many cannabinoids we
haven't studied yet as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest misconceptions out
there is that it's all about THC when
[SPEAKER_01]: really it's, there's a lot more to it than
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is one detail that most
growers overlook when preparing for a
[SPEAKER_01]: contest?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, uniqueness, you know, I, I,
it's hard for someone to know what's good
[SPEAKER_00]: when you've never seen anything better
than what you've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's an experience
that comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why, you know, I've been
able to win the things I've won is because
[SPEAKER_00]: I have 47 years under my belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of those 47 years, I probably spent at
least 30 plus, you know, as a connoisseur
[SPEAKER_00]: of the highest grade and always sought
that out no matter where I lived,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter where I was, I was growing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, and just, I guess my ability to,
to recall flavor pallets in my memory has,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, is one of the things I believe
that gives me an edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's one thing that if,
if growers can increase your mental
[SPEAKER_00]: library of flavors beyond what you're
normally used to can give you an edge in
[SPEAKER_00]: competition, because when you bring
something new, that's what wins something
[SPEAKER_00]: new, something special, something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what wins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I'm going to be going to the DGC
cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: I am not going this year, but,
um, you know, I've thought about entry and
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I might enter next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been around for several years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it's getting better and
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask your opinion on judging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if you have any feedback for me going
into this, basically they're going to give
[SPEAKER_01]: you, uh, they give everybody a little
chill them or whatever, and you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: around and sample everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you judge something like that with
when you have so many samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally I go for the sample that
stands out the most first.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those nose first, because after you,
you know, you sample, however many you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be like, it all tastes and smells
the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, if you have all the samples in
front of you at one time, I would smell
[SPEAKER_00]: everything first, then go from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that smell the best, put those to
the side, try those first.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that have no smell, they've
already lost in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if there's no flavor for a pie,
you already lost out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if there's like 10 jars and eight of
them smell the same, the eight out of
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go, I'm going to go with the two that
smell completely different and unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, pretty straightforward there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really good advice as smelling them
all first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to have to because you're,
you're, cause that, you know, your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your olfactory sense is you're going to
stay for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, you can definitely get the
different flavor profiles just through
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we taste with our smells,
so you're going to get the full flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: like that first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like the ones that stand out
there are the ones that I would like to
[SPEAKER_00]: try for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if that smell translates to smoke,
that's definitely along the lines of a
[SPEAKER_00]: winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring up, uh, something that reminds
me of, it was smelling a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: different flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too long ago, we were working with a
breeder on a collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one thing we did between smelling
was we smelled some coffee.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe some mock balls or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like that might work though,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm probably go to DGC with,
uh, with a little K cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: In between these samples, you smelling
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that could definitely work for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know there's a lot of people here
that are tuning in that they're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: during competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the biggest piece of advice you
have for someone who wants to enter in a
[SPEAKER_01]: competition?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, try to have something different than
the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, be confident in,
in the quality of your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have, be honest with yourself about
what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can't, you know, I see, I see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but like, again, I'll just go back to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to say they have an ugly
baby, you know, like nobody's going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if you, but if you can admit it to
yourself, you don't have to scream it out
[SPEAKER_00]: loud to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can admit to yourself that you
might need to work on your skill level to
[SPEAKER_00]: really compete, that's, that's probably
the best piece of advice that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: give.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest with yourself about what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never tell yourself you're the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let other people tell you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if a lot of other people tell you
you're the best, take it to competitions
[SPEAKER_00]: and see if you're really the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good way to go about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the ugly baby thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing that reminds me of are these
ugly plants I grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably gotten these ugly plants
before where there's like some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: weird mutation or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I swear these ugly plants, some of them
turn out to be fire, like really good
[SPEAKER_01]: nugs, dense, frosty flavor, smell
incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So well, what I mean by the ugly baby is
not necessarily appearance, but it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: of, this is something I created,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like, I'll give you another
analogy, like a chef, like no,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, you got certain chefs out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like no matter what they make,
they're going to tell you it's good,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it's not just because it's
something they created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times when people put time
and work and energy into something,
[SPEAKER_00]: they never want to admit to themselves
that it might be subpar to what everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else out there of people doing the same
thing as you, they want to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, mine's is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's is just as good as yours,
even if it's not, or mine's is better than
[SPEAKER_00]: yours when it's clearly not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, being honest with yourself is
the first step to success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm my own worst critic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of times where I'm like,
I know this ain't good enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many phenols I've
thrown in the trash, thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be honest with yourself about just because
you put time and energy and work into
[SPEAKER_00]: something, doesn't mean it's going to be
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean it's a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't mean it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it can be all those things to
you, but if it's not all those things to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else, you don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Respectfully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, this podcast episode has been very
insightful for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've definitely learned quite a bit of
things about you and how you grow your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and little things about
competitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even we got to the point of judging
some advice on judging competition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you coming onto the
podcast today and sharing your insights
[SPEAKER_01]: with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they could
find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you got going on that you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The easiest way to find me is on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: At my high day for 20 might be a little
shadow bands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to type in the whole thing,
but I'm fairly easy to find only one with
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue check mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say coming up are for me
competition wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely plan on doing the connect
community battle royale again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to get in some more licensed
competitions in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just had the THC classic not too long
ago, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm always going to be looking to
compete no matter where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to be spending a few months
out of the year down in Argentina,
[SPEAKER_00]: growing down there at a medical facility
and putting out the flavors to the people
[SPEAKER_00]: in South America.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really looking forward to that as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Jane in Germany in June, I'll be
there as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, I've been wanting to go to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to be able to make it this
year, but I know so many people go into
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should be a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm entering that this year and I'm
looking to take home the gold if I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have some really strong
contenders, so we'll see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, good luck, man.
