[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: With more experience you kind of see how
your plant tries to get away from the
[SPEAKER_01]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you can see the light stress with
proper experience is what I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go about 300 for seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between 300 and 600 in veg and between 600
and like 900 in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They saved my butt a couple times telling
me about a power outage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just at home where you'll get
notifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be absolutely anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainlining is one of my most favourite
ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just enjoy getting all that energy to
the top of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your tucking until the end of week one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that could change obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going with like a more sativa
strain I would probably tuck until like
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe the end of week two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have no one to impress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Either do you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no one to impress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just grow your herb and have fun doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody.

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Rose of Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to get into a whole
bunch of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, we're going to get into
environment and plant training,
[SPEAKER_00]: which a lot of people say that those three
things are some of the main keys to
[SPEAKER_00]: success in your garden, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of things to talk about there.
[SPEAKER_00]: First though, let's do an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm from a small town, Northern
Ontario, Canada, and I've been gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: since I was like five, six years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: My grandmother had a real huge area,
a real huge garden where she grew like
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers and plants and stuff, which she
would make like bouquets and stuff and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sell them to like people who were
having weddings and funerals and just
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much since I was just a little
one, I've been in the garden growing
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you've gotten up to the point
where you have a YouTube channel now and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sharing your garden with the world
on the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have almost 40,000 people
following you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000 subscribers on YouTube alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what your Instagram numbers
are or any of your other social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you've got quite a big following there
and looking through your videos,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have your channel open right
now on the side here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're showing your garden all the way
through all the different growth cycles
[SPEAKER_00]: from seedling, veg, flowering,
harvest right here, all that stuff you're
[SPEAKER_00]: covering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You even do like Q&A videos and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll definitely be sure to link that
down in the description section below for
[SPEAKER_00]: those of you tuning on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can visit his channel and see what
he's got and subscribe to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, if you are on one of the podcast
platforms, just search his name,
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosa Green.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: What grow lights are you currently using?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use the MERS Hydro FC 6500 is one of my
main lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I use a couple of the SP 3000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I just put in an FC 8000 into one of
my four by fours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I'll get a little pushback with
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: People think it's overkill for me to be
running a 8000 watt light in a four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four, but I just run it dimmed at like 50,
60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because I have that much power in the
tent, it doesn't mean that I'm using it
[SPEAKER_01]: all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's basically what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you say 8000 watts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sorry, 800 watt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an overkill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burning down the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough watts for multiple rooms in
your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm running the manufacturer facility
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: MERS Hydro, they have some good lights for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They definitely have some good lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've come a real long way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, a few years ago, I probably
wouldn't have touched them, but over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years, you can see they're really starting
to pick things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making good quality lighting and
fairly cheap for people getting into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I found their customer service
to get a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sponsored by them, so obviously I'm
going to get top of the line customer
[SPEAKER_01]: service.
[SPEAKER_01]: My subscribers, I noticed, are not
complaining to me about their customer
[SPEAKER_01]: service so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: They stepped their level up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before, I wouldn't be proud to say I was
working with MERS Hydro, and today I could
[SPEAKER_01]: actually say I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am proud to be working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember their blurples back in the day,
2014, 2015, and they were selling those
[SPEAKER_00]: lights all the way up until 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they still are, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they took them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given them that feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, why are you selling all day
lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, they sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that Viper Spectra company is
still selling those on Amazon,
[SPEAKER_01]: the blurple ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they really?
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually have a new light though,
which I'm actually getting my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're sending me over one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bar style light, and I was
impressed with the specs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think actually by the time this episode
is released, I don't think they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have the light released, so I'm not
going to talk too deep into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're another company that's come a
long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to the fixture, the
quality-wise build of the fixture,
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff these days for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always liked that company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have quality stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their quantum boards are all quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell that they take care of their
stuff, and that new light you're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about, yeah, people are going to be
impressed with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the download details on that thing a
couple months ago, and it does sound like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be a pretty good light.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have others coming on the way too.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I won't really speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three grow lights right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four by four tent where I'm
running two lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running the ES300V3 by the Green
Sunshine Company on one side, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: SF2000 LED grow light by Spider Farmer on
the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally grow all different cultivars
within the tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, I personally like to run two
lights in there so I can have different
[SPEAKER_00]: light distances as needed as some grow
taller than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm currently running.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have a two by four tent which has a
ES180V3 by the Green Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those lights I've really gotten some
good results off of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to run them dimmed, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: These grow lights these days, a lot of
them are more powerful than needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is there's a lot of new
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to run them at max.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think they're helping their plants
more when they're running them on full
[SPEAKER_00]: power.
[SPEAKER_00]: When in reality, a lot of these new lights
you can dim them down and you actually run
[SPEAKER_00]: them dimmed for the entire grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I tell people.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people question me on the show or on
my video, they say, what should I run my
[SPEAKER_01]: light at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will answer them.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I need to know what kind of light
you have because they're all so different
[SPEAKER_01]: nowadays from the quantum style to the bar
lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have to run a different wattage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only that, they're so efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nowadays, I don't even know how you would
go by gram per watt or anything anymore or
[SPEAKER_01]: go by per watt because they're just so
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either crank them up or you don't need
to crank them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people ask me how do I run my light,
it's like check the manufacturer what they
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend or do a quick Google search to
see if you can find your answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just watch your plants all
together like we used to do back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: day before power meters and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just watch your plant for your tips
turning down, the talkling, the light
[SPEAKER_01]: stress, how your plant is trying to
shrivel its way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just trying to get away from that
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it with a little bit of
education or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: The word that I'm trying to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, you just see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you grow, the more you'll see
signs of it trying to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely comes down to experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: With more experience, you see how your
plant tries to get away from the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see the light stress with proper
experience is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: The light energy coming down is photons.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people refer to it as balls of
energy coming down like rain onto your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You increase the amount of density,
increasing amount of rain or photons
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming down onto the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: People refer to that PAR,
photosynthetically active radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you aiming for a specific amount of
PAR or DLI?
[SPEAKER_01]: DLI, I typically try to run around 40 DLI
at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, when I'm trying to explain it to
new growers and stuff, I'll be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: more lenient with my words.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell them go about 300 for seedling,
between 300 and 600 in veg, and between
[SPEAKER_01]: 600 and 900 in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to stay away from telling them crank
it to 1250 in flour because I don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to see anybody burn their plants up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, if you're seeing deficiencies or
something like that, chances are it's too
[SPEAKER_01]: much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're giving them so much light that
they're trying to take up their nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to just be a little more lenient
with the PPFD levels that I tell people to
[SPEAKER_01]: use.
[SPEAKER_01]: For myself, I'm around a DLI of around 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I will push it depending on
strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ambient CO2 is usually around 400 or 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my house, it's usually around 750.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be able to play around with my PPFD a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I'll get it up to around 1200,
1250.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, I'm maxed out around
1050 in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are some good general ranges
that you mentioned before for beginners or
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who isn't quite aware of it
because that'll help you get safe ranges,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of folks are not going to have
the PAR meter in order to measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go and buy one of these PAR
meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apogee has one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a spot-on PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are several different measurement
tools now that you can use to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of PAR that your light puts out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can adjust your light distance
that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have one of those,
and you don't want to spend the money on
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those, what I usually tell folks is
check out the PAR chart that the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer puts on their grow light
listing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually, most companies, I think just
about every company now, is putting a PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: chart on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be basically an overview
snapshot of the different PAR numbers in
[SPEAKER_00]: PPFD that shows you at the different light
distances.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can refer to that chart and then
adjust your light distance that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's usually what I tell folks
that are beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those ranges you mentioned are
pretty spot-on, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have the Pulse Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually got four of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like them quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be a little honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did start off using them for VPD,
but without having a sealed room,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so difficult to keep that VPD day in,
day out, hitting the nail on the head type
[SPEAKER_01]: deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to do without a sealed room,
so I just keep it as close as I can to the
[SPEAKER_01]: VPD, and I go from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a real cool unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can actually get a somewhat basic
PPFD reading with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see your spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most LEDs are going full spectrum
nowadays, anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They save my butt a couple times telling
me about a power outage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just at home where you'll get
notifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could be absolutely anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be across the country or in a
different country and still be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: that reading.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not to totally try to advertise for
them, but they are a real awesome unit,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find, anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was curious about the Pulse Pro in
particular because it does have CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: readings and also has the PAR meter on it
built in, so you can check what the PAR is
[SPEAKER_00]: and adjust your light distance according
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people might get sticker shock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they see that the price is $500,
and I had sticker shock at first,
[SPEAKER_00]: but somebody commented on one of my
videos, and they're like, think about it
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a PAR meter within it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That alone, the Apple G sells for $525
alone, so you're getting a PAR meter,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting the CO2 measurements,
obviously the temperature and humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're getting the ability to have it
sent to your smartphone if something's out
[SPEAKER_00]: of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting those notifications when
needed if things are out of range.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Pulse One, need to get the
Pulse Pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one of my next purchases
for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You touch on the price of a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's the same thing for a CO2
meter, a good CO2 meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not finding under $100 for a good
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the price isn't bad if you
actually think about everything that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to see them cheaper,
but it is what it is, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what temperature do you typically aim
for?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in veg, I'll usually be around 28
degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's like 82, 83, maybe
Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: In veg, I'm usually around there,
and then as I get into flour, I like to
[SPEAKER_01]: cool things down a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll usually run around 25 degrees during
the day, maybe 22 degrees at night.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the same thing for veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: At night, I go down to about 24 degrees
Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I talk, I'm talking at Celsius.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, anyway, I find in flour,
it's better off to go by how true nature
[SPEAKER_01]: goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It usually cools down in the fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not only that, I find it tightens up
your buds and stuff if you run it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: cooler in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you noticed that,
but it's just something that I picked up
[SPEAKER_01]: on over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, so I always try to run a little
cooler in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And warmer in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring up a really, really good point
as far as the increased temperatures in
[SPEAKER_00]: veg, and then reducing it in flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, I need to learn Celsius,
because I'm stuck in the freedom units,
[SPEAKER_00]: as pigeons often calls it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if I have a key right here,
I can see, OK, if he's talking this,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can quickly refer to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually aim for around 80, 82 degrees
Fahrenheit in vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes I'm running that throughout
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm currently in school.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know that I'm in school
for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the studies that was brought to
my attention through this school is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they studied the optimal temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the optimal temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're doing pretty much what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're seeing that high increased
photosynthesis with the higher temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, assuming that the VPD is dialed
in, CO2 is dialed in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going after the high
photosynthesis during veg, a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: into flour as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, towards the end of the flour,
they're finding a, if you stay at that
[SPEAKER_00]: high temps, they're seeing that more area
or bud structure, foxtailing can
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially occur, and also a loss of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're evaporating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So their recommendation, what they found
in the study is that if you're lowering in
[SPEAKER_00]: those temps a little bit towards the end
of flowering, maybe weeks five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six and beyond, I'm just gradually
lowering them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could conserve some of those terpenes
and it should result in more tighter bud
[SPEAKER_00]: sites, like you had mentioned that you
often see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, of course, that's going to depend on
genetics and stuff like that, but I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was worthy mentioning here
because something I learned recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how about relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically aim for there?
[SPEAKER_01]: In veg, I try to shoot for 65,
but it's hard to get that here in the
[SPEAKER_01]: winter, even using like a humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always try to keep it around at least
50 to 65 in veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes I can't always get there and
it's somewhere around 45 and I just got
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidifiers pumped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, if it is around 55,
I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in flour, I shoot for around 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 50% of flour, it just seems to,
it's always worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it like that for a few years now
and it's what I prefer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some general ranges that
folks stick by, you know, there's a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of, you know, if you're a bare bones
beginner, just starting out and you just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to get through your grow,
40 to 60% is kind of the general range
[SPEAKER_00]: that the plant is going to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get a yield out of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But dialing things in, which is kind of
what we're talking about here,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, VPD, you know, we talked about
that a little while ago, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So when your temperature changes,
according to VPD, your humidity should
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of change as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It should kind of change with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really comes down to the stomata
opening and being able to intake that CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: at a specific rate, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally do aim for VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that I can actually naturally fall
within that range just by the way my room
[SPEAKER_00]: is set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So oftentimes when I'm running that 80,
82 degrees, I think VPD calls for,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to remember off the top of my
head, like 55 to 60 something,
[SPEAKER_00]: 62% or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, see the confusing thing is
there's so many different VPD charts
[SPEAKER_00]: online.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were to search VPD chart,
you would get so many different results.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people go after Pulse,
their reference guides, but then there's
[SPEAKER_00]: different guides according to the
difference in leaf surface temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes things even more confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So generally speaking, usually it's like
minus one degree on the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what your canopy temperature is,
for example, your leaf surface temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: is usually, you know, one degree less.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now lighting is going to turn in,
is going to be an impact of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're HID lighting, you're going to
have the eye IR come down and heat those
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves a little bit more than LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is just so many variables when it
comes to humidity in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, general ranges, there's
certainly general ranges that folks can go
[SPEAKER_00]: by just to get to the grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you supplement CO2 at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I used to do like the own,
I would make my own like milk jugs full of
[SPEAKER_01]: the sugar and yeast and try and do CO2
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, that would work if I didn't
use an exhaust fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was able to keep it cool enough
inside a tent with an air conditioner and
[SPEAKER_01]: not exhausted out, it would work.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're running any sort of exhaust
fan, even just into a lung room,
[SPEAKER_01]: it really doesn't help all that much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to get that bottle hooked
up if you want to take the advantage of
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2, I find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with, I don't want to throw them
under the bus or anything, but like the
[SPEAKER_01]: TNB Naturals, I really don't find that
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically the same thing that I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing any exhausting at all,
you're not going to get any benefits from
[SPEAKER_01]: that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had a bunch of CO2 meters that I
purchased to try it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I made more videos on it,
to tell you the truth, just so some people
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't wasting the money on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as soon as that fan comes on,
you're pretty much, you lose that CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're exhausting 24-7,
some people have their inline fans on the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use the TNB Naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have the canister for TNB Naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a CO2 monitor as well, which I've
taken measurements on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's built up past 1,000 at some point,
so you know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wasn't exhausting 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing intermittent exhausting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the EEC Infinity inline fan,
which is hooked up to controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have set points, so if it goes over a
certain temperature, it'll kick on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove that hot air, and then it will turn
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: If humidity rises too high, reaches that
set point, it'll turn on, exhaust,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then turn off when it's below that set
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like in that case, you can
definitely get away with the CO2 canisters
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also have the Exhale 365 bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just started using that last month,
and things are working out pretty good so
[SPEAKER_00]: far with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing got inoculated within a
couple of weeks, so I was a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first time using it, but I haven't
done the CO2 measurements on that just
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, but I do know a lot of people that
are running those with success,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they mention that they're increasing
their CO2 levels quite a bit with the
[SPEAKER_00]: bags, and also with the canisters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're exhausting 24-7, you probably
don't want to spend the money on CO2,
[SPEAKER_00]: since that's probably just being sucked
out to the grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got your fan off, why not,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't even tried out those mushroom
bags yet, so that might be something I try
[SPEAKER_01]: next, just to give it a shot, see how it
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what are you doing for air
circulation and air exchange?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hooked on AC Infinity, everything,
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I got their new fans early.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think the other ones come out
until April or March or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have fans on their website now,
but that is just for the non-oscillating
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I do mostly is I run the AC
Infinity fans or any other six-inch fan I
[SPEAKER_01]: used to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll typically have three in each
four-by-four tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have one on the floor, and then I'll
have one on a close pole to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then one on a far pole.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always like to tell people that airflow
is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot praise that enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want good airflow, you want air
blowing around, and then I use,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, the six-inch exhaust fan that I
always change my air in my tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's on the off setting, it's really
at about the number two setting,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's always a bit of airflow,
and it's usually up around eight percent,
[SPEAKER_01]: or setting number eight, exhausting during
the day in order to keep that temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: down and flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the most part, I use AC Infinity
everything for my indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't even say they've really come a
long way because they've always been
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much top-notch, like their fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like everything that they put out
is just, they're hitting the nail on the
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've definitely changed the game quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to their fans, that was a
major game changer with it hooked up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the controller that you have set points
for temperature and humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they've got that oscillating fan that
you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told them, because I work with them too,
I said, send me over four of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got four of them now, and I've been
using those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to put at least two per grow tent
in case one were to die out, because I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had that happen before where I had one of
my inline fans die, and I only had one in
[SPEAKER_00]: the tent at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was all that stagnant air,
and it led to bud rot, and I had to throw
[SPEAKER_00]: away some colas that encountered bud rot,
which was a freaking disaster.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's on my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can watch that and laugh at me
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, AC Infinity, I do the same thing
with trying to get airflow below the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, and also try to get airflow above
the plants as well, through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it'll work its way down below
the plants, up through the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then of course, if your inline fan ducting
is connected to the top part, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that exhaust there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, having the rectangle intake
vents open, like if you're using a grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent, for example, is certainly key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into plant training next.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you typically do for plant
training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any topping, LST, super-copping,
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do a lot of mainlining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, I do a lot of topping,
and bending, and low-stress training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainlining is one of my most favorite
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just enjoy getting all that energy to
the top of the plants, and just dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with big buds and colas, instead of little
popcorn buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much any video you see of mine,
I will have a mainline plant, either here
[SPEAKER_01]: or there, in one of my tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, I do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some super-cropping I will do,
depending on if I get a branch maybe too
[SPEAKER_01]: long, that I want to flatten out the
canopy or something, I might super-crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or on my outdoor, I will do some
super-cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually super-crop a couple of them
real hard last spring, just to make all
[SPEAKER_01]: the other tops come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I basically do it all when it comes to
training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain the mainlining process in
more detail for those that don't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: From my understanding, you're letting it
grow to a certain node, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: topping, then you're letting those ones
grow to a certain node, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: topping again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain in detail how you go about
doing the mainlining process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's what you just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: You let it grow up to maybe the fourth
node.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want your plant to be eight inches
tall, then you take off four inches right
[SPEAKER_01]: away or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take it down to the fourth node.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do lose a bit of edge time that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really prefer to do that so that you get
stronger branching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you top it the first time,
you top it, you spread those branches
[SPEAKER_01]: apart a little bit, and then you remove
all the other bottom branches.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got your two mains coming out
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then your next time, you top these two
mains.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do two toppings.
[SPEAKER_01]: You top one on your right, one on your
left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you've got your four tops and four
mains coming off that, with everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you would top your third time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you get eight tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time you top, you're pretty much
doubling your tops, the amount of tops you
[SPEAKER_01]: have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically stop around eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am going to be doing one on this next
series.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to be doing one plant to 16
tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would go two tops, four tops,
eight tops, 16, 32, 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one person who commented,
on my channel, saying that they did 128
[SPEAKER_01]: tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted him to send me pictures,
but he didn't reply back to me after I
[SPEAKER_01]: replied to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was interested in seeing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been quite wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: Picking that up, I might actually do that
this spring on an outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might do one with a ridiculous amount of
tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for the short version of how you
main line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You continue to top until you get as many
tops as you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you main line, like I said before,
all of your bud focuses to the top and to
[SPEAKER_01]: colas instead of a bunch of branches
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're still doing that lollipop technique
where you're taking off the lower third or
[SPEAKER_00]: lower fourth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That helps focus it on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mainlining the theory behind it is
that, and I don't think anybody can prove
[SPEAKER_00]: this, is that if you have equal distance
from the stalk to the colas, then it's
[SPEAKER_00]: evenly transporting nutrients up to the
branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the mainline, how it's
actually done, all the branches are even.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the same exact distance to where
your colas start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a little bit of a variation of
mainlining.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what I did was I let it grow to
the fifth node, top down to the third
[SPEAKER_00]: node, left the second node, branching,
and removed, I think I removed the first
[SPEAKER_00]: node, branching.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, right off the bat, I was able
to have four branches right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not evenly branched.
[SPEAKER_00]: The branches aren't evenly distributed or
whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found it was a little bit of a shortcut
to the mainlining process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I did do a top, so it's eight tops,
eight main colas, 16 main colas,
[SPEAKER_00]: topped again, 32 main colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: 32 was the most I ever done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally felt like it was a little bit
of overkill for my situation because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to keep the plant at two foot by
two foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having 32 tops on a plant, I think I was
in a three gallon container too,
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I didn't get much of a stretch
once flipping over the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant was small because when you top
and you have all these different branches,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do that flip to flower and it
starts that stretching period,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you don't just have a few branches
stretch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have more branches stretching,
so you're not really going to get as much
[SPEAKER_00]: of a stretch most of the time,
generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, eight main tops is typically
what I go for, sometimes 16 main tops for
[SPEAKER_00]: me growing each plant at two foot by two
foot space.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I found works well for me,
but I feel like there are so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always tell people to experiment,
try things out, see what you can do,
[SPEAKER_00]: have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's the thing with it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like mainlining, it puts you, you're so
much hands on and I really like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really enjoy training plants and growing
the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just all about yield or how fast
I could turn over a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I enjoy the training and doing
what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I don't want to rush it and get
it all knocked out in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will get a lot of people will comment to
be like, oh, that takes way too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, in all reality, mainlining only
adds a week on to what I regular veg
[SPEAKER_01]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I regularly veg about five weeks,
I'll go six weeks with the main line,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it doesn't add all that much more
time, but it's what I enjoy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted to just knock them out of the
park, I would just fill the tent with six
[SPEAKER_01]: plants every time I grew and do no
training and just grow them fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, being hands on with your plants
is one of the most fun ways to do it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I find.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I'll continue to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen you had some amazing success
with the Scrog technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain your process there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've done a couple of Scrogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this is one of the first ones I've
ever actually done on my channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, I would have
enjoyed to start off with like two plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't know until later on that I
was going to be doing a Scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did it with four plants, kind of
happy I did that anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause it filled the canopy a little bit
more, but I went from seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was up in the air of like,
what kind of phenols I was going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little worried about that,
but I ended up making it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'll do is for hybrid strains,
I will just keep tucking my branches
[SPEAKER_01]: under.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't usually weave my branches through
because it's a bitch to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, what my language are, but that's
all good to harvest that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'll do is I'll just tuck all the
branches right underneath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all pushing up on the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then they gain their support that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you just end up with a bunch of
tops and you'll be good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in week five now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's anyone interested in seeing
how a good Scrog goes, feel free to go
[SPEAKER_01]: check out my channel because I'm just in
week five now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still have a few weeks of that left to
go.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most viewers, it's the most exciting
part because we're starting to put on all
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's Bitties by Soulfire Gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real nice strain with a real potent
smell to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a follow up question I have for you is
like, some people swear that you should do
[SPEAKER_00]: one top first and then it allows the lower
branches to come out and then spread into
[SPEAKER_00]: that Scrog net a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also some people swear by a
certain height from the grow pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the net should be a certain height above
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do a topping and then what is your
distance from grow pot to net?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to leave a distance about a foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll get my plants to grow about a foot
and then I'll toss them underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: Scrog or I'll put the Scrog down and then
I'll start the train from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't look like you're getting
much out of it the first couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just looks like a plant bent over,
but it seems to be a better way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just trying to remember the second
part to your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no, I don't top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, I didn't top this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, next time maybe I will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I switched it up here and there,
but for the most part, no, I just bent it
[SPEAKER_01]: over and let all those branches come up
and then continue to bend them over and
[SPEAKER_01]: underneath the Scrog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when actually went to your,
I saw this on your Instagram is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using not your traditional Scrog
net.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like it's like a clear plastic
and they're not actually squares.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about what you're using
there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I found that online.
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually when I use like Scrog,
Scrog netting, I can't even say usually
[SPEAKER_01]: because I don't do it all that often
really to tell you the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done it a few times now, but usually
I want like smaller squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it's easier to train with like
smaller squares, like three inch squares.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I was doing is I was looking for
something that I could hook up to my
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Grow Tent, the high CFM kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know those bars that
go across in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps for the suction of the sides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I was looking for a Scrog to
attach to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came across that other Scrog online.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the P Scrog.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot the name of the website,
but that's what I'm using there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the plastic one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm real happy with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came with like the poles and it was
easy to put together, reusable,
[SPEAKER_01]: washable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have to worry about trying to
untangle a messy net.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then are you just doing one net or
some people do like two layers,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people do three layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that's what I do, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just do the one layer because what
I'll do is I'll tuck until up to the first
[SPEAKER_01]: week of flowers over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's enough stability when all those
tops come up and put your buds there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to get nice sized colas.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to end up far away from your
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just find it ends up perfect if you do
your tucking until the end of week one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that could change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, if you're going with like a
more sativa strain, I would probably tuck
[SPEAKER_01]: until like maybe the end of week two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I would just watch that plant and
see how it starts out stretching since I
[SPEAKER_01]: flip it from 12-12.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would just judge it from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, for like your
indicas and your hybrids, I suggest
[SPEAKER_01]: training them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep tucking them until your first week of
flowers over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you won't need that second screen
to support your buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of people group this in to
plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people call it pruning method,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any sort of defoliation?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what's your process for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, if I'm just growing my plants
normally, say give them one topping or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever, I will do a good default maybe
around a week or four and a half,
[SPEAKER_01]: five of veg just to keep all the airflow
going, make sure that all the bud sites
[SPEAKER_01]: and branches are going to get light to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly for airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all about the airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then yeah, so later on in flower,
about week three, I will do another heavy
[SPEAKER_01]: default depending on how I grew them.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the main lines, you don't really need
to default that much because you're
[SPEAKER_01]: defoling as you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, when I do a default,
I sometimes I'll strip them right down
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on like the cultivar,
or I'll be a little more easier on it and
[SPEAKER_01]: just select which ones I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: With autos, I will tuck most of the time
and just do selective defoliation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to go real crazy with autos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned my lesson with them a couple of
times from going too hard on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for the most part, I'll just tuck and
remove the ones that absolutely need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: moved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then sorry, for then for in flower on
photo periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I'll do a strip in like week
three, but continuing out in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I'll do then is I'll just,
again, I'll select certain leaves that are
[SPEAKER_01]: blocking bud sites that I'll remove the
rest of the way through flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you mentioned super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do that sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you say that you typically do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't do it all that often,
but I will do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I get a branch getting out of
hand, getting taller than the other ones,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I'll super crop it just to bring it
down and have it with flatten out the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy or on my outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm starting out outdoors,
sometimes I'll just give it a hardcore
[SPEAKER_01]: super crop, break that thing right in
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll bend it right in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that all the other bottom branches come
up to start filling, start filling like
[SPEAKER_01]: the fencing that I put around my plants
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes I do it, sometimes I won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it just depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only time I really do super
cropping is when, you know, I've flipped
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants to flowering and I'm having
trouble controlling the stretch,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause some of these phenos, they're just
going to stretch way beyond your
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a phenol frozen fuel by Squirrel and
Genetics, shout out THC Titan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stretched three times the amount it was
in vegetation stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost ran out of height.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that in particular, if I was
running out of height or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I'm doing the scrub technique or
whatever, and some branches are higher
[SPEAKER_00]: than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'll do the super cropping
technique for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Pigeons, he does super cropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: He swears by this every single one of his
branches and when they're small and he
[SPEAKER_00]: swears by it and he has a lot of success
doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something I haven't tried yet,
but I've been wanting to try.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think maybe this round, next time
around, I'm going to have to try to super
[SPEAKER_00]: crop every branch and see if it can build
up some strain, see if it actually does
[SPEAKER_00]: work or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I find with your branches,
if you like mess around with them,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make them feel like they're out in nature,
bend them around and stuff, just to
[SPEAKER_01]: strengthen them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that beefs them up a bit,
that and some good silica, but I've never
[SPEAKER_01]: super cropped every single branch,
no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's definitely a unique technique,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he's always had a pretty unique way
of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like his training has always been pretty
heavy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since like I started watching him,
maybe like four years ago, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: he always did some real heavy training.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that a lot of those videos were
lost, I think, when he lost his channel,
[SPEAKER_01]: but yeah, he used to have a real lot of
good training episodes on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we covered a lot in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went over lighting, went over
environment, we went over plant training.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for new growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we went over so much information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some folks that are brand new
that are just starting that might consider
[SPEAKER_00]: this overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: To hear this type of information.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people just want to keep it
simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for people who are
just starting out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let it stress you out at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're planning on starting like a
YouTube channel, don't stress about that
[SPEAKER_01]: either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your subscribers will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, do not stress about
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all going to come with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch a lot of videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to only like do one thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't try to show a master garden or have
a master garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to like grow that one plant first.
[SPEAKER_01]: See how you can do with that and then
upscale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I say start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get a good light is always key,
of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you could need some fans and stuff,
but just start with the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start with like a basic nutrient line as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just take it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get mad at yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not growing to impress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another thing I try to tell people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I have no one to impress either to
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have no one to impress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just grow your herb and have fun doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can listeners
find you and what do you have upcoming in
[SPEAKER_00]: the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have my YouTube channel,
Rose of Green.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my main one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I have a backup channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more or less of a it's called Rog
Grow Tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where I show off like lights and
fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just do reviews of products on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, I have my Instagram,
Rose of Green 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: And something new that I'm doing is I've
been dabbling in the breeding for the last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of years and I'm going to be
releasing a strain here shortly in the
[SPEAKER_01]: next month or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Rewind.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cross of Grandaddy Purple and Oji
Kushbreath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can check that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just follow my channel along and I'll show
you where you can find them because I
[SPEAKER_01]: can't really spit it out on here without
YouTube getting angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That cultivar you mentioned, is it an F1,
F2, F3?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I bred it to an F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found a really nice Grandaddy Purple a
couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd use that in a couple of good
crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I found a real nice Oji
Kushbreath.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I made the cross there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, I found a couple nice
sister and brothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I turned it into an F2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just made the feminized version
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made some S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to be releasing the regular
seeds and the feminized seeds together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will definitely have a link to
Rose of Green channel down in the
