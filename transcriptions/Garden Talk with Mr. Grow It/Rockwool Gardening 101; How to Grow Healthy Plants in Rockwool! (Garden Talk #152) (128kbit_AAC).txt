[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
Podcast, this episode number 152.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Chris Swank.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for 11 years and
grows plants exclusively in rock wall,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what we get into in today's
episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks all about how he grows his plants
in rock wall, everything from preparing
[SPEAKER_01]: for planting, nutrition, pH, irrigation
strategy, environment controls,
[SPEAKER_01]: and more.

[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing good, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been on the From the Stash podcast
a couple different times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, great conversations in those
episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Real fun conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are friends IRL in real life.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you live locally here and I've been to
your grow before and one thing I noticed
[SPEAKER_01]: is that you grow on rockwool entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are overdue for an episode of
Growing in Rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had anybody on this podcast
growing in rockwool yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had some people that started out in
rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did seedlings in there and then they
transferred over to either a bank of soil
[SPEAKER_01]: or cocoa or hydroponic system,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But growing in rockwool throughout the
entire growth cycle, that's a way you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do it successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm excited to have you on here
today and talk all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you having me on,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an honor, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Linking with you and the boys has been
just so organic how this all happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only way I can put it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we get into rockwool deeply,
can you give us an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the owner, founder of Swain Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're essentially a genetics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We focus primarily on breeding genetics
and eventually as soon as we get to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain point, we'll be offering those
genetics in various forms, seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, primarily a genetics company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I fell into it by just loving the plant
from a very, very young age.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into it around 2001 and I didn't see
my first living plant till around 2013.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that was the change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the plants for the first time
growing in full flower and it just changed
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to learn, I had to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to become a part of it and a buddy
of mine who showed me that garden was
[SPEAKER_00]: willing to take me under his wing and
teach me how to grow and did that for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we came back, left California,
which is where his garden was and came
[SPEAKER_00]: back to Vegas and started my own thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before we started recording, you mentioned
you were doing it for about 11 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been in rockwool the entire time
or have you tried other grow methods?
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially when I learned they weren't
in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the garden, I was learning that in
North Cal, they had an outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was all soil, and then they had an
indoor, which was all cocoa under high
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So initially I learned cocoa, high
pressure sodium is indoor and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: straight soil with amendments outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then honestly, in doing that,
I mean, I know there may be people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to like me saying this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, I could not wait to never touch
soil again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it's backbreaking, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you're at scale and you're
really doing it for real on a farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no joke and hats off to every
gardener that does it because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are the real workforce for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, me being the type of person I
am initially was like, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, how can I create more efficiencies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just naturally in my life, I'm all about
finding efficiencies and soil just was not
[SPEAKER_00]: it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And neither was cocoa, neither was most of
the alternatives until I stumbled onto
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned being at scale and I think
that's one good thing to clarify is you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not just a small home grower with a couple
of tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are growing at scale and yeah,
that makes a big difference going from
[SPEAKER_01]: just growing a handful of plants,
six or 12 plants up to growing,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, what are you growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: 50, a hundred plants plus plants at a time
or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we were on the farm,
it was, it was a, I mean, we had,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is back in like the Prop 215
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had, you know, 99 outdoor and then
he had, I don't even know, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 150 lights indoor, you know, so yeah,
thousands at that point, but it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: broke down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's that the person that taught me
how to grow is kind of where I got the
[SPEAKER_00]: ideology of you can have a hundred lights
or 200 lights and still be small batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's very counterintuitive to what
people think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, no, it's just because
you don't have to build a 60 light room or
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred light room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have a hundred lights and have 10,
10 light rooms that are all staggered out
[SPEAKER_00]: in various points of growth, you know,
to, and you can, that'll allow you to
[SPEAKER_00]: have, you know, variety and multiple
harvests of different genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not just sitting there doing the
same thing over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, like he's the one that kind
of put me into that ideology where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, Deb, you've got a lot of lights,
but really you don't cause it's all an
[SPEAKER_00]: eight and 10 light rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why Rockwool?
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, what is Rockwool?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of folks that are beginners.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might not even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you explain what is Rockwool and why
growing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the benefits to grow plants in
Rockwool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically, it's spun rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they heat rock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that this is necessarily
the greatest analogy for it, but think of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a cotton candy machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they, they basically get the
rock from my understanding to like almost
[SPEAKER_00]: a molten state and they spin it and it
becomes this very fibrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a fibrous, almost, almost kind
of like fiberglass insulation for your
[SPEAKER_00]: house would be like the way I could
compare, like the feel to it, if that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes any sense, but a little denser than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and yeah, it's just, it's,
it's, it's, it's a natural thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't think it's natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the process of doing it isn't,
but it is essentially just rock melted
[SPEAKER_00]: down and then spun into this very fibrous
soft material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's something that I found
when I got into it initially, like yes,
[SPEAKER_00]: why the why was again, trying to figure
out how I could get away from soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I tried Poco and it's like,
all right, well, this is basically just a
[SPEAKER_00]: not soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's still heavy and it's still,
it's still messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a process that I just don't
want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: How could I get clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to me, that's the whole point of,
if you're going to go through the hurdle
[SPEAKER_00]: of setting up an indoor grow, then you,
and it's all about cleanliness indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, indoor, you have to extra be
careful with what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, how can I avoid having soil like
doing dry backs with soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have dry dust, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, dirt that's going to
naturally get into the HVAC and get into
[SPEAKER_00]: the dehu system and get into your fans and
your filters, because it's just dry dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what's going to happen,
you know, and Coco similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like pellets and other things you
can do, but, you know, I think when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to that point, it's just preference,
but with pellets, I find that when I tried
[SPEAKER_00]: that, it didn't make sense for the root
mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the fact that the roots will
actually penetrate through the grow down,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the rock wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, that's kind of how I got to
it was, you know, you, you can pot an
[SPEAKER_00]: entire room.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also pot, which is something that I
don't feel is necessarily common practice
[SPEAKER_00]: with people that grow in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we pot, you know, you can run
through an entire room of pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: several hundred very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's not a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not hurting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the whole crew isn't like
dreading the day of transplant like you do
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do soil or Coco, you know,
it's, it's a very, very easy, friendly
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to utilize in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a handful of benefits
there on the flip side.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say some of the downsides
of using Rockwell is?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be on top of your watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If at any point you, you lack on your
watering, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is really no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also in regards to buffer from a
nutrient standpoint, there's no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the benefit of soil,
especially when you're a beginning grower
[SPEAKER_00]: is that the plant, the soil has,
you know, like the way I like to tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people that grow in soil, which I'm not a
soil king by any means, I know probably
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 1% about soil, but the little
bit I do know is that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially you're never feeding the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're really feeding the soil and the
soil is feeding the plant, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that, the soil has its own
ecosystem and its own pH and its own EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it will act as a buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, the beginner grower mess something
up, you know, you don't have that buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: at all zero when it comes to hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do one wrong feed and it's wrong
enough, your plants are dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you could maybe attempt to bring
them back, but if you do something bad
[SPEAKER_00]: enough, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the same could be said for
soil, but that bad enough would have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: much worse than it would be, you know,
if it was hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so yeah, I think, I think the
downsides are that there's no buffer there
[SPEAKER_00]: for watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no buffer there for nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to really be spot on on what you
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how does growing in rockwell
compared to other methods of growing such
[SPEAKER_01]: as soil, hydroponic systems, cocoa in
terms of yield and quality?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so the quality thing is I'm a firm
believer that you're a good grower if you
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow good in any medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it doesn't mean anything
other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's no need to go deep into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we talk yields, when we talk,
you know, the end result, a lot of that's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's all, it's all subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all objective.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, there's so many variables to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, to me, if you can just show me a
finished product that doesn't hurt my
[SPEAKER_00]: throat, that has a great nose to it,
that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enjoyable all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't really care too much
about the bag appeal, but bonus if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: there, you know, it's, it's like,
that's what I, I care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, we can talk about how
you grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause that's to me, a secondary,
you know, people get so wrapped up in how
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, just smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's good and you enjoy it,
then it's good and you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like don't let the fact that they grew in
organic or organic or in salts or in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't, don't, don't let that play into
what you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just try the end result first and then
work backwards from that and figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people assume I grow soil or
organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, or living soil or no till or all
these famous catchy phrases that are
[SPEAKER_00]: popping up in the last five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, when I tell people,
Nope, none of that, you know, I'm proud to
[SPEAKER_00]: say that I grow in salts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm proud to say that I grow
hydroponically and I'm proud to say that I
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out a way to grow quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower without all the backbreaking work
of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep going back to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a lazy dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know quite a few people who say
that the yield is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to get a higher
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of got more control over the,
the nutrients pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to kind of be spot on,
but you can achieve a higher yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as quality, you talked about flavor
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a comparing stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a lot of your stuff right here
and you were nice enough to gift it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every single one of these is very
flavorful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the papaya syrup is just,
it's my favorite.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big debate upon growing
organically versus growing with synthetic
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients and the flavor profiles and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now it's really just debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can definitely still get flavor and
I've got proof right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still get flavor from growing a synthetic
nutrients, particularly your style with
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I figured I'd mention that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, I've done labs and,
and 100% labs show that in my experience,
[SPEAKER_00]: a and being between like say a 600 watt,
the Vita high pressure sodium verse the
[SPEAKER_00]: fluence LEDs that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a 630 watt fluence versus a 600 watt
HBS way back seven, eight years ago when I
[SPEAKER_00]: really started trying to compare an A and
B and figure out if LEDs were better,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at that time they were better,
you know, because the labs would show
[SPEAKER_00]: that, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This genetic on branded, there's other
environmental factors that play into this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but assuming you can get your environments
roughly close each time, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then your lab shouldn't skew too much,
but there'll be differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it goes from say, you know,
1.7% terpene profile on a dry tiered plant
[SPEAKER_00]: when I grow it in a Vita and then I grow
that same plants under a fluence and all
[SPEAKER_00]: of a sudden I have 2.4, 2.6, 2.8% terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a little difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a 60, 70, 80% difference in
terpene content.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, that's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you do that for so many labs and
so many plants, and you do run that
[SPEAKER_00]: through several different genetics and you
A and B it against the high pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: sodium versus the fluence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, no, I mean, historically
speaking in my experience with the labs
[SPEAKER_00]: I've paid to get done independently,
yes, there are higher terpene profiles in
[SPEAKER_00]: LEDs, at least our LEDs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also not a person that's going to
sit here like most people do and be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: well that, you know, LEDs suck or HPSs
suck or no, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's again, it's preference just because
you get a lower terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: If when I smell the plant, I like it,
you did great, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people get so wrapped up in the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's cool when you're trying to
develop your way of your processes,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not cool to wrap up the end
consumer and all that data because then
[SPEAKER_00]: they're driven by something that they
don't fully understand, as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_00]: being driven by their senses, which is the
best thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smell, taste, touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We eat food with our eyes before we ever
taste it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: If something comes to you and it looks
disgusting like sewage because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: spinach based, you may be the greatest
dish on earth, but it looks like sewage
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're probably not going to want to
eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're going to have a negative
connotation to it right from the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no difference to me with plants
and people understanding or wanting to get
[SPEAKER_00]: fed the science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets in the way of your base instinct,
which is just, how does it smell?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like, let's just go back to
that, you know, and let the growers worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about all this nonsense that we're trying
to have a conversation about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you what you mean when it comes
down to preference, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different strokes for different folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to jump backwards to get into
the initial planting in Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you properly prepare and
condition Rockwell before planting seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: or clumps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rockwell has a natural higher pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe it sits somewhere around like
seven, five, seven, seven, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least the, the grow down, which is the
company that who's Rockwell I utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's somewhere in the mid to
high sevens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually will essentially just get
a big, you know, like a hundred gallons of
[SPEAKER_00]: water, pH is water down to 5.5 and then
we'll drop all of the blocks that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using into that water to soak for like a
half hour to an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially what that does is it
brings that pH level down to more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: neutral pH of around six, two to six,
five, somewhere in that range,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is safer for younger plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you essentially just have to,
excuse me, you just just have to condition
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant or condition the medium to
receive a plant, but that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cool thing with that is you
don't have to saturate afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with soil, a lot of times you'll have
to, you know, you'll, you'll kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: dampen the soil and you'll plant your seed
and you'll cover it or you'll plant your
[SPEAKER_00]: clone or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll go back and rewater the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't even have to do that because you
just did that soaking process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it kind of also removes a step just,
just in an act of having to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, pull it out, put it in a tray if
it's a clone or put it into a block.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a, if it's a clone going into a
block or whatever stage of life is that
[SPEAKER_00]: with all of the Rockwell, you have to,
you have to condition it, if you will,
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the pH correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there you just put whatever
you're going to put it into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as that is a seedling or a clone
that's rooting, what techniques do you use
[SPEAKER_01]: to encourage strong root growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And Rockwell, I mean, for one,
I definitely use Clon-X.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a person that says you have to,
there's been plenty of times where I've
[SPEAKER_00]: gone and need to take cuts and didn't
realize I was out or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take the cuts anyways, cause the cuts
got to be taken, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but ideally I use Clon-X if I can,
because it just, it has a rooting hormone
[SPEAKER_00]: and it also kind of just helps when you
make a cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're talking in cuts, not seeds,
it helps when you make that incision and
[SPEAKER_00]: that cut line to just sterilize and make
sure there's no infection that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also give it some hormones and
something to kick start that rooting
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of that, nothing, you know,
it's just, you know, I go into the 1.5
[SPEAKER_00]: inch Aokis, which are the clone cubes that
we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, the conditioning of it
is really that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as seeds go, I'll usually put,
I do the cup tech where I'll just pH some
[SPEAKER_00]: water to like six five, some RO to six
five, and I'll just drop the seeds into a
[SPEAKER_00]: solo cup, let them sit for usually just
one day and they'll crack sometimes two
[SPEAKER_00]: days, but never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than two days, you know, and then as
soon as they split and I see the little
[SPEAKER_00]: tap root, I'll just take them,
place them out, tap root down and pop them
[SPEAKER_00]: in one by one individually into the same
1.5 inch Aokis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So rather than doing clones or seeds,
it's always the 1.5 inch Aokis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Clon-X that you use, are you just
dipping the cutting into that or are you
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a stoke of the rock wall with the
Clon-X solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's some people that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I just do strictly water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I just have a little,
shot glass and I'll pour some Clon-X gel
[SPEAKER_00]: into and just dip each clone in and yeah,
super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are you using for a nutrient
lineup and how do you go about feedings
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the growth cycle?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the company we use is Current
Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another little thing that's
slightly different about us is that most
[SPEAKER_00]: people have never heard of our nutrient
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because it's made by a company
called Current Culture and Current Culture
[SPEAKER_00]: specializes in DWC, which is deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deep water culture, without going into
that, too much, it's a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology of growing where your plants
are essentially constantly suspended in
[SPEAKER_00]: water, similar to aeroponics, but
aeroponics utilizes misting at certain
[SPEAKER_00]: intervals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with DWC, the roots are literally
suspended in water 24-7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that they don't root rot is
through a process called hyperoxygenation,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they have oxygen pumps that are
essentially pumping air into the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much so that the plants don't,
the roots don't realize that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: suspended in water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't get that root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get what would usually happen to
anything if it's sat in water for days,
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks, months.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I utilize their nutrient line in
hydro, which can be done, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely not the lines designed for per
se.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more designed for the DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's called Current Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a two part.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an A and a B for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an A and a B for bloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have boosters if you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on what we do, I do or don't use
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're growing for flower, I'll utilize
the boosters to get some more density.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're growing for rosin, I do not
utilize the boosters, and that's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: other conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have it another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so yeah, just a simple two part,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as regiments, start out
very, very light.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a third part to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Current Solutions' version of
essentially a cow mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Coco Cow, but it's basically
just a cow mag, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it'll be a cow mag and then the A
and the B.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're in clones, when I first take
cuts, it'll be very mild.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be usually one mil per gallon on the
cow mag and one mil per gallon on the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: A and B until I see roots form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that point, I'll up the cow mag to
two mils and I'll keep the veg at one
[SPEAKER_00]: until I'm ready to essentially start
acclimating them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I acclimate them, then I'll start
slowly each week working up the feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our feeds change weekly from the day
we take the clone until the day we harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't ever have the same feed for two
weeks in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you measuring the EC or have a TDS
tester to measure a PPM and are you going
[SPEAKER_01]: off of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or are you just looking at the feeding
chart and using that and not touching the
[SPEAKER_01]: EC or PPM?
[SPEAKER_00]: Neither.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking at the PPM, I'm not
looking at the EC and I'm also not going
[SPEAKER_00]: off of anything data related.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent of how I feed is
strictly based on how the plant responds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to demystify, whenever I talk to
people, man, I really do try to demystify
[SPEAKER_00]: the growing for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that everybody should grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, why would you say
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my business, the more people that
grow, the better it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to sell tissue cultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to show people that growing for
yourself is good because once you smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: your own thing, you'll never want to smoke
anybody else's again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you may have had better stuff,
but there's something rewarding about
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it yourself that is unexplainable
unless you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I encourage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think that's probably a little
shock factor for some people seeing that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a little bit hands-off when it
comes to EC, PPM and following the feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: chart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I imagine to begin, you probably had some
struggles, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you kind of figured it out over
time, repetitive and getting the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you grow healthy plants every time,
I assume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I went to your grow space,
man, everything was healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't a deficiency anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess it's because I try,
like I was saying, I demystify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I utilize a lot of principles that
nature would utilize, even though I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor and even though I'm using salts,
as people like to say, I really hate that
[SPEAKER_00]: term.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can dig into that later, but I'm not a
fan of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan of people miseducating
people and trying to say that salts are
[SPEAKER_00]: bad or somehow unhealthy for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely crazy talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I think that taking approaches to
growing that mimic nature as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible will always result in a better
end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just, yes, in the beginning,
I screwed up some plants because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand exactly what they wanted in
relation to specifically the nutrient line
[SPEAKER_00]: I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you find a range over time and
you go, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of anything I grow is going to
probably be fine within this range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, cool, we'll have the
outliers and they'll show signs.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get burning, all right, we got to
back it off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we get yellowing, we got to increase it
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm broadly speaking, but it really is
kind of that simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, I don't focus on EC or PPM
because it's, again, I'm not a fan of
[SPEAKER_00]: putting that much science to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll put that much science to getting my
environment correct and getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity dialed to where I can have it
within a one or 2% of exactly where I want
[SPEAKER_00]: it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But outside of that, no, when it comes to
the feed, in my opinion, the more within a
[SPEAKER_00]: range, the more inconsistent you are with
your feeds, the better the plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: respond to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And overall, the more trichome production
you will develop and overall the higher
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and flavonoids and cannabinoids
you'll get from doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason being is that because in
nature, the plants produce trichomes when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stressed for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many reasons the plants stress
in nature to create trichome production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all that to be said, the thing that we
enjoy about the plant is the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oils that are in those trichome heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those trichome heads are formed
through various stresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can induce certain stresses by
not letting the plant get comfortable and
[SPEAKER_00]: complacent, by having the same exact feed
every single day and it knowing that at 10
[SPEAKER_00]: a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: when your lights come on, they're getting
water, you know, maybe instead,
[SPEAKER_00]: four days a week, you water exactly when
you want to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then those other three days,
maybe one day you water an hour and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the other day you water three hours
late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the other day you don't water until
you see the plants just starting to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: full dry back and want to droop on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the week,
you go back to water in the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and when you do things like that
and when you don't worry about your PPMs
[SPEAKER_00]: being the same and you don't worry about
your ECB, being the same and you're okay
[SPEAKER_00]: with your pH fluctuating maybe 0.2 or 0.3,
which a lot of people think that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is more in hydro than it is soil,
but it's still not a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially if you only pick one or two
days a week to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like those little things are what create a
better product overall because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the plant to have the same types
of natural stresses it would have in
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you about pH next.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you already mentioned 5.5 pH for 30 to
60 minutes soaked to begin and then that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to end up around 6.2 to 6.5 pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how about the remaining parts of the
grow like the veg, flour?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you aiming for a specific pH of the
nutrient solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're in clones, I aim for between
6.2 and 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get into vegging, meaning clones
are acclimated and we're transplanting
[SPEAKER_00]: them and we do three transplants
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go clone into the first transplant,
which is an Aoki cube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we go those 1.5 inch Aoki's into
four inch, I forgot what they call them,
[SPEAKER_00]: the six inches of the Hugo's.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what the name is for the four
inches, but we go into a four by four by
[SPEAKER_00]: four block, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there we go into a three
gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a mom, five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's something that's going into
production is a three gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at each stage of that, we change
the pH range until we get into flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we maintain a consistent pH range
for majority of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start out from 6.2 to 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when we get into the four inch
cubes, we go from 6 to 6.2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we essentially are ready to
transplant into pots, we'll keep it at
[SPEAKER_00]: around that six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over the course of three or four
weeks in veg, once we transplant into
[SPEAKER_00]: pots, we'll usually continue to veg for
another three to four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over that three or four weeks,
we'll mean it off from 6.1, 6.0 to roughly
[SPEAKER_00]: 5.8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we hit 5.8, we'll flip to flour
and then we'll start our flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll usually maintain 5.8 until
the very end of flowering and we'll kick
[SPEAKER_00]: it down to 5.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that little tenth is, you'll get a
little bit more, again, in our system,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to everything, but in our
system, we'll get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome production because then you're
getting pretty low in the pH, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: fine in hydro, but you are getting down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll start seeing that adds a little
bit of stress to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get that little extra trichome
production right at the end to just get
[SPEAKER_00]: that a little bit of frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say from, broadly speaking,
6.4 to 5.7 will be our range over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of, you know, roughly the 14 to 16
weeks that that plant will be alive from
[SPEAKER_00]: clone to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, have you ever encountered pH
fluctuations that has caused problems with
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant's growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you go crazy, yeah,
of course, but everything's within range.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that if you keep, when we're
talking pH, if you can keep it within 0.3,
[SPEAKER_00]: 0.4, you're not going to hurt the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a big swing, but it's not going to
hurt the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if something happens where maybe you
didn't calibrate your pH meter or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that, and then you are an
extra 10th or two tenths off in one
[SPEAKER_00]: direction or the other, no, you're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to do, you'd have to skew it
pretty bad.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into water and irrigation
strategy next.
[SPEAKER_01]: You kind of touched upon it a little bit,
but I like to get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already mentioned using RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I live in the same area that you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water out the tap is 485 PPM,
almost unsafe to drink according to EPA
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything over 500 PPM is unsafe,
just below that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very high in sodium,
bicarbonates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my experience trying to use that
water, that tap water, it's just,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been unsuccessful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get lockouts that happen and really
raggedy plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I use reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you use reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do for an irrigation strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, so we just have a, essentially,
it's really just a three stage,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's technically a two stage,
but we have a pre-filter system because of
[SPEAKER_00]: how bad the water is here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go into a pre-filter two stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a sediment and a carbon filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those two kind of strip it down pretty
good so that my main RO doesn't,
[SPEAKER_00]: the membrane and whatnot doesn't have to
get replaced as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm replacing the pre-filter every three
months and that's allowing me to not have
[SPEAKER_00]: to replace the main filter usually for
about a year, somewhere between nine to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: months.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll get out of having to replace the main
filters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside of that, I mean, yeah,
once we go into the, once it comes out the
[SPEAKER_00]: RO, we store, I usually have to try to
store three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've found that if we can have three days
of backup, usually within three days we
[SPEAKER_00]: can fix any issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's enough time where if a problem
falls on a weekend or something like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can't get somebody out for a
Monday or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I store three days, but, and as far as
irrigation, we don't utilize irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hand water everything, which that's
another thing that a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of shocked about is that we'll have a
hundred plus lights going and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: hand water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are like, oh, it's inefficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this, it's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be better utilizing your time to
work on other aspects of the garden to
[SPEAKER_00]: make the plants out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear all the arguments and a lot of
that's, I mean, quite frankly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll keep the swearing to a minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be the only one I say it's
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run through a hundred lighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have one employee run through
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: If their sole job every day was just water
plants, one employee in a six hour shift
[SPEAKER_00]: could run through a hundred plus lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe in doing that because it
allows you to put your eyes on every
[SPEAKER_00]: single plant every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing that will get missed.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing that will be overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing that you won't see
happening on one random plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it allows not all plants feed the
same, even if it's the same genetic,
[SPEAKER_00]: not all plants feed the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have a hundred of a hundred clones of
a given mom in a room, I'm not all 100 of
[SPEAKER_00]: those phones are going to feed the exact
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all going to uptake slightly
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allows you to see like, Oh,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I can skip this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant's not drinking like the other
90 of its cousins.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, it's just, it doesn't want
water today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's the only thing is it
allows you to kind of feel things out,
[SPEAKER_00]: look at the plants, assess and determine
if you really even need to water that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in hydro, I think that's better
because Nats are a big thing in hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: Nats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nats, I would say more in hydro than
anything I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very prominent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because generally speaking,
people that grow in hydro do utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation of some kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that irrigation keeps a constant
moisture on the block or the rock wall,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allows perfect environment for Nats.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so I don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also hand water because it allows us to
do dry backs, which is something that
[SPEAKER_00]: people think is an absolute sin when you
grow in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you could totally do a dry back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all about just watching and just
tending to the plants and understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do promote dry backs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We tell people, yes, you can dry back in
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you should drive back in hydro.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're set up, utilize all these
different trays and it would be perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: for a flood drain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume that that was the case,
but then I'm now, I remember that she said
[SPEAKER_01]: you hand water everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do you determine when to water
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, a lot of it just has to do
with the plant's uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't stick to like a
regiment, if that makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially not when we're in veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we're in flower, the way that we
propagate the rooms, we know when to flip
[SPEAKER_00]: to flower from a size standpoint of the
plant, where once we're in flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant will drink every day,
where if we didn't water it the following
[SPEAKER_00]: day, it would die.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we try to not get to that point until
we're in flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leading up to that, like when we first
transplant into the four inch cubes,
[SPEAKER_00]: that initial transplant day, we won't
water those plants again.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clone into cube or the clone into four
inch block, that block being soaked
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no roots in it yet,
because we just put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes four or five days for those roots
to spread out into that block a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we won't water those phones for four to
five days until those blocks fully dry
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and then when we do water,
it'll be a light watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to sit there and re saturate
those blocks all the way fully because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's still not a massive group mass in
there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even when we do go back and water,
it'll be a light water to make it so that
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to water them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we can get the dry bags always
about the dry bags because in hydro Nats
[SPEAKER_00]: are your worst enemy and they are coming
all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, unless you want to utilize
crazy shit, which I do, I don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, you dry backs, dry backs are the
best way to try to fight those,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely helps with reducing the pests
because if you, on the flip side,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you keep the moisture content too high,
you could have issues such as like over
[SPEAKER_01]: watering symptoms and root rot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever come across those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, because we do it how we do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, uh, you know, and I don't mean
that at all in a cocky way whatsoever,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just because we don't have irrigation
and again, not to say people that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: with irrigation are going to screw
themselves and it's a no, no win scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people running millions of
lights across this country right now doing
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation drip systems that are
completely fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that being said, like, yeah,
I just, um, no, I've never ran into root
[SPEAKER_00]: rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no, there's no ability for it to
happen, you know, in the way we do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that can show up on the Rockwell
cubes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually had a conversation last time I
was over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the algae that's on there
and, uh, I think there's misconception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to us all about algae being on
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it harmful or harmless?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your experience with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, completely harmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it just doesn't look good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people want to see the Rockwell
and it's pristine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of people will get the plastic
inserts that go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the sun can't hit it,
but algae, when we're talking specific
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, algae is completely harmless.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it does nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does act annoying because it creates
like a little barrier on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or like, you'll have to water like an
extra couple of seconds to penetrate
[SPEAKER_00]: through the algae outside of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It absolutely does nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's very, it's common
anywhere that you have water and like
[SPEAKER_00]: constant water and lights, algae will
form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do it in a fish tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do it in a pool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll do it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use chlorine and pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we use, you know, cleaners and
scrubbers and fish tanks and other fish to
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically eat algae and nature,
nature figures out its own way to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, this week, we could do it,
but now we're adding different things that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't need to be mixed into the plants
just for the sake of taking out something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's already harmless for the plant
anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's just a lot of people look at
it and they're like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that mulch?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope, it's just algae.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Calm down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no big deal at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only time it would be
potentially a problem is if you see it on
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and your plant is struggling,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you could potentially have an
overwatering symptom that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happened to me before where it's
like seeing that little bit of algae
[SPEAKER_01]: growth on there, look up at the plant and
be like, uh-oh, looks like it's a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit overwatered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that might be an indication if you're
in soil to kind of back off on things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is something that is in Jeff
Lowenfeld's book.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if he read teaming with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not because I know you're not a
soil guy, but he's very in-depth about
[SPEAKER_01]: utilizing microbes and growing plants and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has a whole chapter, a section on
algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it talks about how really it breaks
down to like silica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a non-essential element for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually can be beneficial so
yeah, I figure I'd bring up algae because
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's a common misconception when it
comes to growing in rockwool.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in everybody's, I mean,
I've never seen a garden in rockwool that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have it unless they're using those
little plastic inserts that go over the
[SPEAKER_00]: blocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it in my humidifier before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, like you mentioned that the
sunlight does it on the water and it
[SPEAKER_01]: could, algae could form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, obviously I have to go in
there and clean it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a pool and I had to manage my pool
and you had an algae bloom set come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there are products that you can buy
to get rid of algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really what feeds the algae is phosphorus
in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like talking about me, just think about me
managing my swimming pool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a product called phosphory,
which you put in once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, obviously you remove
the plant material that's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fallen debris that comes in the pool,
remove all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause that's just feeding the algae.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyways, yeah, it's funny how this all
relates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's correlations everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing is again,
going back to wanting to demystify it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the correlations between humans and plants
are insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: The correlations between how humans
reproduce and plants are insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, it's endless.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it really is an ecosystem that isn't
different than ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually fits into ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next, let's get into environment
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically aim for,
for temperature, relative humidity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you supplement CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, what do you aim for there?
[SPEAKER_00]: It all changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on in life, like when we're
talking clones before they're acclimated,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're obviously throwing them into trays
with domes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally keeping them around 84,
85, 86 degrees with hopefully as close to
[SPEAKER_00]: a hundred percent humidity as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they're acclimated,
ideally I want my nursery to be somewhere
[SPEAKER_00]: between, you know, 82 to again,
84, 85 degrees with roughly 70% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we get into blocks and we
start transitioning to closer to them
[SPEAKER_00]: being in pots, you know, mid sixties to
the seventies and, you know, low seventies
[SPEAKER_00]: in, in humidity and, you know,
maybe creeping down into the high
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies at night, but still maintaining
around 80 to 82 in temperatures when the
[SPEAKER_00]: lights are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we get into pots over the
course of vegging, I'll get the room
[SPEAKER_00]: basically down to roughly 78, 79 degrees
and around the mid to low sixties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once we start flowering for the
first three to four weeks of flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll maintain in the low sixties and
humidity and I'll maintain the high
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as flowering progresses,
once sites actually form, that's when I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: start weaning everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the exception to that is if I'm
growing for rosin, when I'm growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin, I do not lean off humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another conversation, but to stick
to flower, I will wean off humidity and
[SPEAKER_00]: temps throughout the course of the rest of
the flowering time of that plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by the end, when I'm, you know,
in flush per se, I'll probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in the range when the lights are
on of around 68, 67, 69, somewhere in that
[SPEAKER_00]: range temperature wise, and roughly about
50% humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, for flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, yeah, when the lights are off,
that'll get down to probably 58,
[SPEAKER_00]: 59 in temperature and humidity same
roughly around 50%, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when it's for rosin, we'll dip
the temps, but not as crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go down to maybe like 72,
73 when the lights are on and maybe 66,
[SPEAKER_00]: 67 when the lights are off, but I will
maintain the humidity in the mid to high
[SPEAKER_00]: sixties because you end up with a more
resonance plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you can maintain above 50%,
even if you go 51%, if you can just
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain above 50% humidity, relative
humidity, then naturally you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have less off gassing of terpenes and
things on the plant and essential oils
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of doing their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, temps, yes, drop because it
slows off gassing, but humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it higher, you know, when we're
talking for resin production or rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how about CO2 you're
supplementing there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you measuring the PPM, that's in the
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, that's something we will use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a time where I will use PPM for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you mean for, for different
PPMs throughout the different stages of
[SPEAKER_01]: growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So early on, just natural atmosphere is
usually enough to take care of the clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, most atmospheres around
where we're at is somewhere in a range of
[SPEAKER_00]: 400 to, you know, between 350 and say 500
is what the natural atmosphere is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's plenty fine for clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we get into blocks, and they're not
in domes anymore, I'll start introducing
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 at roughly around 550 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not much higher than natural
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll stay there until we go into
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we go into pots, I'll kick it up
about 650.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then every week that I'm in veg in
pots, which is usually four, four weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: for most strains, I'll kick it up a
hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So week one of veg, I'll be at say 650,
750, 850, 950, like usually at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: that week, or sometimes at the start of
that week, depending on the size of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when I'll flip to flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from flower, I found like we've
pushed it as high as, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,900, 2,000 at certain points of us just
trying to see what would stress the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you ride, I've found that you really
have to kick it pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you need to get really high and
almost where it's, it's, it's dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: for humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you need to get around like four
or 5,000 PPM to really hurt the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I mean, it'll, you can maybe
affect it less than that, but there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see a benefit in yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see a benefit in higher terpenes
or flavonoids or cannabinoid production
[SPEAKER_00]: when we would get it tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So honestly, when we're in flower now,
I keep it around 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't up it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't down it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I'm in flush, I'll usually cut off
the CO2 entirely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which again, that's just an added stress
to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's little things like that where
that last week of flush is just,
[SPEAKER_00]: no CO2 whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: That room's going to deplete everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I walk in the parts per million,
it'll be around 80 or a hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is basically suffocating the plant
at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's intentional, you know,
because again, it's an added stress right
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very end of life, you know,
just a, it's no different than people
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that whole three days of dark thing,
which I'm, I don't necessarily agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: just because it's not really whatever it's
neither here nor there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just creating stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just same, same concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just do it through kind of suffocating
them a little bit, you know, as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: just free picking them out for three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, I just kind of naturally
let them deplete any CO2 around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably a spark some people's
interest when we talk about flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do flush at the end of the growth
cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, what is your definition of
flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there are a couple of different
definitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people think that flushing is running
a large amount of water through the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other people consider flushing,
just stopping nutrients at a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your definition of flushing and how
do you go about flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: So my definition of flushing is depleting
the plants of any and all nutrients to the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where all that's left that it's
uptaking is water essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the plant being depleted of,
of any and everything, because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: can deplete it like that, that's going to
make a much smoother smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make a much better cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to just make a much better end
result of a plant, you know, like that
[SPEAKER_00]: quote unquote white ash that everybody,
you know, chases, which honestly is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhat a myth that, you know,
I don't really care to debunk,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the white ash thing is kind of
bulls**t too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, for the people that want to
chase that cool, just flush your plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot and you'll get a white ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's, it's, it's not guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also got to not be an idiot and grow
and care about your plants throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you cared about everything up to
that point, and then you flush on top of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to truly deplete the plant of any of
its nutrients that it's going to have in
[SPEAKER_00]: the water leaves and the sugar leaves in
the stock in the medium to where it's
[SPEAKER_00]: literally just water in the inside of that
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get in the, I mean,
it's just common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you had dirty water and you ran it
through a charcoal filter, and now all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden you have crystal clear clean
water, which one would you prefer to
[SPEAKER_00]: drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so for that same logic,
which one would you prefer to smoke?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's why I've all,
you know, to be honest with you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always had a beef with people that
don't flush like a lot of soil growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially like the no till people in the
living soil people, they have this
[SPEAKER_00]: ideology is you don't have to flush like
nature doesn't flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, no guys, nature tills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nature flushes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature does flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what a monsoon season is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nature does till.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what animals are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what storms are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what wind is like, you know,
that's what, that's what a lot of things
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a hundred percent soil gets tilled in
nature, you know, and a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: there's insects, there's worms,
there's things that are in the soil that
[SPEAKER_00]: are moving it around and tilling it,
you know, and that's underneath on the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface, a hundred percent surface layers
of soil are getting removed every year
[SPEAKER_00]: through monsoon seasons and through just
natural, you know, storms, nature,
[SPEAKER_00]: mother nature doing what mother nature
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm a firm believer that there's
no scenario whatsoever where you should
[SPEAKER_00]: not flush your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care what you grow in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to get to your goal of completely
depleting the nutrition, are you running a
[SPEAKER_01]: large amount of water through it or are
you just cutting off nutrients and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: water only?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water only, I'm cutting off nutrients,
doing water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: Initially, like for the first couple of
days of flush, I will like say for
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation sake, I water one gallon per
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll water three or four or five gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just sit there and soak the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: To try to just flush the medium itself out
because it's a little more difficult with
[SPEAKER_00]: soil because soil wants to retain,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But with hydro, it doesn't want to retain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you just literally run water through
the medium long enough, you will rinse out
[SPEAKER_00]: all of what's whatever little deposits are
still left in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first couple of days, maybe a few
days, I will just fully just oversaturate
[SPEAKER_00]: with water, but still just once a day and
still want to, well, it's first come on so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have the next 23 hours to dry
that out and get back to a dry period.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm definitely not trying to sit there and
just keep the medium soaked for a week
[SPEAKER_00]: straight, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the first couple of days,
I will way overwater the pots to literally
[SPEAKER_00]: just get them to the point where they're
just flushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after that, I'll just continue to
water for another, until I see yellowing
[SPEAKER_00]: happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not all genetics will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some genetics where I flushed it
for weeks and they just would not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like after weeks, they would finally start
to give me a little something.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, dude, I know through labs that
I don't need to flush this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like labs have shown me that past five
days, you're technically passing any lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be nothing that's showing up on
the parts per million or parts per billion
[SPEAKER_00]: in their given fields of where the ranges
are for safety or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like after five days, at least
with our nutrients, the way we do it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've gone two weeks just to see,
and there are a few genetics that won't
[SPEAKER_00]: fade, but I would say nine out of 10
genetics will show you a fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that you'll start to see the plant
from the tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like yellow out and you'll see the green
in the plant, the chlorophyll start to
[SPEAKER_00]: deplete out of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll just start to have this
beautiful fade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are more beautiful, some are kind of
ugly, but you'll just have a fade happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when you know like,
yeah, the plant's now basically starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to eat itself because there's nothing
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no nutrients anywhere for it to
absorb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can safely pull it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, flushing is a super hot topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people like to talk about
flushing and some people flush,
[SPEAKER_01]: some people don't flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know in the comments section
below for those folks that are tuning into
[SPEAKER_01]: this on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: In particular, comment below and let us
know if you flush.
[SPEAKER_01]: If so, how do you go about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't flush, why don't you flush?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's spark some debate, friendly debate
in the comment section here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few more questions for you
before I let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know about common mistakes that
are made when growing in Rockwell and how
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be avoided.
[SPEAKER_01]: Break it down for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, under watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, and over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people that won't understand that
hydro does not retain, not hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: that Rockwell does not retain water like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll maybe go into it with an idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're somebody like, all right,
I'll paint two scenarios.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're already a grower that you may want
to switch to hydro, specifically Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you come from soil or cocoa where water
will retain for a little bit, then
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally you're going to assume that
water will retain in the hydro or
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to water every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under watering for sure is a killer
right away because there's no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you forget or skip a pot, good luck
that next day that plant's dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the later in life they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe if they're clones, possibly if
they're blocks, you can go back and try to
[SPEAKER_00]: save a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, once they're in pots, if you miss
a date, they're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, under watering is big and over
watering because most people that grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro, traditionally speaking,
in my experience of what I've seen around
[SPEAKER_00]: gardens, nobody is hand watering hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all hooking up drip systems of
some sort or drain the waste or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of that over watering too,
it's a super bad thing with hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people do it because the first thing
people think to do when they set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro system is how can I set up
irrigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could rewire your mind and not
think irrigation just because it's hydro
[SPEAKER_00]: and instead think, well, no, let me still
try to apply classic rowing principles,
[SPEAKER_00]: i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: potting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that a lot of people
don't do in hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pot so that I can develop a root mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like little things like that where
if you just kind of don't think hydro and
[SPEAKER_00]: just think rowing the same way that if
you've grown before, you will continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're new to it, then also don't
run to a drip system because you should
[SPEAKER_00]: learn your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to learn your plants is
to see them every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best way to see them every day is
to have no choice but to walk up to that
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and water it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, there's just so many pros to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other cons would be understanding that
you have no buffer with pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big, big thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning, if you want to monitor
your PPMs and your EC, do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not somebody that says, don't do it,
shame on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason those numbers exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a reason that they're correlated
to certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to take a more scientific
approach as you learn to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because growing in hydro, generally
speaking, is a much more scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methodology of growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're already doing that if you're
choosing to take the steps to grow in
[SPEAKER_00]: hydro, specifically rockwool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding that pH is not your
friend if you mess it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with your overall EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically anything, again,
if you're coming from in a world where you
[SPEAKER_00]: are an experienced grower going,
trying to transition into something that
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe is a little easier on your back or
something like that, yeah, just all the
[SPEAKER_00]: buffers that you have in what you do
currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to apply in hydro,
specifically in rockwool at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize that you got to be on your.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then outside of that, if you're new to
it altogether, I honestly tell people to
[SPEAKER_00]: stray away from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily think beginner growers
should do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they can do hydro, but they
shouldn't necessarily grow how I grow
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is very, very dependent on you
understanding how to read your plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing when you're messing something up,
or just more importantly, even down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: fundamentals of understanding what you're
doing to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the pH mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does too acidic or too alkaline even
mean in relation to the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, there's a lot more in-depth
understanding that you have to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: successfully do this unless you were to
follow my recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I just handed you my recipe,
told you to buy my lights, my medium,
[SPEAKER_00]: my everything, and just do this,
you're going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're just starting out and you
hear this podcast and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I kind of want to try that,
then yeah, just respect the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will have to have a natural,
better understanding and a much sharper
[SPEAKER_00]: eye and a much, much greater attention to
detail of the plants so that you can see
[SPEAKER_00]: those little things that are onsets to you
messing something up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of tips there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Man, this has been very insightful for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a soil grower as much as you hate
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to admit I'm a soil grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hearing about the differences,
it's very interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used Rockwell cubes just to start
seeds, clones, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've never done a whole grow with
Rockwell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen your grows and they're
beautiful, but I've never done it myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really cool to sit down with you
today and hear about how you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell the listeners how they can
find you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, firstly, bro, let me just say thank
you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: As somebody that's respected by a lot of
people in the community, the fact that you
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate what I'm doing and that you
look at my gardens and you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: knocks on them, I appreciate it,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for having me on here and
just thank you for just considering me an
[SPEAKER_00]: equal, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I respect what you do, for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as getting in touch with me and
whatnot, we don't have... So I'm now
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to say this on every podcast
because I've been finding out that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are creating telegrams and saying they're
me and doing a bunch of really fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: and taking money from people and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just we have no telegrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not just saying this is not a
ploy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no telegrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no Snapchats.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way you can contact me unless
you go to my Swank Genetics Instagram or
[SPEAKER_00]: Swank Tools Instagram or the Swank
Collection Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you even try to ask me for
products, I'm just going to block you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's so many people that can attest
to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the last six years that have been
trying to get in touch with me that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you want garden talk,
if you want to just chop it up about
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, if I can help you in any way,
that's what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's way too much gatekeeping in
this community and way too much people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I have a problem with because all
they want to do is act like their tech is
[SPEAKER_00]: something special.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's all grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit me up for reasons like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hit me up because you think I'm a
trapper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't hit me up because you think you're
going to get plugged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit me up because you want to learn and
you want to talk plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll definitely have a link to your
Instagram down in the YouTube description
[SPEAKER_01]: section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're on one of the podcast
platforms, just search for them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I see you've been making waves
amongst several podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're on From the Stash,
like I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link that episode down in the,
well, two episodes actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll link it down in the YouTube
description section below so people can go
[SPEAKER_01]: to those episodes next.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're also on Goblin's channel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I caught that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You made an appearance on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely want to give a shout out to our
Patreon folks as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those folks that are supporting this
podcast are Patreon.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% of the money that gets donated
through Patreon goes right back into the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Helps keep the lights on in the studio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm putting names on the screen right now
for those folks that are on the producer
[SPEAKER_01]: tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Special thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris, once again, thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'll let you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
