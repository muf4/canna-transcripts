[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka MrGrowit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're watching my actress channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got a PAR test video for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ES300 version 2 by the Green
Sunshine Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also called the Electric Sky 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually sent this growlite over to
me, and in this video I'm gonna test the
[SPEAKER_00]: PAR output.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did do a PAR test for the ES300 V1.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking for that video,
I will put a card in the top right corner
[SPEAKER_00]: of the screen right now, and also post it
in the outro card of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've also provided me a discount code
for my viewers, so you can get a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage off plus free shipping
depending on what country you live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will provide a link to this growlite in
the description section below along with
[SPEAKER_00]: the discount code.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the PAR test, I'm gonna use the Apogee
MQ500 PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 389 nanometers to
692 nanometers plus or minus 5 nanometers,
[SPEAKER_00]: and measurements are in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really this video is just to give you
a general idea of what the PAR output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have this growlite in a grow tent
which has reflective walls that could
[SPEAKER_00]: increase the numbers, so just keep that in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The coverage area for this growlite is two
foot by four foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say that you can extend it to two and
a half feet by five feet, but I do have
[SPEAKER_00]: this in a two foot by four foot grow tent,
and that's what I'll be taking
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in for this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like all the other PAR test videos
that I do, I'll let the measurements do
[SPEAKER_00]: the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know in the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty much it for this video guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you enjoyed please click that thumbs
up, and I will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching,
and until next time, peace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching guys.
Thanks for watching guys.
I'll see you in the next one.
Bye.
