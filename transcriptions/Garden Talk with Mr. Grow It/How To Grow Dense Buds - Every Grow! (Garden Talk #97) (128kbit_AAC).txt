[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let something veg longer,
ultimately your cola will be larger,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that doesn't necessarily mean it will
be denser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can achieve the same density
with all the same conditions on a small
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that last little 5% on your gas
pedal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're almost to the floor,
you've got everything cruising down the
[SPEAKER_01]: freeway perfectly, and you just hit it and
you just sink a little bit lower and you
[SPEAKER_01]: take off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger the roots, the bigger the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, get your root zone on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only going to be able to bring in
more food and nutrients for the buds,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they will be denser because of a
healthier root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individually, there isn't like a silver
bullet out there of, if I just add this
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometer, it's going to be poof.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me, my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow
[SPEAKER_00]: It, and you're tuned into the Garden Talk
podcast, this episode number 97.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Chad
Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for 13 years,
and he grows a variety of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is the host of several different shows
on both the FCP and FCP2 channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and he's actually been on the podcast once
before, episode 25, where he talks all
[SPEAKER_00]: about bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, we get into growing dense
buds, something that a majority of people
[SPEAKER_00]: are looking to do, but it's easier said
than done.

[SPEAKER_00]: Before we get into it, I want to
acknowledge that one of my goals for this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast is to bring free gardening
information of all plants to the general
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, I'd like to thank the
sponsors of today's episode who helped
[SPEAKER_00]: make that goal possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks to AC Infinity for sponsoring this
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They now have supplemental lighting,
called the Ion Beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the Ion Beam S11 grow light bars,
which are 11 inches long and use Samsung
[SPEAKER_00]: LM301H diodes, but they also have the Ion
Beam S16, which are 16 inches long and use
[SPEAKER_00]: the same diodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes with a light controller with four
light intensity levels and timer settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: their supplemental lighting and the
discount code MrGrowIt15 works on both
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazon and their website, ACInfinity.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've actually been on the podcast
before, episode 25, and you talked all
[SPEAKER_00]: about bricks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of good information on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you missed it, you may want to
listen to that episode after this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: In today's episode, we're going to talk
about growing dense buds and I know not
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody listening to this episode cares
about bud structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually had a large handful of
people tell me they like loose,
[SPEAKER_00]: airy buds, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to jump to the assumption
that everybody wants to grow dense buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: but there's certainly a significant amount
of people out there who do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and thanks for having me back on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hi everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chad Westport.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a longtime grower with experience of
indoor and outdoor garden beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've done this commercially, but my
passion lies with home cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be nutrient-rich food or just
the best medicinal plants you can possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm into helping people get that process
started because I feel it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start with genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, genetics, genetics that can
certainly impact dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to us about genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, genetics and actually I'm going
to play off something that you just said
[SPEAKER_01]: here too, which is part of genetics,
but it's breeders directions and breeders
[SPEAKER_01]: intentions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I come from a day where, you know,
larger was better, bigger was better.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanted dense and you wanted large
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what caught people's eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, today things are kind of changing
and there's different uses for medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these get turned into concentrated
forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, dense flower structures
aren't the best producers when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: getting that type of material.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the open loose stuff that has access
to all of the trichome heads on the
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers that they're able to get instead
of it being stuck in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, genetics plays a big role in it
and breeders intentions are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: breed towards maybe a more open or airy
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, traditionally you can think of,
you know, it's hard for me to say this
[SPEAKER_01]: with a straight face because there's a lot
of polyhybrids today.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really true indicas or true
sativas anymore in the traditional sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we use that as a starting point for
the conversation, you're going to find
[SPEAKER_01]: that indica plants tend to be a little bit
more dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a little bit shorter, whereas
sativa plants tend to grow a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: taller and they tend to have a little bit
more of an open structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is just kind of their,
you know, the region of origin.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these sativas are equatorial
where it's a lot hotter down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The open structure helps them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an advantage to the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of an offensive mechanism,
defensive mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what you would call it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does, you know, it keeps it from
overheating amongst other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas some of the shorter indicas,
they're from colder regions with higher
[SPEAKER_01]: elevations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to finish faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So genetic wise, indica and sativa do kind
of play a difference in all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, to get back to the first
part is, you know, just the morphology of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some plants, they have conical shaped
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others just have golf ball shaped flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just kind of the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're not really going to change it
regardless of what you do there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you mentioned, indica is kind of being
more dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have a cross called Chilote OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I did was I had a brisker OG by
Square One Genetics crossed out with
[SPEAKER_00]: Pakistan Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pakistan Valley is a hundred percent
indica land race strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe that's where the bud density,
because every single plant I grew out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this cultivar has just been dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be coming from that indica
side of things, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although the brisker, that also has some
density as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, pretty dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty interesting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the Pakistanis, the Hindu Kush,
the Afghans, a lot of those that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, higher elevation cold weather,
those are, you know, dense, dense flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are there any specific breeders that
come to mind that have cultivars that
[SPEAKER_00]: dense up nicely?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I kind of lean back to
maybe some of the older breeders or people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are working with older cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Duke Diamond from Old Dominion is one that
comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: He worked with a lot of the skunk flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is kind of an older morphology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an older structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we see that in a lot of his work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, today there's a lot of things
that are purple.
[SPEAKER_01]: There wasn't so much purple back in the
90s or, you know, even before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you often see a lot of green in those
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, Top Dog Seeds, JJ, he works
with sours.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a New York guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another one that just tends to
be particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see chunky on the vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: AK Beanbrains, Skunk Vier, these are a
couple of the older breeders working with
[SPEAKER_01]: more traditional lions that, yeah,
it's pretty much always chunky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know people listening in,
they're shopping for good genetics that
[SPEAKER_00]: they know dense up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I figured it would be good to name some
of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: One that comes to mind for me is square
one genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything I've grown out from square one
genetics has been dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the density actually runs from the top
all the way down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I've had plants that I grew that I
didn't do lollipopping to try to get off
[SPEAKER_00]: any of that larf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet those buds on the bottom were dense,
a real dense rock hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the genetics that are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love having genetics that are dense
all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that square one genetics is
definitely one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's get into different things in
regards to growing the plants that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to help with bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to bud density, are there
types of light that help with bud density?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun is obviously number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say we've got the right genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sun, that's what we're trying to
duplicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But whether it's like a HPS, ceramic metal
halide, LED, the one real factor that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to make a large difference is the
intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do it with all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the intensity of them that I
think are going to make the difference of
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's dense or not, if the
potential exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, again, is intensity is just the
strength, the amount of usable light that
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant can get, but also heat too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where HPS or the high intensity
discharges were a little bit different
[SPEAKER_01]: than the current model of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HPSs would get a lot hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to run it a little bit
further, which would get you less of that
[SPEAKER_01]: intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas LEDs are a little bit cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can run it a little bit closer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get that intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So intensity is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs, easy to achieve the right conditions
all around for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you got the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a good example is CFLs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You try growing plants under CFLs
flowering there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get nearly as good as
density as you would with a full spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes down to, like people say,
it comes down to the intensity,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The amount of PAR coming down on the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first two official, technically,
literally, closet grows with CFL bulbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is possible, but you'll notice a
difference when you step up your lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what about the spectrum of light?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that blue light could
contribute to more airier buds versus red
[SPEAKER_00]: in the spectrum, which more red in the
spectrum towards flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's often said that that helps with bud
development, bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on all that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the cherry picking of
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned red and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go back five years,
we're talking LEDs, we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: blurples, which is that combination of the
red and blue lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are studies that absolutely say red
light and I mean, it's proven,
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely show that red light can,
you know, promote bud set, promote
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also absolutely papers that say
blue light is great because it keeps the
[SPEAKER_01]: stomata open, which means it can transpire
more and it could get more CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just if you cherry pick that,
you'd be like, well, all I need is a red
[SPEAKER_01]: and a blue light, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's monochromatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have run tests and they said,
no, we can't just run red.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just run blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we put the two together,
that's where the whole kind of the blurple
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've advanced since then white light,
white light captures all of the spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with a white light, you look at
the box, you look at your light or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, HPS, the bulbs, you'll see that
chart on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have the wave.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have the color spectrums.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see that, you know, red and blue
are both kind of almost equally
[SPEAKER_01]: represented and everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those can be a benefit to the plants
and to the growth and denser buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But individually, there isn't like a
silver bullet out there of if I just add
[SPEAKER_01]: this nanometer, it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that far red into IR,
like above what I want to say above 730
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start talking about the Emerson effect
having a combination of that spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the other spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's over 5%, plants are more prone to
foxtailing in flowering is one thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: I had learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember back when the electric sky ES
300, the V1, I think they had 7% or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: even 10% far red IR in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, when you get towards
into flowering and you get these
[SPEAKER_00]: foxtailing, things become more airier and
looser.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if you've had any
experience with that or if you've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've not had experience with it directly,
but it would kind of make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking back again to the
equatorial sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I just believe that there is
more of that IR in that region of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just again, how the sun and the angle of
all that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, to your point, you need very
little of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to have a full board
dedicated to, you know, everything 730 and
[SPEAKER_01]: above.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit goes a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into environment that can
certainly have an impact on bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about what is VPD and how does
that impact bud density?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So VPD is kind of a, it's a measure of the
amount of moisture in the air versus the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential that the air can absorb.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of a calculation of
humidity and temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having a target VPD is something that is
going to help the plant grow and the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: dense up because it encourages
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transpiration is just plant sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we sweat through our pores,
plants sweat through their stomata.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have the right VPD, they're able
to sweat because the moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: the kilopascals is the technical
measurement of it, but the air pressure or
[SPEAKER_01]: the water pressure in the air is less than
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it escapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it escapes, it draws up water and
nutrients from the roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by kind of manipulating your VPD and
keeping the plant in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a desired range, not a sauna, but you
know, when you sit in a sauna,
[SPEAKER_01]: you sweat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you kind of keep the plant in a,
in a good range where it's actively
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping the stomata open and drawing
nutrients from the root zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will help build denser buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually had experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in a very dry climate, natural
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking at it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 26% right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reaches down to the teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And upwards of 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm always adding in humidity right
into my grow, but I've certainly grown
[SPEAKER_00]: plants under this humidity, you know,
very low humidity under 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately the lower the humidity
increases the transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned, increases the
uptake and actually, well, first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can lead to toxicity issues if you have
a overabundance of nutrients in the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium, but it unfortunately has resulted
in airier buds for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I think it's just a matter of just
increased transpiration, but just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: forming and flying all over the place at
so much of a rapid rate that's not able to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep its density.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just me kind of speculating,
but the low humidity definitely impacts
[SPEAKER_00]: bud production in a negative way,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I shouldn't say negative way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause again, I go back to the folks that
are okay with the airier buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: the looser buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just say that the low humidity
environments can certainly contribute to
[SPEAKER_00]: non-dense buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a place where if it goes below 50,
it's freezing cold winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of in a lucky zone where 60,
it just kind of hangs out at 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that really helps me with my drawing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another topic though.
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 is another thing that is involved with
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can supplementing CO2 impact the bund
density at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of things that you would
want to have in place for CO2 use.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I'll just touch on that first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want kind of a sealed environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us exhaust the areas where our
gardens are.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're just quickly turning that out
every 30 seconds to a minute, it might not
[SPEAKER_01]: be as beneficial as if you slowed that
down or it was a sealed environment where
[SPEAKER_01]: it kind of recycled that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a benefit either way,
whether it's sealed or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also need to have a powerful
enough light, powerful enough light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're going back to intensity and
we're going to go back to temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: because yes, CO2 can help build denser
buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It increases the, or it opens the stomata,
which allows for more CO2 uptake,
[SPEAKER_01]: which again, transpiration, more
nutrients, but it also accelerates
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really the driving factor
behind all of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we want the intense light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because we want to create
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to help cells multiply a little
bit faster than if you didn't have CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of this is just kind of a,
it's that last little 5% on your gas
[SPEAKER_01]: pedal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're almost to the floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got everything cruising down the
freeway perfectly and you just hit it and
[SPEAKER_01]: you just sink a little bit lower and you
take off.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some ways that home growers can
supplement CO2 without breaking the bank?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I am talking a lot,
whether it be on a webcast, on a phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so sometimes if you're in a small
enough room, just ambient levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, if you talk a lot or if you like to
sing to your plants, you can increase CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: in a meaningful way there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there are also, um, bottles that you
could get small canisters, almost like the
[SPEAKER_01]: size of a two liter or, um, you know,
smaller that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful with CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a toxic deadly gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it accumulates, uh, in a large enough
amount, it likes to sit low to a floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're using it, definitely have a
monitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but one of the most popular things or
common things I see amongst, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, hobby growers is mushroom bags,
something like that in their tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they just kind of hang it up high,
kind of let it fall down over the canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's typically the,
uh, most common one I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what about the tanks?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I hear people go into the hydro
store and lugging tanks into other house
[SPEAKER_00]: and then put in that crow space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you recommend against doing that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was mushroom bags better or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, in a sealed environment with
the tanks, you're able to control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to set kind of a target.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas with the bags, you're just like
taking what you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it's going to, you know, probably
start off high and then decrease over time
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot faster than a tank where you could
set it at a particular level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, really the size of the
garden, I think we would dictate something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, a lot of hobbyists typically don't
need that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people who, um, you know,
have, have a different garden or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe medicinal gardens,
something with a little bit more power.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could benefit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth it if you meet all the other
conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if you don't have, you know,
light intensity, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause you need to run the plants
hotter, the room a little bit hotter when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're running CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to summarize all those things swirling
in my head right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used the mushroom bags as well as the
canisters in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of those have worked to increase the
CO2 level in my environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, uh, surprisingly, so I do have a CO2
monitor in my grow at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, surprisingly, every time I go in
there, it's like over 800 and I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: about why would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would that be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of things that people don't
think about is I live in the house that I
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like I'm exhaling CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: My girlfriend is exhaling CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: My three cats are exhaling CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you've got that intake coming,
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're exhausting the air out of the
grow space, bringing in fresh air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing it passively and there's fresh
CO2 coming in at all times and it keeps it
[SPEAKER_00]: up 800 plus just about every time I go in
there it's 800 plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I don't need to supplement
CO2 anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've tried it, it's helped and so
on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm at the point where I'm such a
small home girl only growing six to 12
[SPEAKER_00]: plants at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I don't need to spend that
extra money on supplementation that my air
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm exhaling is providing enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I said I grew commercially
and commercially if you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: a large nursery and you're able to
increase yield by say two grams per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me and you, for the hobbyists,
not really a big deal might not be worth
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost or the expense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you do that on scale times 20,
30, 40, 50,000, that adds up real quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's kind of one of those last
little things that you can toy around with
[SPEAKER_01]: and in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can certainly have an impact on bud
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about proper plant nutrition to
ensure a bud density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the probably a good example or an
easy example of is this a real thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go into any growth store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at any line of nutrients that you
see, whether it be organic, non-organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a bloom and there's always
a veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we've been trained to look
at those three numbers, the N,
[SPEAKER_01]: the P, the K, nitrogen, nitrogen,
potassium, phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at those bottles,
you will see that these numbers do vary
[SPEAKER_01]: between the flower and the veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main things that you want to
kind of cut off when you transition is
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen can kind of promote some like
cell elongation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can make things basically grow a little
bit more where we want to focus more on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bud production, not so much of stretch
or size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, nutrients can absolutely do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nitrogen being probably one of the main
ones, one of the obvious ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also some time in increased demand
for potassium and flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of helps things bulk up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, I've been guilty of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen different products in the garden
store where, you know, it's like zero
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen, like 50 P 50 K.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, that's going to knock it
out of the park, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Balance balance is so important when it
comes to any nutrient program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't want to throw anything out of
whack just because it wants more
[SPEAKER_01]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just feed a whole bunch of potassium
and nothing else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nutrients wise, those are the two
micro or macro nutrients that really can
[SPEAKER_01]: have an effect on your blood density.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a horror story when it comes to
too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way back then, when I first started,
I was using bottled nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the Fox farm trio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I started out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And good, good lineup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had some really good results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I got overconfident early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I was first, I was checking
the PPM and pH and all that stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: things were good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my next grow, I was
overconfident.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, I don't need to check pH and
PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to read the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I overfed early in veg and my
actually into veg into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was still continuing to feed,
especially cal mag is another thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because some cal mags do have a nitrogen
in it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to really be careful with cal
mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people cut off cal mag for the
first three weeks of flowering to make
[SPEAKER_00]: sure they're not feeding too much nitrogen
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was ignorant to the fact that I had
nitrogen toxicity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had nitrogen toxicity going into
flower and then it was like week four,
[SPEAKER_00]: five.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, what's up with these buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are kind of weird looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't how my other buds look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no, it was too much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering loose, airy buds, just
disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately there was no way of
rebounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in week five, week six of flower and
flushed the plant, but it was a lost
[SPEAKER_00]: cause.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent the last couple of weeks,
the buds kind of dead stuff a little bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it was still nowhere near as it should
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the final product was horrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up, actually it affected the taste
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely affected the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was gross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I threw away most of the harvest
unfortunately because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm glad you mentioned nitrogen as far
as impacting bud structure and the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: density, because it absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to make sure that going into
flower, you don't have an abundance of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also glad you mentioned potassium
towards the end of flowering because a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people do use that in the final few
weeks to bulk up those flowers and dense
[SPEAKER_00]: up those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another thing, you mentioned don't
overdo it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to figure out how much should
you be adding in towards the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering to make sure you're not
overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have an imbalance of nutrients in
the medium, for example, too much
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium could lock out some of the other
cations, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Calcium, magnesium, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So balance, balance, balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But certainly if you are a precision
grower, you precision feeding throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the grow, you can tinker with the
nutrition in order to try to achieve a
[SPEAKER_00]: better bud density.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you kind of hit on one of the hidden
things too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned the cow mag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look on the back of a lot of
your different supplemental bottles,
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium and magnesium being one of them,
you'll see like it's either calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate or calcium sulfite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, that's where sometimes the
nitrate is the nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where that can sneak into the
program accidentally is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're kind of topping it on and to,
you know, look at the bottles to see if it
[SPEAKER_01]: already has calcium and magnesium in it as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, those were things that I
learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, I guess, hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I learned over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, really good call outs for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Size of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I released a video talking about why I
grow small plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was some people in there that
there was the debate in the comment
[SPEAKER_00]: section about quality versus quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people in there that say I'd
rather grow small plants with dent buds
[SPEAKER_00]: versus larger plants with looser buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the site of the plant relate to how
dense the buds will be at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of a two parter answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The natural size of it, if it was left,
you know, in the wild, sativas,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, are typically taller than the
indicas are shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that sense, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the probably the more applicable
sense of like, if I grow it a foot tall or
[SPEAKER_01]: if I grow it three feet tall, regardless
of whether it's indica, sativa or hybrid,
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't think so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of like to grow small plants as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives me more control over the amount
of harvests and varieties I can have per
[SPEAKER_01]: year versus taking more time and growing a
longer vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to have, if you let
something veg longer, ultimately your cola
[SPEAKER_01]: will be larger, but that doesn't
necessarily mean it will be denser.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you can achieve the same density
with all the same conditions on a small
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown small plants with airy buds and
I've grown larger plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in my personal opinion, when I was a
home grower, like a five foot plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of larger for me and had
dense buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I completely agree with you that I
don't think the actual size of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be the determining factor of
whether or not the plant has dense buds or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, don't, you know,
don't get it confused with yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: A larger plant will have a larger yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but again, sometimes quality is the
essence, or, you know, in my case,
[SPEAKER_01]: I need variety and I like to have it
frequently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do it faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just shorter plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about plant training?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about low stress training,
topping, supercropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does any of that stuff impact bud density
at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: It does in the sense that, so basically
the common theme amongst all of those the
[SPEAKER_01]: topping, uh, low stress trainings,
supercropping, you're trying to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: level canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and one thing that a level cam canopy
promotes is the even distribution of
[SPEAKER_01]: auxins.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically the energy, the go juice in the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you, if you grew it like a Christmas
tree, all of the auxins are going towards
[SPEAKER_01]: that apical meristem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going towards the very top.
[SPEAKER_01]: All plants are this way because it sends
the most energy to the top because it
[SPEAKER_01]: wants to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or get pollinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where it all happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but when we lay it down, it's an even
redistribution because they're all the
[SPEAKER_01]: top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wants, the plant wants to give each
of them an equal chance to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does create denser buds in the sense
that yes, hormonally, they're all getting
[SPEAKER_01]: the same amount of, you know, energy juice
as the catchall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So scientific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but also with the level canopy,
you were able to get the light closer to
[SPEAKER_01]: all of them instead of having one flower
here and one flower here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an equal measurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to give them the same amount
of intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, plant training in those ways can
help you get denser buds secondarily.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what about some of the plant
pruning techniques such as lollipopping?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you often hear about that as,
uh, you know, getting rid of that larf on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom there and promoting the bud
density at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lollipopping and I want to throw
defoliating in there as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do those things contribute to bud density?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and just kind of the logic of
lollipopping to me is, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: there, there's only a hundred percent of
energy a plant can expend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you have 50 places for that a
hundred percent of energy to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: it goes there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you remove some of those and give,
you know, that a hundred percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy, 30 places to go, it's going to
give the places it's going more energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, it takes away, uh, if you
lollipop, it spends less energy trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow those lower shoots, lower flowers,
sends that energy to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, defoliation is catch 22 there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think anybody successfully proved
anybody right or wrong here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There, there's definitely some thoughts to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's, here's mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, defoliation can help in a sense of
getting light to lower bud sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, if it's a certain amount of
distance away from the light source,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why we lollipop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to bring everything up towards the
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but there's a sink in a source
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the leafs photosynthesize and people
are like, well, photosynthesis is the
[SPEAKER_01]: power that drives it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This photosynthesis photosynthesis
basically turns everything into sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The sinks are some of the oldest older
leafs they sink or they, they take more
[SPEAKER_01]: than they generate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the new leafs, they're generating
a lot of sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my opinion, at the point of where it
becomes a sink versus a source,
[SPEAKER_01]: like sometimes you get older, thicker,
yellower leafs towards the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll remove those because I don't think
it's generating more sugars than it's
[SPEAKER_01]: taking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that essence, it's going to send
that away to the other areas, but
[SPEAKER_01]: production that needs more sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and I do know that it has been shown
that when you do, you know, lollipopping
[SPEAKER_01]: or taking off side branches, which is a
little bit more drastic than defoliation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but similar thought there, um,
those sugars do get redirected to
[SPEAKER_01]: auxiliary tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I think they help as a long
answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, but they do help, uh,
in both instances, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an interesting perspective on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I just want to add to the
lollipopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you kind of touched on this is
the, the lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lower branches aren't receiving as
much light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to emphasize that because in
the beginning of the episode, we talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about low light levels contributing to the
loosier, airier buds, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not receiving the light that it
needs down towards the bottom of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to dense up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, genetics, genetics,
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had some cultivars that even with
those low levels of light, they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: going to dense up at the bottom and be
rock hard and, and really nice buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you did find a gem there because that
is kind of the rarity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, the saying, nobody likes to
trim larv.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we lollipop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I firmly put myself in that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no patience for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, I just feel that without it,
more energy will go to the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess to, to kind of frame my
answer, my answer is always, I'm always
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking the top, the top, the top,
not necessarily what was below.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a viewer question here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stem splitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will stem splitting result in denser buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, actually just take a step
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us what stem splitting is?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then answer whether or not it helps
with bud density.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, the, the most common,
uh, stem splitting I've seen is people
[SPEAKER_01]: driving a nail or something through the
bottom stock as they get close to harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, to kind of split it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you talking about it in that
sense or maybe like a mainlining sense
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're snapping them earlier on?
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about doing actual stem
splitting where they're shoving a nail in
[SPEAKER_00]: and they say that the stress on the plant
causes the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: To dense up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely creating a plant
stressor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't think that is going to dense
your buds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do know controlled stress can create
different results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it's in the form of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I'm just going to say no
altogether to this one, but, but being
[SPEAKER_01]: technical, yes, things like water stress,
it'll increase the cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not the biomass volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does nothing for your bud density.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's older than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there anything else that can help
with bud density that we didn't cover in
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I did, I did have a couple
of things that came up to the top of my
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're talking light intensity,
spacing, spacing in your tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, um, because plants will have this
thing called shade avoidance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, if they're all flowering and they're
all very close together, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: each one wants to get above the other to
get the most light, the most intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in a really cramped area,
your plants are going to be trying to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: up instead of put on the flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So spacing is one thing that could do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, patience, patience with your harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you know, the old saying is when you
think it's done, wait another week,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, inspect your trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see huge amounts of,
uh, difference between usually one week or
[SPEAKER_01]: the next at the very end.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were, if you had a flower that
was truly 11 weeks and at nine weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're just waiting to pull it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you let it go full term, you're going
to have denser buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I guess the last thing too,
and this is something that you could focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on earlier in the, in the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, your root zone, bigger the roots,
the bigger the fruits.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get your root zone on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's only going to be able to bring in
more food and nutrients for the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and they will be denser because of a
healthier root system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the last few things that I
kind of had there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about the products that are on the
market that people are, uh, some products
[SPEAKER_00]: being sold that people say this is going
to help with bud density.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on those?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't name of any right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't think of any and, and name them,
but there are some out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen them and yeah, I mean,
we can probably picture the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, no, I, I buy a lot of this as snake
juice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I've tried a lot of different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, you know, 20% more yields,
40% more yield as compared to what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: first question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I do like to A and B a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've also done this with, you know,
lollipopping all the way down versus not
[SPEAKER_01]: majority of the time, especially with
these types of products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell you one way or the other,
like control a looks like control B at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's, there's very few things that
have made significant differences,
[SPEAKER_01]: but, um, no, one of the most common ones
though is probably again, photosynthesis,
[SPEAKER_01]: make sugars, plant likes the sugars,
makes it grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have talked about adding molasses
to the soil in the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the plant really isn't going to
benefit through the molasses, the
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a micro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organisms that make nutrients plant
available.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in a way, yes, that can help,
but that's not something that if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: not using like a heavy biologically active
soil, putting molasses in, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to make denser buds for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one thing that comes to mind for
me that, uh, people used to add in all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but it's very harmful to humans,
which is, I never pronounce this right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have information about that or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, this is a common farming product.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you actually go to Google and type in
exploding watermelons, China, you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the, this, they're PGRs, uh,
PGR, some are good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This follows under the really bad and
synthetic category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it just, it just, it just doesn't make
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just multiplies the cell so fast and
they fed this field of watermelons,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, some of this pack low, uh,
PGRs and the, the, it grew so fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: they exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, that's very harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, very harmful to humans, especially
when combusted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is, so that was one of the reasons
why I'm glad we have, um, markets for
[SPEAKER_01]: these safe markets, because that's a,
that's a product that was widely used in
[SPEAKER_01]: the past and it absolutely will not fly in
today's markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, yeah, don't use it kids,
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially on consumables, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some, I know they use a lot in
succulents to keep them small,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, uh, as far as using it on
consumables, unfortunately, it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: carcinogen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very harmful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So avoid that at all costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
