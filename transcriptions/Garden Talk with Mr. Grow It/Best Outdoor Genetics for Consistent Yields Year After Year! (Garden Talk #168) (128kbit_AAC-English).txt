[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_01]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: For those of you who don't know me,
my name is Chris, aka Mr. Grow It,

works for Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gets deep into genetics here,
with a focus on talking about some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best outdoor genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also get a little bit into how he grows
his plants outdoors.

[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much to invite us to your
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We follow you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: This should be an exciting one today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today we're going to talk about some of
the best outdoor genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some that can give big
harvests, consistent yields, and high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also may get into some tips for growing
them outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and how you got into
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm from Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work for the company for Dutch Passion
for 10 years already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started growing when I was more or
less 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started quite early because there,
where I was born, when I grew up,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was difficult to find good products
around to consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come from a small village close to
the mountains in the north of Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is that we started
collecting seeds, the first seeds that
[SPEAKER_00]: were sold by resellers in Italy from
Amsterdam were the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually my first plants, my first
seeds that I bought were Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years later, I started working with the
company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were growing guerrillas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were growing in the mountains,
up to the mountains, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from that on, I started to be really
passionate on growing because you never
[SPEAKER_00]: forget your first harvest and your first
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you get really, really
enthusiastic to the crop, to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where everything started for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you see the size, the size,
just the way it grows, when the flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: get on there, it's just, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even to this day, I still get excited
growing out different genetics because
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a variety in these genetics in
some grow better in some areas than other
[SPEAKER_01]: areas, which we're going to get into here
in a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So overall your gross style, are you a
hundred percent outdoors or do you do some
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor growing as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I started as an outdoor grower,
you know, like for necessity, let's say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I keep, for me, it's quite
romantic, you know, like to grow outdoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to see the plants with the wind,
you know, outside, you know, kissed by the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun, you know, like, and, and also growing
like with a huge sites, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you can really reach a big yielding
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also really clean products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I started, you know, to,
to, to do my, my experiments indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and then I became also really
passionate about indoor growing because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really control well the condition
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really, you can keep mothers,
you can keep the genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can, you can, you can start the
breeding, you know, like you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: playing with the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I, I still grow both, you know,
like more than outdoor, I became like more
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse, a glass house grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm both, you know,
like still, still mainly growing indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: lately, you know, like for necessity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also because I moved to Netherlands,
to, to Amsterdam where the company is
[SPEAKER_00]: based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also here there is not such a big
space to grow outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and also the climate, the weather we
can see later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why also the varieties are really,
really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outdoor varieties breed in,
in, in, in, in, in Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: The climate, the weather, it's not so easy
to grow outside in here around.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I can only imagine how crazy it can be
growing outdoors in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you soil or cocoa?
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you grow with organic inputs or
synthetic inputs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, I mostly do cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my favorite mix is between 50% light
mix soil and 50% cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, I really like it because I find
benefit from both.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can find a really nice development of
the roots, fast development, oxygen from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from the, from the cocoa, but still the
performing wise of the, of the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I became a real cocoa lover,
you know, like if I can say, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in indoor, because also I can control
well my irrigation and water in,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm yeah, 50% mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my, it's my favorite way to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see my plants really healthy and,
and I'm more organic growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I started with, with more
synthetics because I had the feeling that
[SPEAKER_00]: was easier, but actually then when you
start testing and try, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you see also that organic growing,
it's, it's, it's quite easy and the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial from my point of view,
from my harvest, the quality that I got
[SPEAKER_00]: from, from organics, it's really like a
top, top notch, you know, like terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: wise, especially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a handful of growers that do just
about exactly what you do where they mix
[SPEAKER_01]: up that soil like that and getting more
oxygen down in the root zone and maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more area of a medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can get some really big yields from
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there's one question I wanted to ask
you upfront here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want to get your input on you
working for Dutch Passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You, I know you have a lot of knowledge in
regards to what people are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: striving for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like more growers care less about
yield these days and are really focusing
[SPEAKER_01]: more on quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's really true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends, you know, like also the goal that
the grower have, you know, like there are
[SPEAKER_00]: many commercial grower that sometimes care
more on the, on the, on the quantity over
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality, over the quality,
but a main, you know, like a step by step,
[SPEAKER_00]: the culture and the knowledge about,
if we see the last 15 years, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: grown up a lot and really fast,
you know, so, you know, the smoke,
[SPEAKER_00]: the users, you know, like medical users
and not as looking for quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like if you do something,
do it well, you know, like you consume
[SPEAKER_00]: good products, you know, like safe
products, clean products, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like also because we, we all came from a
black market, you know, so people living
[SPEAKER_00]: in US or many, many countries of Canada
where, where now it's in many countries is
[SPEAKER_00]: legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we come from black market and,
and, and, you know, we smoked and we
[SPEAKER_00]: consumed some, some really bad,
bad quality weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people is going more for the quality
than for the quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then depends also in which countries,
because in the countries where it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the commercial grower take risk to,
you know, to grow big quantities and then,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally they go more for the,
for the quantity over the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the home grower, the basic home
growers, it's looking for mainly for the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality than, than for the quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lately we have a no labor wages and
technologies that can bring us to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: quite high quantity with, with high
quality, you know, so there is like a
[SPEAKER_00]: good, a good mix on, on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but definitely, you know, people are
really getting high culture on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's looking for the top, top quality,
top quality and clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really also like in the organic way
they, they look for, for, for really
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, clean products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the same way where I really strive more
for equality versus yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back in the day, when I first started
growing, I was striving for yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted the biggest plants I can get and
get the most yield that I possibly can.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me being a small home grower,
only growing for myself and I can gift
[SPEAKER_01]: here legally, I can gift to friends and
family and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to grow pounds and pounds and
pounds per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can get away with growing really less
than a pound per cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still enough for me to consume
between when I finished growing and when I
[SPEAKER_01]: complete my next growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I totally understand what you
mean, how you say, and that mostly home
[SPEAKER_01]: growers are going for that quality side of
things, because it's kind of easy to get
[SPEAKER_01]: the yield in order to last to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that depends also on the genetics,
you know, like there are genetics that are
[SPEAKER_00]: really well known to be like low yielding,
but you know, it's high quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also some genetics can give you big
yielding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still good quality, you know,
like top quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends also on the selection,
on how you grow it, where you grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So condition is almost really,
it's really, really important on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, quality over quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the tantrum in the last years for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you working for Dutch Passion,
one of the things you had mentioned kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of behind the scenes as we were exchanging
emails is that their genetics are bred in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about kind of what the
climate is there, you know, what those
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics really get put through?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we are, you know, Dutch Passion was
just to briefly introduce the company for
[SPEAKER_00]: who don't know them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the pioneer seed bank,
one of the oldest seed bank in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: still active on producing seeds,
was founded by Henk van Dahlen,
[SPEAKER_00]: a biologist from Amsterdam in 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started, actually his breeding
project started before the foundation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started to travel around in the late
70s in places like Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, Thailand, collecting original
landrace seeds from the landrace of that
[SPEAKER_00]: countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then coming back to Netherlands and
starting, you know, his breeding project,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the first experiments,
you know, because there were already sold
[SPEAKER_00]: by the coffee shops in the city centers
and in the cities of, of Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not so much produced in Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Main of the product that was sold in the
coffee shops around was imported by
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the sticky tie.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were, we call it like that because,
because, you know, that the sides of the,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body were closed in a, in a iron,
in iron to transport them in the boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like charas from India, you know,
like some, some extracts and also flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: from Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So was in South Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he started also with some friends,
with a group of friends that are people,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them are really well known in the
international industry because they
[SPEAKER_00]: started their own project or breeding or
fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, there are still many of them
active in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he start to produce flowers for the
coffee shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: He founded a coffee shop that was called
Homegrown Fantasy, Homegrown because it
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the first coffee shop in the
city center selling only Dutch flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not imported flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, like with,
with the knowledge of the, with the
[SPEAKER_00]: biologist school, you know, like he
started to, to do some testing and
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and, and he became like well
known in the, in the first network of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other coffee shop started to ask to
Hank, like if they can get some seeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there were many people in the
coffee shop asking for, for the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then he realized that could be exist
in the market about seeds, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, so it's time to, to produce seeds,
to reproduce and to select the first,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I connect to, to, to the main
topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the Dutch, the Dutch varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that varieties arrives from old school
land races cross and selected outdoor in
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that generation after generation,
that plants become stronger to the,
[SPEAKER_00]: to survive and flower in the Dutch
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dutch weather, for who don't know,
it's, it's like a really cold weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a short summertime with a lot of
hours of, of, of lights during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in September, so normally when in
Europe, you know, in December,
[SPEAKER_00]: you, you, you harvest in that late
September, beginning of October,
[SPEAKER_00]: you already have really low temperature,
so cold climate with wet, wet climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really hard to grow outdoor,
you know, up there, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands, it's all the Nordic country
of, of Europe, also north of Germany,
[SPEAKER_00]: Danish, you know, like Sweden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all this kind of Nordic countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spaceship create a full family
called the out, the Dutch outdoor family
[SPEAKER_00]: that are varieties are really vigorous and
strong for the, for the extreme outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: weathers as the Dutch, the Dutch weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are more resistant to the mold for
the high temperature, for the high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can stand more for the, and they can
flower really well in the, also in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cold climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, there is some, it's not,
it's not gonna go to, to grow strong and
[SPEAKER_00]: well below zero degrees there,
for example, but they can really stand on
[SPEAKER_00]: low, low temperature compared to the south
of Europe or other, other like a tropical
[SPEAKER_00]: or subtropical climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or inside of this family, there are some
of the legendary varieties of Dutch
[SPEAKER_00]: spaceship, like as a Durban poison,
one is worldwide well-known as a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: sativa from South Africa, from the Durban
city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Friesendieu, that was at the time was
calling in the eighties, this variety was
[SPEAKER_00]: called a purple star.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was back crossing with a,
with a skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a purple star with a,
with a skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really old school and strong plant,
like also with strange color, with nice
[SPEAKER_00]: color, like a purple color in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pink, purple, then that passion number
one, that have a cool story because it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: really fast variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can harvest it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In six, seven weeks of flower time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for outdoor, it's really suitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Tama was called, in our collection was
called this variety, Amstel Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Amstel, it's also like a brand of
a beer or the brand of the beer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like call it Hank and say,
hey, you cannot call a variety like,
[SPEAKER_00]: like our beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he had to call the name, change the
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he called it passion one, because it
was the first variety developed by Hank in
[SPEAKER_00]: the, in the eighties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's still, it's still available in
our, in our catalog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a Holland soap and a
really cool variety that I always
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned is a Friesian duck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the first project of an outdoor
variety, but camouflage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a variety that until the middle
flower time, you don't see and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize the plant as, as, because I have
this duck foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the leaf looks like a duck only,
only three point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like a duck foot leaf,
you know, like the sides of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a cross between Friesian dew
and a duck foot, duck foot, but like a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutant was the first project of mutant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that varieties can really stand well in
the outdoor growing in good condition,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like with nice weather and nice
climate condition can grow really
[SPEAKER_00]: vigorous, really strong with high
yielding, but can really stand well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perform also in a kind of extreme,
extreme weather, extreme condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those conditions that you mentioned there
seem like it's very taken the place
[SPEAKER_01]: through a rigorous time there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure they're going to be very
vigorous growth comes from being bred in
[SPEAKER_01]: those types of conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to imagine since it's being
cold, wet, real high humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: you mentioned there's got to be resistance
to pathogens like mold, botrytis,
[SPEAKER_01]: powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's got to be what, like your number
one thing that you guys look at when it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to selecting genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also because outdoor growing, you know,
like we always say, you know, like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a science, you know, like it's,
there is many ways, you know, like we
[SPEAKER_00]: always say, like there's a thousand roads
to go to Rome, you know, like there is
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many ways to grow outdoor,
to grow indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like of course, but there are some,
some common fact, you know, some,
[SPEAKER_00]: some common conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: That make you, make you, you know,
to give you the possibility to harvest a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice quality weed and, and to harvest
high, high quantity also from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from outdoor, from outdoor plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of these is choose properly the
genetics, not every genetic suitable for
[SPEAKER_00]: that, for every climate, you know,
especially in the outer, because outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: is not only growing, you are kind of
depending a lot on the weather and in your
[SPEAKER_00]: climate and the condition that you are
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is affect a lot because in the
indoor, you can control your climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can control that the weeks of,
of vegetative stage or flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can control almost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the outdoor, you can control till a
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're depending a lot, you know,
on the external conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a, that's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor growing is a whole different
battlefield compared to indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you, pests is another thing where
it's like, you have completely different
[SPEAKER_01]: pest prevention methods that you can take
indoors versus outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be a little bit more hands
off indoors versus outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned Holland's hope,
buddy of mine, pigeons 420, he raves about
[SPEAKER_01]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: He absolutely loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing but positive things to say about
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually I think I'm going to get
that in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if people are growing in the same
climate or they have a similar conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: to that, and they are striving after
yield, for example, what are some
[SPEAKER_01]: particular strains that you recommend that
they grow out?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the tropical environment, suitable,
the mostly Sativa we're talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: Mexico or the jungle in Columbia or
Thailand, you know, like close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Mekong river, for example, you know,
like all these, all these varieties are
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly Sativas with long period of flower
time and not so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, that's that's why it's
because, you know, there is normally high
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity, so it's really wet there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like the mold get inside
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your your your your body of flower,
it's super, super compact, compact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the mostly, let's say,
Iniga.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bred some varieties like Mazhar and
Master Kush, for example, or Nightwing
[SPEAKER_00]: that are all coming from Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are talking about a really high
temperature, so really warm climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally, especially during the day,
dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these varieties are suitable for like
more warmer climate, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like but but with low, constantly low
humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also something that can help to the
grower, you know, to choose the right the
[SPEAKER_00]: right the right variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have really an interesting family
that it's called the high altitude
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that are actually in our catalog
are two.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pamir Gold and Snow Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of them are bred and and and and
produced up to one thousand five hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: meters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's for the mountains, for the high
altitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we you know, we selected that in the
Alps of Switzerland, because the
[SPEAKER_00]: Netherlands doesn't have high mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did a project of breeding years ago
in the Alps of Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we produce these two.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stabilize these two varieties really,
really strong for the for the high
[SPEAKER_00]: altitude, the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's to say that if you are if you
grow in the mountain, really up to the
[SPEAKER_00]: mountain, if you don't have certain
conditions like in Malaya or in Nepal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like you have certain conditions
where the Sativas, the Indian Sativas can
[SPEAKER_00]: can grow really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put a strong indica in the
mountain, you can harvest that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's it's the hardest,
you know, like to you to get a really nice
[SPEAKER_00]: resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Pamir Gold and Snow Bob were bred
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's to say that it's not that you
cannot give a chance to this variety in
[SPEAKER_00]: not in their in in in their comfort zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's always better to choose something
that it's select for for that,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I don't think we talk
about enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is, hey, when you're selecting genetics,
select genetics that are good for your
[SPEAKER_01]: climate that you live in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned as an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you can control those conditions a
little bit more, but it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: super beneficial to really do the research
and figure out what the background is of
[SPEAKER_01]: those genetics and whether or not it's
applicable to where you're currently
[SPEAKER_01]: living.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I personally live in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned before we started recording
and it's very hot, very dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch Passion has some genetics that are
good for this particular climate,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you name off some genetics that are
good for those really warm, dry climates?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a banana blaze is one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a banana kush cross with mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mazar, it's our queen of the Indica's
var varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really strong plant that the name it's
also come from a village in Afghanistan
[SPEAKER_00]: called Mazari Sharif.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and that plant was land raised
there in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's really hard to get there because
there is a riot there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a fight between different
tributes, you know, like the different
[SPEAKER_00]: oppositions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Hank was there in the eighties
collecting that seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are varieties that really can
stand like really in a desertic,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost desert, let's say, area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good plant with a tall leaf,
you know, so really, really fat leaves,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that so it can transform easily
the light in the CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the photosynthesis, it's a plant
that can stand really well on the on the
[SPEAKER_00]: high temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, as I said before,
there is some there are some extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: condition that the plants cannot stand on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like if there is 60 degrees,
the plants don't see water for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants is going to die for sure,
you know, like.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the category and the families of
the genetics that we offer, that one,
[SPEAKER_00]: also the Night Queen, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Master Kush, it's it's another
really nice plant that can stand on this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of of condition, because I want to
say something that it's also like it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: point that we I think we have to touch
because it's it's the first phase of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, you know, so it's the germination
and vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a phase where the plant can can
suffer more because it's quite weak at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, you know, when when when the
root system, it's already developed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like and you put it in soil on
the ground outside, you know, then then
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants can can be strong and can
survive also to some disease or or bad bad
[SPEAKER_00]: condition in the climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when the plant is small, normally we
always recommend to start growing
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate and growing, you know,
like indoor or in a small greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like just to get more control in
the first phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the plant of the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of folks, they start growing
indoors, they'll veg for a certain period
[SPEAKER_01]: of time, and then they'll transition
outdoors for the exact reason that you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how long indoors do you recommend
that people veg for before transitioning
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants to outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's depends a little bit of where
and you're going to grow it and which
[SPEAKER_00]: residents you want to to get, you know,
like which sites of plants you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: get.
[SPEAKER_00]: But normally one month at least,
you know, what we recommend for a boost,
[SPEAKER_00]: the vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw cost, you know, like really
consistent better results and vigorous
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to transplant that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you germinate, you know, like in a
small pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after three weeks maximum,
you transplant the plant in a three
[SPEAKER_00]: liters, four liters pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you wait a little bit that the
root system start to develop a bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you can start putting outside the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that really can help you
to have a stronger plant when you put them
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the longer the plant has been
growing, the more chances it has a
[SPEAKER_01]: survival, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're taking a plant and you have it
growing, it sprouts and you got seven
[SPEAKER_01]: days, it's a little seedling and transfer
it to outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's going to be a lot less chance that
that's going to survive, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You depend on the wind, you depend on the
weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they are like really,
really, really weak at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like especially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also we're not talking just,
of course, an LED indoor would be the top
[SPEAKER_00]: notch, you know, like a starting point,
but also like a small greenhouse with some
[SPEAKER_00]: control, with some extra light,
like simple light, like quite,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite cold light, like 6,000 Kelvin,
you know, like nothing special,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like that without so many vats,
you know, like you don't need a super
[SPEAKER_00]: technology LED, but just to get the plants
used and to be covered, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be safe, you know, to start the process
of growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now transitioning from the indoors to the
outdoors, some folks will do a hardening
[SPEAKER_01]: off process, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll either take their plant indoors,
bring it outdoors for a certain period of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, then bring it back indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be going back and forth,
or some folks will take it indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: put it outdoors, but they'll put it in the
shade for a certain period of time versus
[SPEAKER_01]: full sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your process for hardening off
plants from going from indoors to
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially our best results that we saw,
and it's always, I'm going to back that
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the conditions and the
climates, but temporarily, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like putting from indoor to outdoor,
and then outdoor to indoor, it's better
[SPEAKER_00]: because then the plants get used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally we recommend to put outside in
the middle of the morning, till more or
[SPEAKER_00]: less the middle of the afternoon,
and then put it back in indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to take, especially because we
are, normally we are talking that this
[SPEAKER_00]: phase, it's in the beginning of the
springtime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the beginning of the springtime,
the sun is not too strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there is like some condition
that let you put the plants outside to get
[SPEAKER_00]: used a little bit and then put inside,
you know, so it's not too strong the sun
[SPEAKER_00]: to hide the temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a medium climate, you know,
like, and that's helped a lot the plant to
[SPEAKER_00]: get used.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can do that for 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the plants start to get used and you
see that, you know, Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the big concerns for folks
that are growing outdoors, and we kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about it a little bit earlier,
at least mentioned it, was pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're taking these plants from
indoors to outdoors, one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: you're exposing to is potentially a lot
more pests invading that area that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing in and that attacking that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: What tips do you have for preventing pests
or any major infestations have happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you go about battling these pests?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is a good question,
because in indoor, you can, as we spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: before, you know, like can control better,
you know, like with your filters from
[SPEAKER_00]: outside, you know, like you can,
you have always to be really clean where
[SPEAKER_00]: you work and your station, you know,
because pattern mites are there at the
[SPEAKER_00]: door, you know, so and also if you,
for example, if you work with clones and
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy clones, so you take those for
friends to be sure to sterilize them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, because otherwise you can
bring it inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside, mostly, you know, we always say
it's better safe than sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's better to work in advance,
you know, like, and first of all,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the companion planting, you know,
so what does it mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, plant, you know,
like put some different kinds of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: close to your plants that attract pests,
you know, like a spider mites or the white
[SPEAKER_00]: fly or the trips, you know, so first thing
that this, this, this incident to its coin
[SPEAKER_00]: on that plants, before your attack,
your, your medical plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's, that's a first nice preventer
is to mention some of them, like
[SPEAKER_00]: Coriandolo, it's really good that
something that, so in US you can find
[SPEAKER_00]: easily, it's like then the Marygold plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know that,
but it's Marygold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice for the white fly because
attract the white fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the salvia, the lemongrass also,
it's really good to attract, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, and that's already in this way,
you, you create like a kind of protection,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, around your plant.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then something that we also use quite a
lot and it's, it's, it's considered
[SPEAKER_00]: biological in the biological growing is
the neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The neem oil sprayed in the, in the,
in the, in the vegetative stage create a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit kind of a layer, you know,
on the leaf to protect them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's, it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much, like we recommend once every
two weeks as maximum, never in the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: time, but this is can, can, can,
can help also to prevent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, always talking about
organic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So biologically growing, it's the
predators that this, you have to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: predator in case it's like not the late,
the late move, but you don't need the
[SPEAKER_00]: predators if you don't have the problem
because the predators survive eating the
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites or, you know, like the fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you start seeing, you know,
like a development on this disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know, like a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can, you can use the predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a biological fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally it's like ladybugs that you can
find it in, in packs of 500, 1000,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and you start to spread this,
this, this bugs, you know, like around,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they start to, to, you know,
as a predator to eat the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, the, the, the spiders or the fly
or, or the trips in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the, this is the organic way,
let's say that the biological way to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to prevent that and, and, or,
or, or to fight with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you know, there is always
chemical solutions to that, but we never
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend that, you know, like it's for
normally these products is for use of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always try to push the people to,
to be as natural as possible, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now training plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get into that next to this is
something that can be drastically
[SPEAKER_01]: differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing indoors versus outdoors,
narrowing it down to outdoors in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular, what type of plant training do
you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the resident where you want to
get, because there are many different
[SPEAKER_00]: types of auto growers, you know,
there are auto growers that they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any problems on the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of the plants that they're going to grow
or others, because many of our customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the growers that grow our seats in the
cities inside the city centers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they use balconies or they use terrace to
grow outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, for, for, for, for a grower
that it's in the countryside or can grow
[SPEAKER_00]: big plants, topping and theming,
it's always recommended, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can boost drastically your,
your, your, your, your, your, your
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy, you know, like your, your harvest
quantity of flowers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: because topping and theming are really two
nice techniques to, to get more,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to, to boost and power the,
the, the beside the, beside the branches
[SPEAKER_00]: and then have way more top colors than,
than don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really, really recommend that to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the theming with a really nice
theming, you can get really many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many top colors, you know,
so that's, that's, that's really useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For who is growing, like in the,
in the, in the, in the, in the balcony,
[SPEAKER_00]: in places where you don't want to attract
attention from outside and show that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis in the balconies,
low stress training, LST is really good
[SPEAKER_00]: because you can train your plant and keep
it short, keep it low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So under the radar, let's say of the,
of the people, it's also a really good,
[SPEAKER_00]: a really good training, you know,
training technique to grow, to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scrub also, you know, in the balcony
and the LST, that's, that's not,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some outdoor growers, the only
training they'll do is they'll do,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a 45 degree bend of that main
stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the rest is just those side
branches come up and it just grows out to
[SPEAKER_01]: this one big ball.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that seems to be a common thing that
people do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the, and the, and the first part of
the plant, you really see the,
[SPEAKER_00]: when you, when you turn, when you turn at
40 degrees, you know, the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you really see like a node, you know,
like it say, wow, you know, this plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on that, I want to say that our
outdoor varieties are really, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable on that, you know, because you
can really try and test, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: different kind of, of, of techniques,
because you see that if they have good,
[SPEAKER_00]: good climate, you know, you see them that
are unstoppable, you know, you can,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can grab them and,
and turn, you know, like a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything, you know, like a 40,
50 degrees too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, they keep on, they, they keep on
growing, you know, they, they,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't stop, you know, like,
you know, that's the, that's, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice from the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They recover quite quickly from the,
from, you know, the, the techniques and
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from the cropping too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one question that I wanted to ask you a
little bit of controversy, I guess you
[SPEAKER_01]: could say it has to do with flowering time
and when you actually start counting
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an indoor grower and a lot of my
audience are indoor growers, they count
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering days in order to kind of get an
idea of when they need to harvest the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Different varieties have different
flowering times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically when they flip that light cycle
to either a 12, 12 light cycle or 11,
[SPEAKER_01]: 13, whatever flowering light cycle they're
flipping to, they'll start to count
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering days from there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now outdoors, when you're growing
outdoors, there is no grow light to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: on to initiate flowering, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It naturally happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: When do outdoor growers typically start to
count flowering days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that they look at the
plant and see flowers start to occur and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they start to count flowering days or
do they actually look and see sunlight?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much sunlight they're getting per day?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, as you, as you just mentioned,
like when also we try down the
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristic of a genetic, of a variety
or a new variety, we test indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor, greenhouse, we have different
testing spots, but normally we count the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower time from the indoor, the moment
that we turn 12, 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do, you know, also to put
the characteristic, you know, and do
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis on our varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: On outdoor that change a bit because the
time of reaction of the plants on the
[SPEAKER_00]: changing of the hours of lights depends on
the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have varieties that already like from,
like I mentioned one like Friesendew is an
[SPEAKER_00]: example or Durbopoison.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already with 14 hours and a half of
lights, they start flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are others like Destran that is
a pure Sativa, a cross between Treeland
[SPEAKER_00]: Races Sativas that start flowering in two
weeks from when the time is 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the time when, when, when it starts,
it's really because, and the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: already started flowering actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see the pieces, we don't see the
pre flowers, but the plants it's in pre
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really in the outdoor,
it's a little bit more difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally personally, I count that from
when the first hey, you know, a flower
[SPEAKER_00]: years, so the first pistils go,
you know, are visible on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I start counting from that,
you know, but it's approximately because
[SPEAKER_00]: depends a lot on the variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to ask that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got, there's quite a few folks that
will debate particularly as indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people don't actually start counting
the flowering days when they flip the
[SPEAKER_01]: light cycle, they wait till they start to
see the plant flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got the outdoor growers
chiming in that say, Hey, we don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: have a light cycle to change over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, you know, we just start calling
flowering days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once we see the plants, they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like there's an ongoing
debate, a lot of confusion on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on who counts it when and, and so on and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just want to throw that question at you
and see how you answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, because between the vegetative
stage and the flower time, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: short period where normally the plants
stretch a lot that it's between 10 days
[SPEAKER_00]: that is pre flowering, you know,
so you, we should talk about also pre
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering, you know, because it's not
really full flowering, but it's pre
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a middle point between the
vegetative stage and the plants and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants start get using to the change of,
of, of, of hours of lights, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they start changing the hormones also
and, and, and put them, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in the, in the, in the flower,
in the flower stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's a good debate,
but I think it's, it's a middle point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everybody can, can, can see a
different ways, you know, like in this
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indoor for us, it's when we turn 12,
12 for our point and outdoor you really
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on the, on the genetics and,
and the climate and, and where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: too, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So moving along here, the plant has been
flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just get up towards harvest here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are different varieties that
have flower for different lengths,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we talked about, but determining when
to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's, this is another thing
that some folks will have different
[SPEAKER_01]: methods on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some will look at the trichomes,
some will look at just the plant looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at the, the pistols or stigmas that are
there to make sure they change colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you typically look for to
determine when to harvest the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a good, um, that there are many
schools on that, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there is many different situations,
you know, first of all, in the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, you depend a lot on the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: So always look the weather, try to
understand, you know, like we'd say,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, my plants is full flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can keep her a couple of extra weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to get 10 days of rain.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like then we always recommend an
early harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better to harvest a bit earlier than
keep the plants for 10, 15 days or a full
[SPEAKER_00]: week of full rain or harvest under the
rain, because we tried everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like in Netherlands happen,
you know, like, uh, you know, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: days sometimes have three different
seasons from the morning to the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to get prepared on everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, like look the weather,
of course, you know, like you have to see
[SPEAKER_00]: the buds already, a structure ready,
you know, like I give it time to flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the weather, the weather changing,
it's, it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at the weather.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, you know, like depends
a little bit of the characteristics of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sativa, the hybrid, the indicus,
um, normally, you know, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: the first, the second step on the weather
is to look at the pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the color.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, there are, and then also depend on the
variety of genetics that become a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: percent on, on, on, on like orange,
uh, brown pistils, you know, like orange,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's famous to be like when you
harvest it, it's 90% like really orange
[SPEAKER_00]: pistils on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, or, you know, like, um, you get like
60, 70% on, on the, on the, on the color
[SPEAKER_00]: of the pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have to remember also that
when we cut it and when we harvest it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we lay, you know, we put it down,
down side.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a, in a black environment, you know,
in a dark environment, uh, the plant still
[SPEAKER_00]: for a few days have liquids inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So still to mature a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process doesn't, doesn't hand,
uh, in the, in the, in the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the moment that you cut the plants,
but it's still going a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't be scared, you know, to,
uh, to, to, to, to, to harvest a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit earlier than, than what you expect if
the weather is not great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third, the third option,
you know, the third wave, it's to check,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the strikers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are transparent or milky or
humble, uh, and on that depends also what
[SPEAKER_00]: you want to, to get as, as, as,
as an effect from your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you, if people look for
growers, look for Sativas dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: normally they look for a nephoric effect
of uplifting energetic effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then normally you get this effect with a
little bit of early harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I want to say like too
early, but early harvest get you a fresh,
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh flowers, you know, a little bit like
fresh, tasty, you know, like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't get so much terpenes that,
that you can get with a perfect or a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit later, uh, harvest,
but you're going to get a really
[SPEAKER_00]: uplifting, mainly of the time uplifting
and energetic effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're looking for a Sativa,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, uh, then you have also a late
harvest, you know, like a little bit late
[SPEAKER_00]: when maybe already like 40, 50% of your
tricots are already humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're looking for that because it's
like more about body stone, like more,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, couch, uh, you know, like couch
situation where, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: stalk, you know, like a more, more strong
effect on the, on the, on the body too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more relaxing, you know,
more, more powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, so it depends also what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's normally the effect that you're
looking for the Indica's dominant,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the, or the pure Indica's dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends also a little bit what,
what do you want to get on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, uh, regarding that,
uh, I want to mention that because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a science on that, but it's quite,
quite clear from, from the tests that we
[SPEAKER_00]: get and from the many feedbacks and
reports that we, we have, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that, uh, that's, that's,
that's, uh, a principal point on,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the effort too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people would say personal
preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some folks who, well, me in
particular, I like mostly cloudy trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: with a little sprinkle of amber.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some people like, Oh, I'm looking
for about 50% amber because I want more of
[SPEAKER_01]: a laid back coach lock effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, personal preference.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also glad you mentioned that the
weather has being an indicator on when to
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest, because that's something we
don't, us indoor growers, we don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: hear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even consider because we're
indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to worry about the weather,
but yeah, when you're outdoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to pay attention to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there's so many growers who have
lost harvests because they had rainy days
[SPEAKER_01]: towards the end and then they had bud rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if they had harvested a little bit
early, they could have avoided that bud
[SPEAKER_01]: rot from infiltrating their, their plants
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I'm really glad you brought up
weather as a, uh, an indication of when to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a principal point,
you know, like also because if you harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: under the rain, then you have to get your
products inside, uh, turn down the
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity to take off the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you don't gonna have really good
turps on that, on that, on that flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like, uh, you can still have
good products, but, um, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be top, top notch, you know, like a
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a lot more labor too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I want to get back into strains a
little bit, and I want to know your
[SPEAKER_01]: personal preference really.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you name off the top three strains
that you've grown outdoors that you really
[SPEAKER_01]: like?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, uh, it's a really fanatic outdoor
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the growing outside and
give me a lot of, uh, happiness at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of, uh, of, of every circle because it's
also, you know, follow the, the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the, the season time, you know,
so when, you know, when you're harvesting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get in September, October,
you know, Europe was always autumn,
[SPEAKER_00]: so more rainy, you know, like,
and you have the, the, your, your,
[SPEAKER_00]: your new flowers, you know, from the
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I mentioned, I started as Maria
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the, in the middle, of the boots,
you know, like putting nets to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: them from the animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like it was really like,
uh, not, not, not easy to, to get,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to, to harvest the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm really, I really love the
skywalker, large passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's an old school variety that is
a cross between blueberry and mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a monster plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called like that because the branch,
so the, the, the, the top buds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like are really like alpha meter
size, you know, like really huge yielding
[SPEAKER_00]: and super fruity, uh, sweet smell come
from blueberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like a nice combination
with a tough and strong effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a indica effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like a really couch locking for,
at least for me, for the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy more this kind of effect
when, when I relax myself, when I finish
[SPEAKER_00]: my day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, then I have the mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also one of the, my top three for
the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's fresh, fresh, uh, smell and,
and, and, uh, you know, like it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: minty fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a particular variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really strong to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like, uh, it can suffer a
lot, but you, you, you get something from
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, so it's always the rivery,
uh, the, the mazar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's also a really nice,
a really nice effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the third one is the freeze and you
that actually I like it and I still really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy that because it's, uh,
it's beautiful plants with a beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: color, a fresh, uh, tasty, you know,
like, uh, I incense, uh, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a fruity incense,
you know, like it's a good mixer of the
[SPEAKER_00]: old school, uh, Dutch, uh, you know,
like a coffee shop smell, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, the flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really enjoy also the effect because
it's a uplift in the effect, not too
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about around 12 and 16% of
THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put it in that medium low THC
average, you know, like, and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy for my daily smoke, you know,
like, uh, it's, it's enjoyable because I
[SPEAKER_00]: can be super functional with that,
you know, like, uh, motivate me,
[SPEAKER_00]: focus me when you have to do something
that maybe I don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, like, uh, if I'm too lazy at
the moment, you know, like, so it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a really like, um, uplifting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would put on the top three,
these three, and then I, many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many others, you know, to select only
three is difficult, but, uh, if I were to
[SPEAKER_00]: pick, uh, without either all blind,
I would pick, uh, these trees for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of those sound incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned outdoors, the folks that
are tuning in that grow indoors,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you recommend it to grow indoors as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you only say outdoors only for
those three?
[SPEAKER_00]: Skywalker and Mazar also indoor,
but Freezing Dew is not really for indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you can grow it indoor,
but you enjoy, you can enjoy better indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties growing indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's really a typical outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's really a good outdoor variety,
you know, like that you enjoy the maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: point that you enjoy is outdoor or
greenhouse glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, I would pick other, other
varieties.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Skywalker and Mazar, you can really
enjoy that also in indoor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually just got my hands on,
well recently got my hands on Skunk number
[SPEAKER_01]: one by Dutch Passion and I haven't grown
it out yet, but I got it through Seedsman.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you guys have a partnership with
Seedsman and, uh, yeah, got Skunk number
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super excited for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a iconic legendary stream
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you will see the size of the bud of,
of that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I say, wow, you know,
lately we see like real nice genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we said before, but also the size of
the bud is decreasing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like you have super frosty and
really nice colors and fantastic flavors
[SPEAKER_00]: and turns, but that old school stuff like
Skunk number one or the white widow,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you see the size of the bud and
say, wow, you know, like it's like a tin
[SPEAKER_00]: of Coca-Cola, you know, like it's really
like the old one had the fat one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say, wow, it's like, uh, it's really,
really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't wait to grow that one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, when I first started growing,
my buddy had Skunk number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I grew out one of his cuts and,
um, I'm curious to see if it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: similar to what I grew up back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I know there are a bunch of
different Skunk number ones, different
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders have their own version of it and
stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, yeah, really looking forward to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably get that, hopefully get that in
the ground this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking forward for your,
your feedback too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, uh, we hope you enjoy this
legendary variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are getting up towards the end of
the episode here and want to give you a
[SPEAKER_01]: chance to tell a little listeners how they
could find you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there anything upcoming in the
future that you have going on that you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we, yeah, we're working,
you know, like, uh, yeah, the genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, you know, like environment and the
industry it's, it's growing fast and we
[SPEAKER_00]: are studying, you know, like, and testing
a lot of new varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, uh, we breed and, and, and stabilized
one of the first variety, uh, with our eye
[SPEAKER_00]: contact with THC V it's called a THC
victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, it's really interesting medical for
medical users.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we are also testing and study,
uh, something really interesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: could be another chapter, you know,
like that is the triploid varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that it's still at the beginning of
the, of the, of the, of the development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but we see quite a lot of potential on
the, on the triploid, uh, genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, talking about terpenes and
quantity of, of, of cannabinoids and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and as, as a strong plant, you know,
like really stable, stable variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, we're working, we're working
really hard, you know, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, with our, our, our breeding team,
you know, here in Amsterdam and also with
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration around the world in
different countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, we really love what's happening
with the plants because it's becoming
[SPEAKER_00]: really like a huge international community
always been, but with the legalization and
[SPEAKER_00]: with the technology that is coming in,
uh, we are improving a lot of aspect of
[SPEAKER_00]: source of our, of our job, you know,
in general, we improve in the quantity,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also because big, you know,
like, uh, companies normally was always
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in agricultural industry,
the normal one, the corn and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they get interesting and they're
putting some technology, uh, to us,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, like to use, uh, on the plants,
uh, um, you know, testing and analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are discovering a lot of potential
on, on, on using these new technologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so yeah, you can, can stay tuned,
you know, like we have, uh, a web,
[SPEAKER_00]: a website dedicated also for, for USA,
you know, like, uh, where every,
[SPEAKER_00]: every week we share blogs, information for
any kind of level growers, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like from, from the beginners to like the
pro, you know, like the breeding process
[SPEAKER_00]: that we use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, you can, you can stay tuned on our
web website and in our, in our,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, channels, you know, like social
channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, uh, you know, we're going to be
in Spannabes this year in the,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the biggest expo of Europe in
Barcelona, the Mary Jane in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's real nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a connection of all the, you know,
like, like, like worldwide connections,
[SPEAKER_00]: Spannabes in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's always, we always have a really
amazing week altogether, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like it's amazing to share a lot of new
come, come, you know, on the desk,
[SPEAKER_00]: so on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really like, uh, it's motivating
too, you know, like, uh, we, we,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, we feel that we are in the right
direction, you know, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: keep on working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like, uh, uh, you know,
to offer the best genetics, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like that we can to, to the growers,
because of course, you know, it's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: mutual trust, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when a grower choose for your seed,
your genetics, not just, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a plant, you know, like a growing,
it's, it's, it's four months, five months.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, it's time investing,
money investing, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, so it's really important for us,
uh, keep the quality first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's what we always do, uh,
uh, and, and, and, and, and we are really
[SPEAKER_00]: happy because, you know, we have many,
many growers worldwide, like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: really happy and, and giving great
feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's for us, the best motivation and
the expo for us is opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, to get face to face with, with,
with that people, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and then combine the works and all
like a create collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, it's, uh, it's, it's amazing what
happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The networking can be so valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dutch passion Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have that linked in the description
section below.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the folks tuning in on this can easily
get to your social page there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also want to give a big thanks to the
folks that are supporting on Patreon,
[SPEAKER_01]: patreon.com slash Mr. Grow at a hundred
percent of what gets supported through
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon goes right back into the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep this podcast going.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: The folks being scrolled on the screen
right now on the producer tier,
[SPEAKER_01]: special thanks to you, Francisco,
once again, thank you so much for coming
[SPEAKER_01]: on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do enough talk about genetics on
this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I want to do more often.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hearing about not only outdoors,
which is something we don't talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: much, but outdoor genetics, I think it's
going to add a lot of value to the folks
[SPEAKER_01]: that are listening into.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks so much for your time today and
hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Chris, thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, we hope you, we hope to,
to see you really soon in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you, you are more than welcome
here in the Dutch patients family.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all my bucket list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be out there eventually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Catch you in the next episode.
