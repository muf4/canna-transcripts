[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_00]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_00]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?

[SPEAKER_00]: And we are back, and I'm joined with Jorge
Cervantes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful day here in the south of
Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, it is an honor to have you on the
podcast today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your Grower's Bible was the first book I
ever bought.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started growing back in 2010,
and I was, I think, a year into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up buying that book, and it was my
go-to guide for so many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a real prominent figure in the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just so excited to have you on
here today to talk about a variety of
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, before we get too deep into
those things, can you give us a little
[SPEAKER_00]: introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
kind of how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've always liked gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since I was a little kid, I liked
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the only one in my family that liked
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, little kids, they grow two crops
that all little kids grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Radishes, because they're so fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like those little little red ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what the heck do they call those?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember what they call them,
but they're really fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like 28 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one that all little
kids grow is corn, sweet corn,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's a C4 plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And C4 means it, well, most plants are C3,
which means they fix carbon, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But C4, that means they grow faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's one of those plants that
grows fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, it'll grow taller
than you as a little kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I started with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when cannabis came out,
I just got really interested in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I lived in Southern California and
started growing in the hills behind Santa
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara, a little town right next to it
called Montecito.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means little mountain in Spanish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since then, they've had like mudslides
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I started a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wrote this book here and nobody had
published it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody would even print it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to print the book myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did all my own artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty limited artwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had a few photos, but all the
photos were black and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's all I could afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: The book is 96 pages, sold for $8.95.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I printed the book myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: First year, this thing sold 6,000 copies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was back in 1983, just in the
Northwest, Washington and Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a little bit in Vancouver,
B.C., and a little bit in Northern
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, I've written like 50
books, at least 50 books.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're published in 11 different
languages, all the five common languages,
[SPEAKER_01]: European ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some other quotes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got this one I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a Japanese book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little hydroponic book I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's another one I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the English edition here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the one that you saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one I have, yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the one that finally did really
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the fifth edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, fifth edition from 2006.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one is the Russian edition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there are 11 different languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then this one, this book here,
this one, this is an encyclopedia.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely my biggest, best book
ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm giving this one away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give it away on my website.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also done tons of videos,
lots of videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the videos I did with the New
York magazine, High Times, and did a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I did one of them in
Vancouver, B.C., or Lower Mainland,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did another one in the Netherlands,
mainly in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I did another one in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of that was shot around where I
live in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the deal is, I got on the internet,
well, I got on YouTube early on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made it through, that's when it was
really expensive to produce videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there wasn't a lot of information
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the production values were,
well, much different than they are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened was, anyway, I got these
videos went all over the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I literally had millions and
millions of views of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I started making my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made about 300 videos, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do garden tours and yeah,
garden tours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And backyard stuff, I had like three or
four different garden beds that were full
[SPEAKER_01]: of different varieties of plants and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just go through and did that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I started about five decades ago,
like in the 80s, early 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was my public life.
[SPEAKER_01]: This book here came out in 1983.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, yeah, gosh,
I mean, it's been a heck of a long career.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been more than 40 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, well, 42 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: 42 years I've been at the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've traveled a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent a lot of time in Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I moved here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been here like officially,
like, yeah, about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over a third of my life has been here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spent a lot of time in, or a bit,
not tons, but a bit in Latin America,
[SPEAKER_01]: South America, Mexico, Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been in Australia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Haven't spent any time in Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was in Japan, like that one book of mine,
Japanese, where the heck ever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, I've done a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had to deal a lot with this
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, these two books are actually
pretty much the same book.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is about a specific plant and
the other one's about all kinds of
[SPEAKER_01]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this book sold very, very well for
many years until life changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the United States, let's put it that
way in the late 90s.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit of background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, I've been at this a long
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of people and probably more
people know me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to wear a disguise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I used to wear a disguise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's a little character of this
one of me in a disguise.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here where I wear dreadlocks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I guess there's, oh yeah, there's
another book here that I was in a
[SPEAKER_01]: disguise, but I just don't always.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, there's Russian books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's, here's the more disguises.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is me in the videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wore the disguise because, well,
back then times were definitely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what was the deal was there was no,
no internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could, I could go across borders and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I had to do was look differently and
it sure, sure helped a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helped a heck of a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it doesn't help at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just run my name either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any name I want to put out out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just run that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew who I am.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I've certainly seen a lot of
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen patterns happen, you know,
yeah, but lots of change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's probably the biggest thing that
I've seen is change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's way more information about
indoor cultivation now way more than there
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know a lot more about light and in
general, well, yeah, indoor lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have done so much good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Work over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned, yeah, it was 1983.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was your first book.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually two years before I was
born.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been at it for a very long time and
you've really paved the way for not just
[SPEAKER_00]: access of the information, but also for
other content creators to put themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your DVD is still on Amazon today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody could actually look that up
and watch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually watched it about a handful
of years ago and I just brought back some
[SPEAKER_01]: memories, you know, I mean, yeah,
yeah, you can probably find it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, high times is there,
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what you'd call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in receivership or whatever it is,
but that they're in big trouble with the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal trade commission and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know really who who's in charge
of, of the asset there that that'd be a
[SPEAKER_01]: property, you know, all of these,
they, they own the rights to these videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know what the story is there,
but you can probably find them on,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the internet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they wouldn't let me put them on my
site and that kind of pissed me off a bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I mean, I certainly made them a
lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can imagine how much, but yeah,
your content has definitely been exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: all over the world and so many people have
gotten value and learned how to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicinal plants because of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you don't, you're, you're still
going, which is really, really inspiring
[SPEAKER_00]: to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now on this podcast, I do have a variety
of viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got folks that are beginners,
some folks that are intermediate,
[SPEAKER_00]: probably a smaller amount of advanced
growers, but I feel like mostly it's
[SPEAKER_00]: beginners and intermediate growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to go into some questions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really this podcast is kind of to get
information about like hands-on stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the stuff, there's some of these
questions that I have, which I've given
[SPEAKER_00]: you in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really goes off of things that were
in your book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would kind of want to get a little bit
deeper into or clarification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first one I want to jump into has
to do with the 24 hour light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of folks are just giving when
they're growing indoors, they're just
[SPEAKER_00]: giving 24 hours of straight light and no
hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question for you is, is that optimal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do plants need a rest period at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they do actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can hype them up like that,
but what happens here's the deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's real similar to people or
animals like a horse.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you ride that horse too long.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's lathered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe he can keep going,
but he going to fall over dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, he's not going to work
too hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with the dog, same with the person,
you know, you can only take so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it gets too hot outside, you can't
handle it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your body's got to rest and recover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when the growth and everything
takes place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when you got, when you got,
uh, you, you push the heck out of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, uh, plants, people,
animals, uh, what happens is especially
[SPEAKER_01]: in, in plants, this, the cells aren't as
strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got weaker walls, you know,
it's just like not as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a little bit narrower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everything is just like,
not as strong, not as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, that happens that that's the first
thing it doesn't have time to catch up and
[SPEAKER_01]: grow and metabolize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause see, they, they've been growing
outside for like millions of years,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Millions of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're used to this regular schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anybody that's grown very much at all,
any kind of plants knows that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the last thing you want to do is
uproot that plant or change that plant
[SPEAKER_01]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it likes a regular schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah, it definitely, definitely
needs a downtime and you're not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make it grow any faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I, I talked to a lot of people,
like some guys who are mechanics that are
[SPEAKER_01]: into growing indoors and they liken
everything to an internal combustion
[SPEAKER_01]: engine and it's not the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't work the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you've got a lot more variables
here and you've got soft tissue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got water rather than, than oil,
you know, complete different values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it's, it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mainly the thing, especially new people,
you want to follow what mother nature's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing and it works, works every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or usually good to know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally go after the 18 six light
cycle for the veg stage to give some rest
[SPEAKER_00]: period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know a handful of folks that
strive for the 24 hours of, of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was just curious on, uh,
yeah, because there's a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_00]: say that it's perfectly fine and that
plants don't need a rest period.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others say they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm happy that you, uh,
revealed some stuff for us here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Science says that there's a lot of
chemistry that goes on.
[SPEAKER_01]: During that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that's in your
book, which I wanted to bring up was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about the sex of the plant and how
environmental factors can influence it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, it says something that
things like increased nitrogen for more
[SPEAKER_00]: females, lower potassium for females,
lower temps for male plants, lower
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity for male plants, more blue light
for female plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is all that stuff still accurate today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very much so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are for, and that's,
that's for regular plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically all you're doing is making,
um, uh, stacking the deck in favor of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of more female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you just, you make a nice
life for the plant and they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: make more female plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another, what, another diocese
plant, uh, holly, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's another diocese one, you know,
um, what's another one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiwis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kiwis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another one, you know,
those are perennials.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are testing facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually send out, take a sample
of it when it's a seedling and send it out
[SPEAKER_00]: for DNA sex testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wasn't aware that you could actually
get it tested and then they could say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: female, but if you're vegging it wrong,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're too low of temps, for example,
it could increase your chances of males.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just look at the list here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Longer days, 18 plus hours of light says
more males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a pretty surprising thing to
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I figure I just touch base and figure out
if that was still true or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really interesting because,
you know, with the sex, there's a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially lower animals and snails and
worms and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: They change sex back and forth,
you know, from a male to female,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they'll be both sexes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, and plants too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's like that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Higher, higher things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to have it sorted out a little
bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not always.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So another thing it says in your book,
it says that medicinal plants virtually
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped growing at 85 degrees Fahrenheit,
which is 25 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, is that just certain genetics or all
genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will CO2 supplementation allow the plant
to grow at those higher temps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, I'll tell you, you know, when,
when I wrote, when I wrote that,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was mainly talking about, well,
I was talking about the indoor indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with outdoor plants, you can push
those a lot, a lot more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on some stuff, I just was,
you know, either I didn't qualify stuff or
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just playing wrong, you know,
on stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you look at, you look at an outdoor
plant, one that's planted in the,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the earth, that was planted early on,
and it's got a real deep taproot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing, that, I mean, it can take a
lot of abuse, a heck of a lot of abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got a heck of a good water source
already, and it's getting it from very
[SPEAKER_01]: deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's got tons, lots of foliage on it
that it can also use to shade the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's got a like ton, like a real
good source of water, and it's got a good
[SPEAKER_01]: root system, it can, it can take way
higher temperatures than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as like the upper end, I couldn't
tell you for sure, because you mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties earlier, or strains earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes a huge difference because see,
there's plants, I know, I remember my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend, God, so many people are dead now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Felix is gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: A Swiss guy lived in Ticino in the south
part of Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he, he, he was growing what he called
Perpiana trichensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, from Ticino, Ticino, trichensis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, he named, he gave it a Latin name.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purple from Ticino.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could take a freeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could, it could handle a freeze,
and it could take a freeze down to about
[SPEAKER_01]: like 20, 25, 26 degrees Fahrenheit for a
couple of nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go past three nights, and it would
have trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's, that's definitely a genetic
characteristic, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's big, and the same, same for heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you look at, if you look at
leaves, it's so simple, it's real
[SPEAKER_01]: physical.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the leaves, the indica leaves,
you know, where they grow on their cooler
[SPEAKER_01]: in the mountains, they're wide,
they're broad, broad leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that way they need that to gather
more sunlight, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you look at the plants that get,
that get really, really high sun in the
[SPEAKER_01]: tropics, they have a narrow leaf,
narrow leaf, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's so it'll dissipate heat
fast, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's all a function, so they,
they, they acclimate to all of these,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just gotta really learn a hell of a
lot more than we know of, about this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: and other plants, too, as far as their
specific tolerances go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times people try to get you
to say, well, I want a general statement
[SPEAKER_01]: that's true for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, it's like saying, I will cure
cancer, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which cancer will you cure?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many types of cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't just say, I'm gonna make a,
or you can't just make a general statement
[SPEAKER_01]: because we really just don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many variables when it comes
to growing these plants and science hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: uncovered everything when it comes to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, I think one of the things that
makes it so exciting to be in this space
[SPEAKER_00]: is that more and more things are being
uncovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like almost every day,
every week, there's some new information
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's studies being done on different
aspects of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just really makes things more
exciting and fun to grow these plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I stay with this, well, life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm like 71 years old,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm an old guy now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just don't know anything different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kept me entertained all this
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's going to be a lot of
other people like this too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's certainly kept you entertained.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about clones next,
particularly taking clones, what part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant to take it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of folks that say the top
of the plant's the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some say, well, the middle of the plant is
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others say the bottom part of the plant is
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best part of the plant to take
clones from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first, when I wrote that,
did that research there, what was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It said they wanted a lot of cellulose,
stiff cellulose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I read that several times.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I remember I was over in Austria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did a video, actually a bunch of
videos over there at Blowery Field to see
[SPEAKER_01]: over there, they can grow, they can grow
clones and sell them, but they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, my, my buddy Alex broke
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has flowery fields.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's a lawyer and he figured the law
out and he's figured it out about 15 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been making like literally
hundreds and thousands of clones every
[SPEAKER_01]: year since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's been very, very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those guys, they had some basic rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was you have as many budding
sites as possible or as many branches as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were taking all the clones off
the top of the plants where, where they
[SPEAKER_01]: basically have a high concentration of,
of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just exactly against everything
that I read that I, that I thought I
[SPEAKER_01]: believed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen so many people do it since
then.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really doesn't matter where you take
the clones from.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as the plant's healthy and growing
and healthy, I got to qualify that because
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of times they can have, what do you
call that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Powdery mildew inside and you can't tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could have some kind of a systemic
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's incredibly important to
keep your plants clean and keep them,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing, cause see,
Alex really impressed me a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't keep his plants, his mother
plants for more than six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he says six months is about the,
the end of a productive life for the
[SPEAKER_01]: females.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do real well during that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also, he also grows them in what
do you call those?
[SPEAKER_01]: The containers that are self pruning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Air, air, air pruning containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Root pruning containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keeps them growing fast, cranked up
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, it doesn't bother me to
admit I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, if somebody got better
information, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally take clones from,
taken from all parts of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a problem with rooting,
so I'm glad that you, uh, that you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, um, usually for,
well, for, for clones, uh, the,
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the big tricks for, for taking
clones is you have that, uh, have that
[SPEAKER_01]: soil or your substrate, just a few degrees
warmer than the, than the, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the air temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that'll usually stick your,
your roots a little faster than that in
[SPEAKER_01]: the air, but there's lots of information
on that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: As next question I have is also from your
book.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to shock a lot of
folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the common things that folks do is
they'll do some sort of defoliation of
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning of leaves prior to flipping to the
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in your book, as mentioned,
avoid pruning up to a month before
[SPEAKER_00]: inducing flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since pruning diffuses floral hormones,
flowering is slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: If heavy pruned before flowering,
peak maturation is delayed for a week or
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it takes a month or longer for
hormones to build up to pre-pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was super, super
interesting because this, people go
[SPEAKER_00]: against this quite often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, first of all, is this still true to
today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'll tell you, I've just,
there was one study, one study that I,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I read, uh, that, that promoted,
uh, pruning indoor plants that were grown
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, it proved that they got like,
I don't know, 10, 12% more harvest,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't, I, I, I went to look up to
study before I, uh, the program before the
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast and I couldn't find it,
but that's the only study that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: find.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the other information that
I've gotten has been, um, uh, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: hearsay information or anecdotal
information, no, side by side,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, study that's, that's really firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, that's why I said that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for outdoor plants, definitely
don't prune them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't see any, any benefit
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially, gosh, well, if you look at
this, as far as pruning goes, or well,
[SPEAKER_01]: pruning, uh, removing the shade leaves,
because that's what it is, pruning,
[SPEAKER_01]: trimming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they have different meanings,
but removing the shade leaves,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is, is specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, those guys, uh, I think a lot of
people have a small garden and they get
[SPEAKER_01]: antsy and they just want to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take off the leaf, you know,
and then I also see a lot of people do
[SPEAKER_01]: this, uh, lollipopping, they call it,
where they take up all the leaves off the,
[SPEAKER_01]: or all the leaves off the bottom of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's crazy because you
already paid for all of that light to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to go and cut those
branches off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make much sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you've got some really weak
growths down there, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cut that branch off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But taking it off as a matter of fact,
now I'd be growing all the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the way down to the bottom,
you know, the bottom of the, the ground,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it just, it makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, it's, it's just a waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to say the lights been spent,
the fertilizer has been spent,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything's been spent, but mainly it's
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got like three weeks of time
that you're not getting any benefit from.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've done anything, you've wasted
that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I, I, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I just can't, I can't find any
good information.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, and, and I'm hoping that people here
will, will put these studies down because
[SPEAKER_01]: normally what happens is people go,
well, I do it and it works for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, well, so what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't tell me anything, uh,
other than it works for you, but you
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't qualified anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you gotta, you gotta make, uh,
an actual study on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still have so much anecdotal gross science
that's floating around.
[SPEAKER_00]: People say, Hey, it works for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or what kind of variety was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what was the temperatures and
everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that's really important,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it comes to the lollipop,
I know one of the main reasons why folks
[SPEAKER_00]: do it is they claim that that lower,
that lower area of buds form there,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's more of like an area or structure and
removing that will help keep the,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, the top buds focused energy on the top
buds kind of forming and it helps with
[SPEAKER_00]: density and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I know it's cultivar dependent and
stuff like that, but I think I'd give you
[SPEAKER_00]: a heads up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd give you a heads up on why some people
are doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as far as defoliation,
one of the main reasons why folks like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it is to avoid, like if you have real
thick canopy, powdery mildew, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's like real thick lack of
airflow in there, that's one of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons just to prevent a powdery mildew
from forming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So forget, throw that one out there in
case anybody listening wasn't aware.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the way to solve those problems is
with the genetic superiority because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also with the type of cultivar
you're growing, you know, you,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't, you don't have such a tight,
tight, compact flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, cause those, those will make the,
the, the powdery mildew or they'll make
[SPEAKER_01]: the botrytis or they'll, they'll make a
home for, for insects and mites,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we, we've got tons of,
tons of, uh, work to do as far as,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as breeding goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause, you know, I mean, another one,
as far as breeding goes is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: branches aren't strong enough,
for example, to hold the flowers up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers will pull the branches over
or, or, uh, uh, some, some, some plants or
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of plants don't have a big enough
root system, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, um, yeah, or the, you know,
disease and pest resistant resistance is
[SPEAKER_01]: super important as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far, and, and also, uh,
being, being immune to like, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: heat and cold problems, you know,
huge, huge, huge deals, huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the things that kind of
relates to this a little bit was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about inducing flowering in particular,
waiting until preflowers have appeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've heard that you really should wait
to induce flowering or switch to that
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait until the preflowers have appeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said that such stress, you know,
if you go against that could cause a
[SPEAKER_00]: strange growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants may grow into hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So showing intersex traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a hundred percent, a hundred
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you know, like I say, the plants
don't change that fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and when they've been growing,
the same way for, for millions of years,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not going to deviate from that
very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so they're going to,
they're going to stay growing that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and two, like I mentioned before,
the cell walls get more, uh, thinner,
[SPEAKER_01]: narrower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're not as strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's all kinds of stuff that
produce produces stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, any kind of, and that'd be
photo period stress because you'd like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've got the ability to make the,
the, uh, the plant flower, the induced
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering, uh, really quickly by,
you know, giving it longer nights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd be stressing the plant out and
stress that they don't like stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, let's say, you know,
pretty much everybody's grown like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, radishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mentioned radishes earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But radishes, as soon as it gets hot,
or as soon as they're stressed out at all,
[SPEAKER_01]: they always bolt.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go to seed every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like I say, most people
have grown radishes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens anytime a plant gets
stressed, they want it, they try to
[SPEAKER_01]: complete their life cycle and produce a
viable seed in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the first thing they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anytime you stress out a plant,
any kind of a plant, they're going to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to complete their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to want to make seeds
and want to make it and try to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: planted in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll be healthy next year's and
they'll procreate for another year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just so straightforward and
simple, you know, and people, people that
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't really experienced with gardening
think they can go in and change all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the system's already been set up
before you got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another thing I've heard talking
about the amount of light given to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, really darkness.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that when you flip the flower,
it's really the darkness period that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have the plant to produce
fluorogen of the flowering hormone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does giving the plant less than 12 hours
of light induce any flowering faster?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it reduce yield?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it reduces yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, because there's that thing that daily
light integral.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have so many hours of light of
a specific spectrum and intensity every 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours for it to receive all the light it
needs to flower properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it doesn't get that, so if you've
got, if you've got say, well, 10 hours,
[SPEAKER_01]: say it's 10 hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to stuff 10 hours or 12
hours of light into that 10 hour,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so it's got, you just got to give it
more intense light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And technically that's, that's quite
difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's number one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's see, less light,
less light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get as much light.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not as bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your DLI goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, you definitely can get less,
less production, guaranteed, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other part is we don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that it goes all the way
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Dola Vanica is what we use here in
Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the whole spectrum or fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, you have the whole fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have a plant over here that,
that is auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers after like three weeks,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so that's one side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can have a plant over on the
other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: This says one of those really long season
sativa that really doesn't ever quit
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: It continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got this entire spectrum from
one side to the other complete,
[SPEAKER_01]: complete, complete, um, well, you know,
spectrum maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum of difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's, they're, they're completely
different at opposite ends of the,
[SPEAKER_01]: of the scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe that in between here is
you've got everything else too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this one here, you can get 24
hours of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this one here, you can have like 10
hours of light or, uh, and longer,
[SPEAKER_01]: longer photo period or longer light
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: A longer night, but everything in between
is the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that you're going to get plants
that flower with 12 hours of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: with 14 hours of light, with 10 hours of
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know which ones because we don't
know enough yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we usually, and, and, and usually with
these plants, since it's an outbreeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't know, we don't know what's,
um,
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't know if it's stable or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, it's got to be stable and then you
can measure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's so much unstable stuff out
there that we're not really doing
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves a service of making more
varieties that aren't stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of, we go around in circles
and it's going to take some big
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural company to sort that stuff
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sticking on the topic of light,
UV light, want to get into that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about UV light and how
it impacts trichome development?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the, the UV, the, what the example,
the best example I have, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: information, there's probably better
information than this, but in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: see you, you used to be able to grow any
plant you wanted in Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, about 20 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a friend of mine was growing these
plants at 900 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he also had another garden at 300
meters in elevation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So 300 meters, about a thousand and 900
meters, about 3000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was quite, quite a bit of difference
for 4,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what happened is the ones that,
uh, 900 meters, those plants had really
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy trichomes on it because they get
more UV light and they will put,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, uh, then the trichomes are there,
or these, the capitate stock trichomes are
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones we care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, trichomes just means plant here,
you know, so it could be any kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's within that classification,
there's four basic, well, there's quite a
few.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's quite a few different types,
but anyway, uh, with more UV light,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's, they make more trichomes to cover
up, cover up the foliage and protect it
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it doesn't necessarily make more
potent trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just makes more of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as far as increased impotency,
no, I didn't see that, but the number of
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now here's the, this is also real
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the garden down below at 300 meters,
uh, it was the same potency, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: approximately as the one up above in
relation to weight because, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, well, let's see in relation to weight,
what do I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you took one plant and that would,
that would weigh, uh, say a hundred grams,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then at 300 meters, and then you take
another plant at 900 meters and that would
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh 80 grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they still have the same potency,
the same level of, of stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty straightforward answer there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard pretty much the same stuff over
the course of the past several years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, that's what I found so far
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we all agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get into something a little bit
more controversial next, the flushing
[SPEAKER_00]: plants or soil prior to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should growers flush their plants or soil
prior to harvest?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, what are the benefits?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the number one is the term because
what they would actually be doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not flushing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're actually leaching the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leaching the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flushing is a different term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and usually people use that term
flushing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made this mistake until I was corrected.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so, um, now it doesn't make any
difference whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant, you can grow right,
uh, fertilize right up to the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: What, what the deal is, see, now this is,
this is where my perspective comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the good part about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: About being an old guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause see, when this industry grew,
the, the real money, there was,
[SPEAKER_01]: there was real money in fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where the money was at because
people needed it over and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they could keep buying it over
and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as we all know, most of what you
find in fertilizer is water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they take a little bit and,
and to make, to make a dollar,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we'll say if we use a dollar,
for example, make a dollar's worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that you would buy retail,
it costs you about two to three pennies to
[SPEAKER_01]: make that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a really big, a big margin
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why everybody seemed to be an
expert in fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that's where the only place
they make any money at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that you couldn't make any money at
lights because they were made by big
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, or the other stuff,
you could buy all of that stuff at the
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fertilizers, if you had your
special fertilizer, well, then you could,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, grow the best plants, the biggest
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody was a, uh, an expert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now you go into a nursery,
for example, any plant, just any kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant nursery, you know, and, um,
you look and see, you go to the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: section and you see there'd be about like
20, maybe 30 different fertilizer for two,
[SPEAKER_01]: 300, maybe 500 different types of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got 20 kinds of fertilizers for 500
different kinds of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you've got this plant, the one that
we've been dealing with this, this plant
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do we have?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, we have one plant and like 500
kind of fertilizers for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's call it money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money is the thing that's made the big
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they've done is, and then they,
they, they make that, uh, the hydroponic
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers, they make all kinds of
different mixes with them and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's just to take people's money
out of their pocket because I,
[SPEAKER_01]: I never used all that stuff and it's
worked fine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's what I'd be thinking out
about more than anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have any good statistics here,
but you know, I used to be, I was a garden
[SPEAKER_01]: writer in America, you know, like a
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, garden writers of America,
we had an association, a national
[SPEAKER_01]: association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, one of the things that they,
that we learned there was, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: see people put home gardeners,
home gardeners put about 10 times more
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer and chemicals on their gardens
than they need to, you know, and the same
[SPEAKER_01]: goes with indoor growers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, they, they put a lot more stuff on
there than they need to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a real good living and stuff,
but you, a lot of that stuff, you just
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need, you don't need, uh,
you know, uh, they got you loaded.
[SPEAKER_01]: So heavily on, on all the fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I wonder, I mean, you know,
it's not a real, I'm not going to be real
[SPEAKER_01]: popular with the, with the few people in
the industry, but man, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: all those fertilizer guys made tons of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I mean, serious money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never, I mean, some guys had like seven
different products you'd put in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, got a little pot here and you
got seven different products you put in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't, I don't understand
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you know, and then the farmers,
I mean, you just need a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: fritted trace elements, you know,
the fritted trace elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that as it means like
cloth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, it hooks, it hooks onto the,
the other elements and it stays with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, so it's immediately available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, uh, that and then your primary
nutrients and that's, that's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, secondary ones and they mix sulfur
with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just like hooked onto sulfur
molecules, hooked onto everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: it seems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't need any sulfur because it's
already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anything, I mean, I would,
for people, I would suggest that they get
[SPEAKER_01]: a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to do something, get a soil test.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best thing to do because then
you find out what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, and also with the organic
stuff, people carry that over,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, go overboard on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I certainly did in the first few
years when I was organic gardening,
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening organically, I had, uh,
I had, I don't know, maybe 10% organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, five is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, but it causes more trouble than
it's worth.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but yeah, I mean, you go to a
soil scientists and they will always call
[SPEAKER_01]: it mineral soil because it's mainly
minerals, you know, those guys are really
[SPEAKER_01]: well educated and I'd listen to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be super helpful to get that soil
test and even talk into an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I talked to a Bryant Mason,
the soil doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if you know who he is or not,
but he's excellent, very knowledgeable and
[SPEAKER_00]: he does consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a crop advisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he can take your soil test and then
kind of give you information on what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to add into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a great way to go about
it for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I do think you can overdo it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you had mentioned, like you had done,
I've overdone it as well when it comes to
[SPEAKER_00]: the organic side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a misconception out there
is people say that, Oh, if you're growing
[SPEAKER_00]: with organic inputs, all natural inputs,
the plant's just going to uptake what it
[SPEAKER_00]: wants, when it wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no harm in putting too much,
which is, which we know now is,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, is definitely not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, no, not at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they can, you can, you can,
uh, all like hot manures, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's all kinds of stuff you can burn
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you look at that and it's expensive
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the, the bat guano, that's
really expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know how hard it is to
chase those little bats around and have
[SPEAKER_01]: them poop in a bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tough job, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those guys should get paid a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to shift over to drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get your input on,
what do you feel is the optimal drying
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions and drying time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, there's all these different variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, first off, it depends on how the
plants harvested, how big the plant is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have, do you have the main stem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the main stem there or is there going
to be smaller stems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, so say for example,
if you harvest, harvest a plant and,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, you cut all the flowers off of the
stems and then the leaves off the,
[SPEAKER_01]: off of the flowers, uh, then you've just
got flower buds there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, those can be put in, uh,
on one of those, uh, little like drying
[SPEAKER_01]: screens or something, you know,
they have those expandable net,
[SPEAKER_01]: net shells.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that open up and you've got,
uh, usually it's two or three feet across.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had, I had one that was four
feet across.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really big.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would hold a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, yeah, you can, you can dry them a
lot faster in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, then, then with a big plant,
a big, uh, plant where you hold the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and keep the stems because see,
there's there's different, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: different levels of moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, you've got a stem this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's going to hold more moisture
than a stem this big.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's, there's just different
sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this has more moisture than this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the leaf that's real narrow or
real thin, uh, will, will dissipate much
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea is to equalize everything
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you want to get it, you want to get
out all of those, all the pigments and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff in, um, there's tons of,
tons of stuff in there that makes it taste
[SPEAKER_01]: green or, or ammonia like, um,
but the drawing, the drawing volatizes all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that, or just basically it dissipates
into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so you can get rid of, rid of all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends on what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can either keep the leaves on or keep,
or take the leaves off right at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's supple, usually smaller growers
will do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then big growers usually wait and
they'll try the whole branches,
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole plant first, or parts of the
plant, and then remove the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be more efficient that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then I'll tell you, I just got
the, these, um, I just got these things
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from, uh, Seisman and there's
apparently, uh, turplock.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called turplock.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but it's, uh, 58 to 62% humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ones I've seen have been,
well, they go from 55 to 60, 65,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it depends.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, this is approximately how much
humidity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, the way I do, or, or that you want
your plant to have, what I do is I did,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, um, I, I measured it, uh, what the
flower weighs when it's wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it's, when it's dissipated
three quarters of its, of its moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: that'll be, uh, well, say if it weighs,
uh, 10, 10 grams when it's dry or when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's wet, it would weigh, uh, two grams
and a half when it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would put it at approximately 70%
moisture, 60% moisture in that range.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that, then you're going to have to,
to check yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: My rule of thumb, the one that came up
with years ago was like, when you snap the
[SPEAKER_01]: stem, if the stem actually snaps,
then it's dry or if it's dry enough,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know, if it's dry enough to burn,
um, but I'll tell you if you can measure
[SPEAKER_01]: the, uh, the, uh, humidity or well,
the moisture within the, within the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect, um, to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can, if you can measure that,
you're, you're best off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then you come down to the curing
and the curing, I'm kind of like rambling
[SPEAKER_01]: on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the curing, what you do is,
uh, you want to even out the moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: because you had the, the real thin leaf
and then the thick stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll hold different moisture at
different rates where you want to back
[SPEAKER_01]: balance that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, what curing will do is it,
it evens those things, those two moistures
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hope that was a tough answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of found myself rambling a little.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your insight on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have reached the hour mark here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and is there anything upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future that you want to talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a lot of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you can go to,
[SPEAKER_01]: JORGE-Cervantes.com.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see this mug right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can look up all kinds of history
about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's lots of garden information,
tons of garden information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can go to that site and you
can also pick up this book here for free
[SPEAKER_01]: in 11 different languages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like 600 pages, you know,
A4 format in Europe or eight and a half by
[SPEAKER_01]: 11 inches in the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then let's see next month,
right out of month from now is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: Spanibus and Spanibus in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been talking to people and making
all kinds of plans and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but that's, that's a real big fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be the biggest one in the
world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but now Las Vegas is bigger,
the Las Vegas fair and all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the German fair,
uh, uh, Mary Jane, which is in Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in June, in middle of June.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but that, that fair is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was, it was way bigger than the fair we
have here in Barcelona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also I'll be going to,
uh, haven't, haven't decided for sure,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I probably will go up there to,
uh, Amsterdam to a green tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is really a good fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the biggest, um, horticultural
fair in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have our own section there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People like us, we have our own section,
you know, and before they used to kick us
[SPEAKER_01]: out all the time, but now we can hold our
heads up high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very happy about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of exciting stuff upcoming there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have a link to Jorge's
YouTube channel down in the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below so you can
easily access his channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge, thanks so much for coming on this
podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of good insight here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really an honor to have you on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, I picked up your book
almost 15 years ago now, and I've learned
[SPEAKER_00]: so much from you over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to thank you for all your
contributions over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to seeing what you have
coming out in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And before I end this, I want to give a
thank you to the folks that support on
[SPEAKER_00]: Patreon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks being scrolled on the screen
right now are in the producer tier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Special thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are one of the ones that keep this
podcast going.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jorge, we will leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again for coming onto the podcast
and hope you enjoy the rest of your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, um, late in the day now,
so I'm happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good night, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll catch you in the next episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
