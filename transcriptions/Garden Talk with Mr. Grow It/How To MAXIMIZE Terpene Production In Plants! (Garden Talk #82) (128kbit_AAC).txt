[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get open up that bag and it's
loud those are the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are volatile organic compounds and
that is actually what plants use to
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the plant's language.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead and spread that in your garden
and you're gonna see a huge increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial diversity which will then in
turn increase your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria are gonna come up and they're
gonna feed off of that nitrogen source and
[SPEAKER_01]: once the green is gone it becomes brown
and that's carbon and then the carbon
[SPEAKER_01]: feeds the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full circle of life there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why you should be growing in
living soil as organically as possible if
[SPEAKER_01]: not for the planet for increased terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody if you that don't know
me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're tuned into the Garden Talk podcast
this episode number 82.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode I interview Queen of the
Sungrown.

episode number 30 and she talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: several different things in that episode
such as building up your native soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: IPM, composting, and a few other topics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now she's back for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode she talks about terpenes
and tips on maximizing terpenes while

[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with a familiar face,
Queen of the Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for asking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're back for another episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So happy to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last episode that we did together was
highly liked and you revealed a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: good information for the audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely have the first episode
linked down in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below and also have it at the outro card
of this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you finish watching this episode,
you can click on the previous episode we
[SPEAKER_00]: did together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that was a really, really good
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to think if I DM'd you this or
not, but you inspired me to start
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if you remember that
conversation we had because I think I
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned I don't compost and I'll never
forget this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a flip of a switch for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were like, you don't compost and you
weren't angry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like a disappointment and it
really hit me like, oh, I need to start
[SPEAKER_00]: composting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I made myself a vermicompost bin and
I've been composting for almost a year
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what I'm trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Change people's perception and save the
planet one compost pile at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we have a whole bunch of good
topics to dive into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you introduce yourself for
those that didn't catch the first episode
[SPEAKER_00]: we did together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Alexandria Irons, AKA Queen of the Sun
Grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Instagram, YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a website, Queen of the Sun Grown
dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we spoke last, I was still
commercially cultivating medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this time, I've kind of changed
gears and completely I'm focusing on
[SPEAKER_01]: education, consulting and traveling the
country, helping people grow cleaner
[SPEAKER_01]: quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some super exciting stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really, really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to dive into today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you want to talk all about
terpenes, which is a topic that we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: covered too much on this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really interested to hear what you
have to say about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just dive into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to reveal to us today
about terpenes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so basically as a cultivator,
I see the big paradigm of indoor versus
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we talk a lot about the influence of
THC content versus terpene and the
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage effect and all of these
different things come into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I've really been pushing
this living sustainable, living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable gardening, organic methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why you should be growing
in living soil as organically as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: if not for the planet, for increased
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are responsible for the flavor,
the smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are what we would describe as loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you get open up that bag and it's
loud, those are the terpenes and those are
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is actually what plants use to
communicate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the plant's language.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can see increased terpene
synthesis from plants by increasing
[SPEAKER_01]: biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biodiversity is basically, you know,
the diversity of biology that is present
[SPEAKER_01]: when a plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so terpenes can change the physiology
of a plant as well as the plants around
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by increasing your biodiversity,
you're influencing the amount of terpenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that can be created by a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to get it in something more simple
that we can just like relate to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lavender, for instance, is super high in
the terpene linalool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And linalool is one of those terpenes that
is a plant to plant communicator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you plant lavender around other
plants, they will increase their linalool
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Strawberries do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, certain terpenes, though,
communicate directly with microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those is limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can have fungal mycelial
network, those mycorrhizae fungus that are
[SPEAKER_01]: down there in the root zone,
mutualistically helping the plant already
[SPEAKER_01]: with phosphorus uptake and all these other
cool things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it will help produce limonene if it
knows that aphids are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because increased in limonene will ward
off aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you've ever grown any plants that
are super high in that limonene,
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew some lemon meringue last year and
it was one of the only outdoor plants that
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't hit with aphids because aphids do
not like limonene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just amazing that all of these
different terpenes, while they are the
[SPEAKER_01]: communication tool of plants, they're also
helping us.
[SPEAKER_01]: These terpenes are studied and medicine
known for reducing breast cancer cells,
[SPEAKER_01]: helping alleviate nausea from chemotherapy
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: All different kinds of things happen
because of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think it's just so cool and
what an opportunity we have to explore
[SPEAKER_01]: them more and talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know any other person who's as
interested in terpenes as I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I mean, a lot of people,
the medicinal plant that we know and love,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people grow it for the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is super interesting that the
microbes in the medium have an impact on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think it's just the
nutrients that you feed the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: giving it the nutrition required and the
environment is going to adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotypical expression of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to actually help with the
terpenes as far as development and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what exactly, is there a specific
consortium of microbes that will trigger
[SPEAKER_00]: certain terpenes to be developed or how
does that work?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can the grower control that or do
they not have control of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so this is the crazy thing is that
terpenes are influenced by stress a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: the times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So growing outside introduces a lot more
diversity and stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are outside, you have heat and
cold and overwatering or underwatering or
[SPEAKER_01]: wind or more pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things increase terpene
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a little bit more about like,
you know, losing control, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: and allowing nature to run its course.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times we try to manipulate and
control all of these aspects in our
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And allowing nature to do its thing and
know that plants can handle high
[SPEAKER_01]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plants can handle a lot of different
stresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, you're going to see an
increase in these terpene productions if
[SPEAKER_01]: you kind of just take a step back and
relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do want to increase your terpene
production and take an active role,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would suggest increasing your
biodiversity and all aspects of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be things like cover
cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And companion planting because terpenes
are influenced by root exudates,
[SPEAKER_01]: which give off sugars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you think about
photosynthesis and what is the byproduct
[SPEAKER_01]: that is sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sugar is exudated through the
roots, calling in different
[SPEAKER_01]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those root exudates are different
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have different plants
there, you have different terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you have different microorganisms and
then you have an increase in production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so really, I would suggest having a
diversity in your inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of using synthetic nutrients,
using organic from a wide variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: sources, compost being one of the best
diversity of nutrients you can get because
[SPEAKER_01]: think about all of those different inputs
that are made, you know, that make up
[SPEAKER_01]: compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you want diversity,
you are what you eat and you want
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in terpenes, then you want
diversity in inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to have as much of that variety
there so that you can increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most terpenes all start out with
the same precursor and then they are
[SPEAKER_01]: synthesized into individual and unique
terpenes according to what kind of food or
[SPEAKER_01]: stress or microorganisms are present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really trying to increase that
diversity through your nutrient inputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: through cover crop and companion planting,
as well as increasing your microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, I've been teaching these
classes, like going hardcore, teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: living soil master classes across the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been to Tampa, Florida last weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Chicago the month before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Oklahoma City the month before
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in every class, I ask people to bring
soil samples so we can look at their
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes under a microscope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And predominantly, the samples that have
the highest diversity in microorganisms
[SPEAKER_01]: are those that have living native soil,
soil from outside in their groves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to get diversity,
go outside somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an established ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think old growth forest somewhere that
hasn't seen man destroy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grab a scoop of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put that in an aerated compost soil tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't aerate too long because you want
diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And go ahead and spread that in your
garden and you're going to see a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in microbial diversity,
which will then in turn increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you said about cover crops,
we'll back up here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you said about cover crops is pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its impact on terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we get deeper into cover crops a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I myself have only used clover and
very popular cover crop to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hit on diversity of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else can be used for cover crops that
will be beneficial to have it growing with
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is where holistic management
comes into play and holistically managing
[SPEAKER_01]: your garden, depending on what you need
and what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to ask yourself, what are your
resources?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much space do you have available?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you have to put into
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all of those answers are going to
influence what I would suggest for cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cover crops like buckwheat,
which I use a lot outside, grow really
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can harvest and cut it down four
times in a season.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have the time or want to put
in the effort of cutting back your cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop constantly, then maybe you want
something that's like a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: easy to manage, low growing, maybe like a
creeping time, which if you look at like
[SPEAKER_01]: mammoth peas, canna, troll, like a lot of
these pest controls are thyme oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think about look at what's in your IPM
regimen and all of these bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's peppermint, thyme,
citronella, oregano, stuff like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are great things to use as a cover
crop because it's going to be a pest
[SPEAKER_01]: deterrent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you like to cook, maybe you want
to incorporate some plants that you would
[SPEAKER_01]: cook with.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no right or wrong answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just depending on your certain
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you, what's your garden like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you want to incorporate in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I want to retain water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cover crops are known for water retention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very dry climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the top of the medium dries out super
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I'm growing with organic
amendments, for example, when I'm top
[SPEAKER_00]: dressing in worm castings or compost or
whatever, that top layer is drying out in
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbes are going dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having a cover crop in there is
beneficial for me for water retention
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also know that clover in particular is
good for nitrogen fixation, although I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing some mixed information in regards
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, yeah, it's great for
nitrogen fixation, takes nitrogen from the
[SPEAKER_00]: air, puts into the form that the plank can
uptake down in the medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say that bacteria needs to
actually do that transformation there,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some people say that takes a long
time for that process to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually complete your entire
grow of your medicinal plant and you
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had any benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any truth to that or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: So clover is a legume in the legume family
and it's all legume species, beans,
[SPEAKER_01]: peas, clover that have this ability to fix
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you said, from the atmosphere,
but they do rely on a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with rhizobia, a bacteria
that will form root nodules on the root
[SPEAKER_01]: zone and they will pull the nitrogen out
of the atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have to have those nitrogen fixing
bacteria present.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you inoculate your seeds with this
bacteria, you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside, those bacteria are
plentiful and you don't need to inoculate,
[SPEAKER_01]: they will come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a cool way to know is just pull up an
established legume and look at the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: and are there little white nodules on
those root hairs?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they are, then you have the
bacteria there and the nitrogen is being
[SPEAKER_01]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does take a while for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is more of like, you know,
an overwinter kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside, plant a legume or
clover species that is going to last all
[SPEAKER_01]: winter long and then you can chop it down
and let it mix back in, cover it with
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch, compost, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do want to cut back your legumes when
they're about 50% into flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once 50% of them have begun flowering,
that's the time that you're going to want
[SPEAKER_01]: to cut back any cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is because they will start
pulling that nitrogen back out of the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: and storing it in their seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they start seed production,
you're going to start losing the nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: that you want to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to want to get it
fixed into your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest any kind of legume
nitrogen fixing cover crop to be something
[SPEAKER_01]: that was put in place over winter or while
you're not cultivating to really harness
[SPEAKER_01]: the benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you did want a fast fixing nitrogen
plant to grow while you were cultivating,
[SPEAKER_01]: cow peas would be a great suggestion for
you in a hot climate with a lack of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that along with the buckwheat,
those are two that do really well together
[SPEAKER_01]: and buckwheat will pull phosphorus out of
the soil that is insoluble and turn it
[SPEAKER_01]: into a soluble form.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many amazing cover crops
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really like, you know, play with it,
see how it does for you, try new things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about recommendations for like,
I'm just a small indoor grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually in smaller containers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you have any recommendations for
like, for me, as far as keeping a cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop within a small container,
whether it be a three gallon, five gallon,
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any difference in kind of having
cover crops in smaller containers versus
[SPEAKER_00]: larger containers or beds, for example?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean with a smaller container,
it's just not as much room for error and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to keep amending with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so honestly for a smaller container,
I would probably just go with a mulch
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of trying to cover crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead maybe take your practices of
cover cropping outside and try an outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that you have a yard,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, actually the desert is like,
really there's nothing, there's no yard
[SPEAKER_00]: back here at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dang, where are you located?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, natives plants, native species,
that's always the go-to when you're in an
[SPEAKER_01]: area that doesn't have a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would always recommend a native species
because they evolved with the environment
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for indoors, I would really recommend
cover crops on larger containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just got a grassroots fabric,
four by eight bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out grassroots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for sending that to me for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to be experimenting with
different cover crops inside in a tent to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow four by eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'll have more information for you
on how that works out inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm just transitioning from a
5,000 square foot canopy in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: outside to a four by eight tent inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be a huge scale down and
really applying things that home growers
[SPEAKER_01]: can use a lot more easily than if you had
tons of room outside to just throw seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and plants everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you mentioned companion planting
as well can have an impact on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What companion plants would you recommend
and when would you plant them as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's one thing I'd like to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would start them earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just companion planting for terpene
production is definitely something that
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously you're going to want to grow
alongside your medicinal plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So strawberries are a great one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can plant strawberries and they will
just keep on spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with strawberries is that you're
going to want to take the mother plant out
[SPEAKER_01]: after a couple of seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically you'll get a few strawberry
plants, throw them into your bed and they
[SPEAKER_01]: will reproduce and send off little rhizome
shoots and that will have a baby
[SPEAKER_01]: strawberry plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you will continue getting fruit off
of your main strawberry, your mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: For two, three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But after that, it really slows down and
you're going to want to take those mother
[SPEAKER_01]: plants out and just keep on cultivating
the babies.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spread like wildfire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever grown strawberries?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mother has up in New Hampshire.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has this and they have spread like
crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sit there and harvest them and
then all of a sudden a day later you can
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something that's a great
ground cover, cover crop companion plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will increase linalool production
in your other plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an amazing companion plant to go
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I mentioned earlier, lavender as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside and you have room,
yarrow is one that you could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's really you can just play
with it, but things that are really floral
[SPEAKER_01]: and sweet smelling are going to be that
linalool and that will be an increase in
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other companion plants are great like pest
deterrents, like I mentioned, thyme or
[SPEAKER_01]: peppermint, which mint spreads like fire
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful about where you plant your
mint because it will take off and you
[SPEAKER_01]: think you put it in a container and it
finds a way to climb out of that
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_01]: So be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Comfrey and borage are also excellent
companion plants and those are plants also
[SPEAKER_01]: that you may want to plant outside or only
if you have a really large container
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can get quite large.
[SPEAKER_01]: The great thing about Comfrey is that it
is like this bio accumulator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It meaning that it pulls up a lot of the
nutrients that are in the soil really
[SPEAKER_01]: readily and it stores them in their leaves
and it makes these huge beautiful leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can just chop and drop right on
your soil, creating a free nutrient,
[SPEAKER_01]: a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an excellent source of minerals,
a little bit of NPK in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be something that I could
recommend as a companion plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Borage is related to Comfrey.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bees love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're outside, it's an amazing
pollinator attractant.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you also need to be careful about
what pests you could be bringing into your
[SPEAKER_01]: garden when you do companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just think about like, you know,
oh, look at this beautiful butterfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what do butterflies do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They lay eggs that turn into caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do caterpillars do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They munch through plants, creating trails
for botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's a holistic approach of
looking when you are playing with other
[SPEAKER_01]: species and creating your own ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to just be aware and try
and educate yourself on what you're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: or ask me, send me a DM on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned chop and drop and I do have
a lot of new folks that tune into this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain exactly what chop and drop
is and how it's beneficial?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So chop and drop is pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is just chopping the plant down and
dropping it where it lays.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the best example I can give
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chop and drop is when you mow your lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not put the bag on your lawn mower.
[SPEAKER_01]: That right there, all of those grass
clippings are full of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, 15% of the nitrogen your lawn
requires can come from your grass
[SPEAKER_01]: clippings, reducing your need for nitrogen
fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you allow your grass to grow a
little bit longer, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_01]: more nitrogen when you cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My neighbors are always bothering me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that I live in a neighborhood,
they're like, Oh, when are you going to
[SPEAKER_01]: mow your lawn?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, well, when I don't feel like it,
because that's nitrogen, that's free
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm waiting for it to get to that height
before I chop and drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to clarify, you said,
you know, chop the plant down,
[SPEAKER_00]: put it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about like the cover crop,
for example, or you could even take like
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves off of like some people do
defoliation technique off of their plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can just drop those leaves right down
onto the surface, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're defoliating, you can just
leave the leaves unless you have a pest
[SPEAKER_01]: problem, obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But allowing it to just break down in your
soil surface is just going to add back the
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think of nitrogen with green growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talked about composting in our
last episode, we talked about the
[SPEAKER_01]: different inputs that you need for
composting, and that's nitrogen and
[SPEAKER_01]: carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whenever there is green left in a
plant, that's nitrogen present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you allow your plant matter to
decay on the surface, it is going to feed
[SPEAKER_01]: your soil and then your plants with
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bacteria love organic, fresh organic
matter like leaf litter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So bacteria are going to come up and
they're going to feed off of that nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: source.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once the green is gone, it becomes
brown and that's carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the carbon feeds the fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a full circle of life there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you if anything is lost
when you lay that down on top and it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to brown up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you if you're losing
the nitrogen or not, but you're saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria is basically coming up to the
leaf, taking all the nitrogen and bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: it down into the medium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nitrogen is a mobile nutrient,
meaning it moves with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you have any runoff and there's
green leaf matter there or any nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: that is mobile in your soil, you are
seeing that nitrogen leave and run out of
[SPEAKER_01]: your pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, with the whole living soil
system, you don't really want a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anytime you have runoff, mobile nutrients
are attaching to hydrogen molecules in the
[SPEAKER_01]: water and leaving your container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why in the United States,
we see a lot of eutrophication in our
[SPEAKER_01]: waterways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is a buildup or excess of
nitrogen and phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can be detrimental to water
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, toxic algae blooms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's terrible, terrible for the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to back up a little bit when you
kind of touched upon this is like
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing the plant is going to help with
terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, I just released a video
not too long ago where it was filming my
[SPEAKER_00]: garden inside in my grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pointed out that the plant that was
right next to the fan seemed to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome production than the other plants
that were further away from the fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a form of stress, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Wind stress is a form of stress that can
certainly help increase trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: production within the trichomes of the
terpenes, cannabinoids, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What other forms of stress can you get
into that will really help with terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: production?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, heat stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will definitely be one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That actually is also known to increase
THC content, the higher the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of studies done in Israel
that are taking this data and showing
[SPEAKER_01]: different, the same exact clone strain,
everything, and putting it through heat
[SPEAKER_01]: stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're seeing higher levels of
terpenes and higher levels of THC in
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is kind of like a sun block.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant creates its own sun block by
increasing those trichome heads to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: it from UV radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are they, like, from my understanding,
you mentioned this at the beginning of the
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, terpenes volatize, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what you're smelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you're increasing the
temperature, are you at risk of losing
[SPEAKER_00]: some of those terpenes because they're
volatizing off the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing the heat stress for a short
period of time so it doesn't, so you
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't losing terpenes or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: When your plant is alive and it's creating
terpenes, you don't really need to worry
[SPEAKER_01]: about losing them to oxidation like you
would if it was cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want to introduce heat stress to
a, like, when you're drying your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terpenes are volatile that they will
combust above 69 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are terpenes that that is,
like, that is as high as they can get
[SPEAKER_01]: before they burn off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have a plant that is alive,
and it's synthesizing terpenes constantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to see those terpenes
gone forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is actively responding to
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its physiology is changing according to
what's happening to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's living, breathing like you and me,
and think about, you know, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe when you're hot and you're running
and you sweat, your sweat's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: stinky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a terpene, kind of,
in a way, just to think about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically you're, you're generating
more terpenes that you're losing is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of what you're getting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I guess storage is another thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking about conserving the
terpenes on the storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people make the mistake
of not having the proper temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity as far for storage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people aim after that,
you know, 62%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say 58% relative humidity
within the actual container.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are ignoring the
actual temperature that the storing is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, right now it's high 70s,
low 80s, just to my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I were to have flour right here,
arguably I'm losing some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there like a certain temperature
that you stick towards for storage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I definitely try and keep it
under 69 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a cool, dark place, a great location is
the bathroom in your closet, in a dark
[SPEAKER_01]: closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically where I will store it
because you're going to have that constant
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity from showering in there and
keeping it back up, bringing that RH,
[SPEAKER_01]: that relative humidity back to a 50,
60%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll boost up to 90% when the door is
closed with the water running in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shower.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it dissipates down and depending where
you're living, obviously this would
[SPEAKER_01]: influence whether or not you keep it in
the bathroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in a place like Florida or
Oklahoma, where the outside is already 85%
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity, you don't really need to
introduce more humidity in that form.
[SPEAKER_01]: But where you're at in Las Vegas or where
I'm at in Washington, Idaho, it can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot drier and you might want to
reintroduce those, that humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really trying to keep the temperature
between 60 and 70 degrees is ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any time you go over 68 degrees,
you're starting to lose terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about storing in like your
refrigerator, which is lower than 60
[SPEAKER_00]: degrees or even some people put in the
freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any harm being done with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have a funny story about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few years ago, when I was licensed in
California, I had done an entire indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably like 30 pounds of flour
that was frozen for concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to be taking it to a lab and
they were going to turn it into a WHO
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I decided, well, me and my partner
decided to end our business relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: and we needed to sell all of our product
and liquidate assets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I thought, well, we're not going to
take this to the lab and go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to open up this bag,
this vacuum sealed bag that's been in the
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer for a few months and see what the
flour is like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was kind of like, you know,
those little peanuts from like packing and
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, like little styrofoam peanuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it felt.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had lost a lot of moisture and it was
really like dry and weird texture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still smelled great, but the moisture
level was very strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: From being in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if that's because the
moisture gets pulled out into ice and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, like condensate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why you start seeing like
freezer burn on things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause whatever moisture is in there gets
pulled out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would digress and do not put it in
the freezer if you have another option.
[SPEAKER_01]: The refrigerator tends to be super humid
and smelly as weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I would put them,
maybe if you had a refrigerator that was
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically for flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really keeping it at below 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us have air conditioning and have
our houses at 70 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And having a good cure is really going to
preserve your terpenes because when you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't cure it properly and maybe you don't
burp it, let out the off gassing,
[SPEAKER_01]: opening it up and even opening it up
brings in carbon dioxide from our breath,
[SPEAKER_01]: which can influence the curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of these things influence how the
terpenes are going to be preserved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting to that point, storing it in
your home at a nice, like if it's 72,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not really, you're not going
to lose a ton of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't stress too much about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be more worried about putting it
in the refrigerator or the freezer than a
[SPEAKER_01]: 72 degree house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have put it into a wine fridge
set to 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it seems like it's working pretty
good so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been using it for about six months or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, I have in glass jars,
which obviously, you know, getting the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature into the glass jar to be the
same, there's a slow process there,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then those Grove bags, I'm also using
those as well now and put them into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like it it's working to
conserve them for a longer period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a wine fridge is different than like a
regular food fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say wine is all about
temperature and preserving terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor in that bottle and not allowing it
to oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a great option.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even think about wine fridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have those are kind of
expensive though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spending a lot of money on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got a gifted to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was lucky enough somebody was throwing
away so I was like, yeah, I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your wine fridge turned in your plant
medicine fridge.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what else do we need to know about
terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you want to go over like some of the
different terpenes and how they affect us
[SPEAKER_00]: or what other things with terpenes did you
kind of want to cover on this episode?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all of the terpenes, all terpenes
are good for you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They all have different properties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, it's just the fact that terpenes
played this important role in plant
[SPEAKER_01]: communication through plant insect,
plant pathogen, plant to plant
[SPEAKER_01]: interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been doing some research and it's
pretty cool when you have the,
[SPEAKER_01]: like we talked about companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: One study showed that cyanide was released
by cassava plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that were planted next to peanut
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this caused the peanut roots to
release ethylene, which is a plant growth
[SPEAKER_01]: hormone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and it altered the rhizosphere and
increased the actinobacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just amazing how plants can
use terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, we just don't give them enough
credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what I want to,
you know, hit home here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that yes, we love terpenes because of
the way they smell, but what they do for
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and how they can call in bacteria,
how certain plants can put off sense to
[SPEAKER_01]: ward off insects or how a plant can
communicate with fungus, with mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by releasing a certain terpene and
telling that fungus, Hey, we're stressed
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have enough water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That that fungus can do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can communicate to any plant that is
within its mycelial network and let it
[SPEAKER_01]: know, Hey man, maybe there's a tree on the
other side of the forest that that fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: is tapped into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can say, well, this tree over here
on the other side of the forest is
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to dry out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what happens when they dry
out the bark beetles come.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys over there, let's increase our
turpentine, which is actually where the
[SPEAKER_01]: word terpene comes from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is turpentine, which is a specific terpene
that's found in pine trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the mycorrhizal fungus will go ahead
and it will hear here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm saying here, but what I'm
meaning is it just is listening to the
[SPEAKER_01]: tree's terpenes and it can sense this and
it can say, okay, I'm dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: This tree is dried out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to communicate down to the tree
on the other side of the forest and tell
[SPEAKER_01]: it, Hey, the drought's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means bark beetles are coming,
increase your turpentine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is going to ward off the beetles.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really, really hope that everyone
will just give terpenes a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in turn, they will support their
sungrown cultivators who are allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: their plants to live their most plant life
with the most biodiversity and the most
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is why sungrown is superior to
indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, you're an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you mentioned it's super interesting
with fungi, mycorrhizal fungi,
[SPEAKER_00]: how that works with the whole system
underground and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched the documentary, Fantastic
Fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've seen that one or
not, but incredible documentary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talks a lot about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mycelium network that's under the
ground and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that kind of leads into what I want to
talk about next, which is something I saw
[SPEAKER_00]: on your YouTube channel, which I just
realized you have a YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know you had one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a video that you just recently
put out that relates to what we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about, which is the bacteria to fungi
ratio in the actual medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like you mentioned, they do have an
impact on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know there were test kits out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on your video, you actually have a test
kit that you got.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're able to take a sample and you're
actually able to find out the fungal to
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so that is a microbiometer and that
was my first time using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super cool, nifty tool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very influenced by microorganisms
and microbial products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have heard that you should,
I mean, and this should be kind of common
[SPEAKER_01]: sense, but don't buy it and test your
amendment or your soil or your medium
[SPEAKER_01]: right after you've applied a microbial
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's going to skew the test
results and you may be like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: wow, I have such high percentage of
microbial biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really it's a good baseline test kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can test your medium at the end of
the cycle or the beginning of the cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: not right when you have applied any
microbial product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in this case, we went ahead and took a
soil sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see it in the video right outside
in one of my Patreon's gardens,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon has connected me to actual people
where I get to go and help them on their
[SPEAKER_01]: farm and make real friends that are like
my best friends for life now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patreon.com slash queen of the sun
grown yo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we went ahead and we took this
microbiometer, took a sample and you put
[SPEAKER_01]: it in the test tube, shake it up with a
little bit of I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They give you a little packet of powder
that you put in with the water and you
[SPEAKER_01]: shake it, let it sit for 20 minutes and
you put it on this slide and you take a
[SPEAKER_01]: picture with your phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't understand how a phone can take a
picture of a little test slide with the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil sample, the water and the powder
chemical powder and analyze the microbial
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass that is present in that sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mind blowing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can't phones do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: So microbiometer, how much do those things
cost and where can people get those?
[SPEAKER_01]: Microbiometer.com and they cost,
I believe 135 to $150 and it comes with a
[SPEAKER_01]: ton of testers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should last you like many,
many, many cycles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's like 20 test tube things
in there that you can test, 20 tests or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But besides the microbial biomass,
it also gives you your bacteria to fungi
[SPEAKER_01]: ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a lot of debate about
plant, the medicinal plant in question and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being funded fungally dominant,
preferring a fungally dominant medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like I haven't seen scientific
evidence that suggests that it needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: fungally dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think of what associates with
fungus, what plants need it, it's plants
[SPEAKER_01]: that live a really, really long time like
trees because fungus is a very slow
[SPEAKER_01]: growing organism, whereas bacteria is like
this boom and bust.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you see a disturbance in an
ecosystem such as a fire or a road grade
[SPEAKER_01]: being cut out, any kind of disturbance to
that ecosystem that has destroyed and
[SPEAKER_01]: taken away the plants, you're going to
start seeing an increase in bacteria
[SPEAKER_01]: really quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the first species to come in and
they're associated with grasses and
[SPEAKER_01]: herbaceous plants that are fast growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you'll see the legumes at road
cuts like lupin or hairy vetch growing
[SPEAKER_01]: along borders of fences because there's
been a disturbance there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you start looking for
fungus, it's in older developed ecosystems
[SPEAKER_01]: where there's old growth trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we as gardeners and farmers
practice no till because anytime you till,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're disturbing the ecosystem and you
are pushing it toward a bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now with the plant in question,
I would say that having a good balance of
[SPEAKER_01]: both is more important than trying to
assert dominance by fungus over bacteria.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason I can see that you would
want more fungal dominance over bacterial
[SPEAKER_01]: is that bacterial slime raises your pH and
this plant likes a slightly ericaceous or
[SPEAKER_01]: acidic soil similar to azaleas or
blueberries between a 5.8 and a 6.2.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so fungus grows in a slightly acidic
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be my only deduction of why
you may want slightly more fungus is to
[SPEAKER_01]: help with the pH balance of your medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know there's a lot of controversy
behind the medicinal plant, whether or not
[SPEAKER_00]: it is fungal dominant or bacteria
dominant, which one the plant prefers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they get the test results and they
find out they're dominant one way or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other, what do you recommend?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would they just find a microbial inoculant
that kind of leans towards the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're trying to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't recommend any products because
I am not a product person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would recommend creating the environment
or habitat that is best suited for the
[SPEAKER_01]: organism that you are looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with fungus, if you would like to see
an increase in your fungal population,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to provide the fungus
with food, which is complex carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fungus love grains, straw, mulch,
those kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to want to cover your soil
surface with a mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's a straw or rice hulls or
bark, something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is where you're going to see an
increase in water retention because fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: also really likes moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about where they grow in the PNW
Pacific Northwest, places that see a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so increasing your soil moisture is
going to help influence that fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: dominance or fungal ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to see more bacteria,
then feed your soil simple carbohydrates,
[SPEAKER_01]: such as yucca, molasses, brown sugar,
brown cane sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, bacteria love sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you can increase the diversity
of the sugars, either by introducing them
[SPEAKER_01]: through a tea or like we talked about,
root exudates of different species of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, specifically legumes and things of
that nature, then you will increase your
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just inoculating isn't going,
sure, you're going to have a bunch for a
[SPEAKER_01]: week or a day, but is it going to
germinate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to thrive?
[SPEAKER_01]: So many soil samples that I've looked at
under a microscope have tons of fungal
[SPEAKER_01]: spores, but the spores haven't germinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The spores are still closed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they don't have mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have enough water.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have the right environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, if you want to see more fungus
or more bacteria, you're going to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: give them the habitat that they want to
live in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really great information.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really are an inspiration when it
comes to the whole regenerative gardening
[SPEAKER_00]: side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hats off to you for doing what you do
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as your movement with the classes
and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are getting towards the end of the
episode here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's one question I like to ask
towards the end of almost every episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned, we have a lot of
beginners that are tuned into this
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to ask the guest, what advice
do you have for beginners?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make observations, pay attention,
really write things down, have a journal
[SPEAKER_01]: or a calendar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any time you do anything, just write
it down, the date that you did it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then take a look at your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day and just be like, oh,
you know, the leaves, the edges of my
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves look a little serrated today.
[SPEAKER_01]: What could that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's a little stressed or perhaps
there's a little bit of a canoeing or
[SPEAKER_01]: tacoing where it's bending in at that
marginal vein right in the center.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make observations, write it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you start having any problems,
you can go back and look at your notes and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can deduce right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can have the information ready to
ask somebody who might know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good advice there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on Instagram at Queen of
the Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find me on YouTube, Queen of the
