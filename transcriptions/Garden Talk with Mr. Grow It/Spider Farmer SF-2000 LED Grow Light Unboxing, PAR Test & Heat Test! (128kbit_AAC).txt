[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, for you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're watching Max's channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer sent me over their SF2000
LED grow light and in this video I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to unbox the unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll test the power output and I'll also
do a heat test on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about all of the
grow lights features in this video but I
[SPEAKER_00]: will leave a link in the description
section below so you can learn more about
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spider Farmer also hooked me up with a
discount code for my viewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave that in the description section
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay first thing out the box is this
cable.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cable is used for multi light
connection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can connect up to 12 lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing out the box is the user manual.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've included two rope ratchet hangers
and some wire hangers are also in this
[SPEAKER_00]: bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power cord is connected to the fixture
and here is the fixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'm going to use the
Apogee MQ620 Extended Range Power Meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This meter measures from 340 nanometers to
1040 nanometers and the measurements are
[SPEAKER_00]: in PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this your first time watching my power
test videos I do them just to give you a
[SPEAKER_00]: general idea of what the power output is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not meant to be 100% accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I take measurements in grow tents which
have reflective walls that could increase
[SPEAKER_00]: the numbers so just keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flowering coverage area for this grow
light is 2 feet by 4 feet and I'm taking
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements in a 2 foot by 4 foot grow
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This light does have a dimmer on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the power test I'll set it to 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've plugged the LED grill light into my
kilowatt meter and it shows 1.72 amps
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling 203 watts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think of these measurements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a reminder that there is a link to
this grow light in the description section
[SPEAKER_00]: below and I'll leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for watching and until
next time, peace!
