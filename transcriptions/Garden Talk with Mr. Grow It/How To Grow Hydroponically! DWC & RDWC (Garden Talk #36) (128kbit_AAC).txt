[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're at 5.8, you have access to
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant has access to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I love about
hybrid hydroponics and deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I mix it and I have full control
and I know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cracky is a fantastic growing method,
but it's limited to for certain plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changing the reservoir, the advice is
anywhere from weekly to every two weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I fill up my hydro buckets,
I always fill them up one to two inches
[SPEAKER_01]: below the bottom of the net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not for advanced growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is because it takes the grower out of
the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you ever overwatered a
plant or underwatered a plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow in deep water culture,
that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 36.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Mitchell from
Visionary Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for seven years and
he's the creator of the hydro bucket,
[SPEAKER_00]: a deep water culture hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: He talks all about deep water culture,
DWC, and recirculating deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: or DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been a highly requested topic
from you, the listeners, so I'm super
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to bring you this one today.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Mitchell from
Visionary Hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: My voice is a bit raspy, so I kind of
apologize to the listeners in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in a very smoky environment over the
weekend and it just got to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I lost my voice and a little bit raspy
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully you guys can stick through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Luckily, I'm not going to be doing most of
the talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mitchell's going to be doing most of the
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, which is a good thing, we're going
to be talking all about hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a highly requested topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had so many people over the past 30
something episodes that I've done so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just DWC, DWC, RWC, RWC, hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get into that today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually got a, most of these questions
came from me, but I did have quite a few
[SPEAKER_00]: people submitting questions through
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you to everyone who had submitted
questions in through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of great questions that you guys
submitted in this episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be awesome because I think
we cover so much in detail to all of you
[SPEAKER_00]: that wanted this DWC episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to like this one a
lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally don't grow in DWC or any
type of hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my concerns, my reasons for not
doing it, which I think we'll address
[SPEAKER_00]: today, which we'll go over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they aren't actually legitimate
concerns and I'm just overthinking things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we'll get onto that later on
into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, can you tell us a little bit
about yourself and kind of how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, thanks for having me so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really appreciate people who bring
knowledge to people to grow at home,
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow in different ways, to grow
different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in an opportunity in the world now
that, yeah, I mean, a lot of opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: are opening up for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for having me on and just
sharing all the knowledge and what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got into gardening a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pre-legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've always grown plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had house plants, but I just
kind of let house plants, I keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow them so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But pre-legalization in Canada,
when legalization was announced,
[SPEAKER_01]: I immediately knew I was going to grow
medical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always had a thing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went out and I bought the Grow Bible
and I started reading and I came onto deep
[SPEAKER_01]: water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so two years before legalization,
I just started growing deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: in my basement, getting familiar with it,
growing tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew when legalization happened,
you know, I had some experience and I was
[SPEAKER_01]: just going to roll with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've been growing ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get into that deeper hydroponics
in particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people call it DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is DWC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's also RDWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about those two things?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the difference is it's one style of
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponics, there's lots of different
styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep water culture and recirculating deep
water culture are the two is what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a deep water culture is essentially a
plant that is in some sort of medium
[SPEAKER_01]: suspended above a solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that solution contains just the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing else down there except for
roots and nutrient solution and air stone
[SPEAKER_01]: being an oxygenating the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what separates a deep water
culture from recirculating deep water
[SPEAKER_01]: culture is exactly that is a recirculating
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's just deep water culture,
it's just one container and there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: pumps or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing's moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's a recirculating deep water
culture, it's still a deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same principles apply.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except now there's water moving typically
to an external reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's reasons and I mean differences
between having and pluses and minuses of
[SPEAKER_01]: having an external reservoir versus simply
just having everything contained in one
[SPEAKER_01]: container.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what equipment is needed?
[SPEAKER_00]: You said for DWC, it's just kind of a
bucket in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you need like a net pot within
the net pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us like in detail about
what the different pieces of equipment are
[SPEAKER_00]: needed for those setups?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for deep water culture, you're going to
need a few basic things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need a bucket,
something to hold your fluid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to need something to hold
your plant and your medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to need an air pump and
air stone and an airline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That really is all that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, then you need your nutrients
and all the other stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those are the basics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can really get into deep water
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quite an affordable thing to get
into, but it's a little bit intimidating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everybody can speak to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within those net pots, you can put
different types of mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do the clay pellets, clay balls,
hydroton, or you can do cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do perlite?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you do different types of medium
within that net pot or does it have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain type?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So typically what you need for deep water
culture is you're suspending your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: above your nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your nutrient solution below is just
roots, just aerated solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say about two thirds of your
plant is submerged in that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your consumption section of your
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your upper portion of your roots is
enclosed in a net pot, some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: apparatus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people call them the top hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that are large that
contain the structure that holds the
[SPEAKER_01]: medium.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is either going to be hydroton,
which is the clay pellets.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an inert medium that's up there as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could technically use anything to hold
the plant above in the net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to be making your
solution dirty if you're using cocoa or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using soil or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be done, but it's not ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's best to keep everything really nice
and clean and go with the inert mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could dirty the water if you're using
something like soil where it just drips
[SPEAKER_00]: down in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes sense for why the people are
using that hydroton clay balls and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that because that doesn't really drip
down in there or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the things is getting
away from, I found getting away to not
[SPEAKER_01]: introduce soil every time I've tried to
introduce soil or cocoa just for the
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my garden, I find other things come a
company with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're just dealing with rockwool and
you're doing with hydroton or an
[SPEAKER_01]: apparatus, say that doesn't use medium at
all, you're not introducing any organic
[SPEAKER_01]: critters, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing alive coming into your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all washable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the pests are really easier to
control in that matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you mentioned air stones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have air stones within the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is oxygenating that water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's key.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing that's going to help
prevent something like root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Polythium, I think it's called,
is the actual name of that bacteria in
[SPEAKER_00]: there that causes the harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also that crack key method,
which I believe is just, there's no air
[SPEAKER_00]: stones, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct me if I'm wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are just sitting in the bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can actually get away with not
using air stones at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about the differences
between the two?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like kind of the pros and cons of air
stones versus a crack key method.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So crack key is a fantastic growing
method, but it's limited to for certain
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: The principle of crack key method is that
you can mix a nutrient solution and you
[SPEAKER_01]: could put your plants in your medium,
in your lid, and then put that lid in your
[SPEAKER_01]: mixed solution in a container.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's no oxygenation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no disturbance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no pH balancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no addition of anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you mix and what you put into that
container is going to have everything the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant needs to get it to harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool, but it only applies
to certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your leafy vegetables and nothing that has
to have a transition in its nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: regime.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have a plant that needs
vegetative nutrients and then has to
[SPEAKER_01]: switch to bloom nutrients exclusively and
has different nutrients that is changing
[SPEAKER_01]: for effect, that's not going to work with
crack key because you're obviously working
[SPEAKER_01]: that and something that's a very long and
uses intense amount of nutrients and stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: is not going to work for crack key.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is ways to use it for different
plants and also with cloning medical
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some neat things to do with crack
key.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one of the top questions I had
through Instagram was, can you grow
[SPEAKER_00]: organically using DWC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, I would love to be able to
grow in a pure organic sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just something that people,
it's a big box to check for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one thing that allows people to
really get into living soil and organics
[SPEAKER_01]: and just pursue that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm testing some nutrients right now,
some fertilizers and they are an organic
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I'm just testing that right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use it because I found with
organics, even introducing organic
[SPEAKER_01]: amenities, you risk the run or you don't
risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have accumulation is what it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to think of your water solution
that you have as your deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have your roots and everything in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have organics that are
physical compounds that are in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be careful how many things you
add that create sticky into the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: that film.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only handle so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at a certain point, I don't
understand all the science, but anytime
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried it, it's just you get an
accumulation of gunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes in the opposite direction of
when you don't, it's just nice and clean
[SPEAKER_01]: and white.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know everything that's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things I love about
hybrid hydroponics and deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I mix it and I have full control
and I know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Organics, I'm working on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in years to come, and who knows,
maybe very shortly, there will be some
[SPEAKER_01]: great organic products that work really,
really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, for ease of use,
especially for new growers, I stick to
[SPEAKER_01]: some semi-organic stuff that's just fully
dissolvable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all about dissolvable,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just kind of talking more about
nutrients, I know some organic lines,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're very thick.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to clog the actual lines of
the hydroponic system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about some nutrient lines
maybe that you recommend that won't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually clog the lines?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about a recirculating system
specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, going back to the difference
between recirculating deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: and deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep water culture has its advantages
because there's nothing moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no pumps happening in your house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no external reservoir with lines
and pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And crevices and cleaning in between
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hydro bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we made it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of getting away from that
recirculating system so you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have it all right in front of you,
available to interact with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, I think, may lend to more going
down that line of organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And using stuff that is a little more
gunky because you can manage it on an
[SPEAKER_01]: individual basis per plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have access down in front of the
roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see the roots as per
design of the hydro bucket and the deep
[SPEAKER_01]: water culture vessel that it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now I use crop salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that is a... Any liquid will work
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like so many people, I started off with
GH3 part, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of people start there and
they start going up to maybe some nice
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive stuff like advanced nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: They work great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many great nutrients out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian companies, American companies,
European companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also then you can get into some nice
dry nutrients where for new users,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very nice and economical where you
get a couple sacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna last you a year and you just
don't have to measure multiple things when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're mixing up your solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just get to go so many grams of A,
so many grams of B and you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the same throughout your grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just dilute it with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the big thing with nutrients,
it really doesn't matter which one you
[SPEAKER_01]: choose as long as it's fully dissolvable.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It dissolves 100% and it just looks like a
nice clean water after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there can be color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, many of the manufacturers use
color.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, that can stain your roots and
make people think, oh no, my roots are
[SPEAKER_01]: brown or orange or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you just choose a nice white,
fully dissolvable nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you'll just always be impressed with
how they look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can use liquid or powder as long as
it's fully dissolvable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're just kind of dumping them
into your DWC system with the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: water that's already in there or you're
putting into a bucket, diluting it down,
[SPEAKER_00]: then dumping that bucket of water into
your DWC system, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, so I treat RDWC and DWC,
there's a couple of things that I've come
[SPEAKER_01]: across over the years, especially now that
I have hydro buckets in my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole reason that I created the hydro
bucket was because here's what happened
[SPEAKER_01]: with growing is that I started growing
like a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I chose deep water culture because I heard
of how awesome it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked for me that I could grow in my
basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could be clean, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no coming and going with soil and
mixing and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have room for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could grow my four medical plants and
deep water culture worked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went out like anyone, I'm a home
grower and I don't want to just go out and
[SPEAKER_01]: spend lots of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the challenges of deep
water culture and hydroponics in general
[SPEAKER_01]: is if you wanted to enter hydroponics,
there was a pretty good price tag to that,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially a recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're either going to spend quite a bit
of money on a recirculating system or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to go a DIY route.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what I did is I went the DIY
route.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the very first buckets that
I made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went and got the bucket for five bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drilled the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the grommet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people, we're talking about
DIY people versus growing people,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not everybody has a drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everybody has all these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So deep water culture has kind of been
overlooked for that reason, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what happened was after going into
getting this, I found I have to lift my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to jeopardize yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I have to change this nutrient
solution, I have to lift a big tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: plant or a pepper plant or cucumber plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a bit of a disaster to be able to
get into here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you do to solve that is you go
to a recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You hook up plumbing to your buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have an external reservoir outside
of your tent, outside of your environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can service all of your
nutrient solution that's going through all
[SPEAKER_01]: four plants from your external reservoir,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that works well because now you can
scrub your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to worry about loss of
harvest because you never have to lift the
[SPEAKER_01]: top anymore to access for fluid changes or
anything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all controlled in the external
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I did is I grew in a
recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I just found that I was still
using all DIY stuff and there had to be
[SPEAKER_01]: something better than just a pail,
than a bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's when we made the hydro
bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we made the hydro bucket and we
made access to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially what this did was we
want access to the growing container and
[SPEAKER_01]: we don't want to lift the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put a reservoir outside of the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've just moved the reservoir and
attached it right onto the hydro bucket,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so now with a hydro bucket,
we don't need plumbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need an external reservoir
outside the tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just put another tent beside that
tent, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now we can have our plants on top
and they can be scrubbed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They never have to be lifted.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're treated just like a dirt plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never have to disturb it and you have
access just like you have an external
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir, but it's on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of benefits to doing this
and getting into just skipping the
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those that are listening and don't see
the actual visual, he held up just your
[SPEAKER_00]: normal, at first he held up your normal
five gallon bucket that you'd get from
[SPEAKER_00]: like Home Depot or Lowe's and it kind of
had a kind of a pipe attachment to the
[SPEAKER_00]: side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he showed up his hydro bucket,
which is a product that he created and it
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of has like a lip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess it's kind of the best way for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think to explain unless you have a
different words to explain that lip,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it gives you a way to access the
inside without really, you're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: having to remove a top at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of just kind of get in there
without having to lift up the plant like
[SPEAKER_00]: you had mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you to access the reservoir
solution, get in there and check your pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because here's the thing, if you're
growing in a bucket, how do you test your
[SPEAKER_01]: pH in your reservoir, in a convenient and
functional way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have to test your pH and you
have to keep the parameters of your
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution in check, just like your
environment, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything, it's about when you're
growing plants, if you give them the right
[SPEAKER_01]: environment, they will grow well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's two environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's your root environment of your
plant, whether if you're soil or cocoa or
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have a temperature and a water
and you're managing that environment and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're managing your plant environment
that's your light and your humidity and
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And your temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to manage that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need an easy way to get into our
solution and check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be able to remove fluid from it
and put new fluid in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're only using a five gallon
bucket or a DIY job, it's very difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: to get in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to disturb that top, you have to
lift it and move it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be done, but it's not really
very convenient.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the hydro bucket, the external
reservoir that is fluidly coupled sharing
[SPEAKER_01]: the same walls and bottom is one way to
explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a five gallon bucket with more space
added and that external reservoir on the
[SPEAKER_01]: side has a lower access point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see your roots, you can see
inside, you can see what's happening and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can access it comfortably.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drop a hose in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use a water pitcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use your, put your pH pens in your
EC pens in there and test on a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: basis, all without ever touching your
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ever lifting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially, you know, we, we made
recirculating systems without all the
[SPEAKER_01]: pumps and pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your question was, you know,
if you're not doing our DWC and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the hydro bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You would the typical five gallon bucket,
what's the easiest way to remove the water
[SPEAKER_00]: from the buckets?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I use a pony, pony pump anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: When, when, when you get into hydroponics,
there's a certain thing, few things that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need that you're just going to make
your life really nice and going to help
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just, just grow in a way that's I
say, let the pumps do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, don't, you don't, you don't,
you don't have to lift anything anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just well suited for certain
people, certain growth styles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certain ages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's a lot of people who can't
carry big bags of whatever in and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: their house up and downstairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hydroponics allows you to plug a pump
in and let it do all the lifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I love a pony pump with a small
end that you just drop in and it sucks it
[SPEAKER_01]: out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can add to your, your,
your vessel, your water vessels again,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: To top everything up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's, it's more than just the add and
removing with a pony pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's flip it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So water, why did I say it like that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Water, water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about water.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the type of water that's ideal to
use for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the best results that I've had
are reverse osmosis water, RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's just costly to create all
RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you, you have to, you need an RO
system and there is some waste involved
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It works the best, but it's not required.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't use RO water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I found my best results were coming
from it, but I couldn't grow at the level
[SPEAKER_01]: at the size of my garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just couldn't keep up with that amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still a home grower and I'm not ready
to spend a few thousand dollars on a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive RO system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's out of reach for me right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so I'm just, I'm using tap water and
I'm sure to aerate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes from, it's a municipal water
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it in a thousand liter tote.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sits there, has the chance to off
gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that, that's where I start.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have good results with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The results will be better if you do use
reverse osmosis water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you say off gas, are you talking
specifically about chlorine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have chlorine and you're
going to just, you have that smell to the
[SPEAKER_01]: water when you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously it's treated right out of the
facility when it comes out of your tap,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for it is here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you leave it sit for a week or you
put a air stone in there, you can smell
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that smell goes away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's just sometimes
something that you can do to, and there
[SPEAKER_01]: are other small, there are some products
that exist out there at our local store,
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware store.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a, I couldn't tell you what it
is, but it was a fairly affordable product
[SPEAKER_01]: that changed tap water, made tap water
suitable for plants and animals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm sure it's something that busts up
the chlorine bond and maybe just helps it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dissipate from the water because really I
think that's what we're trying to do is we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want water that is going to kill
live things.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we're really looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's in the water is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have a water source that
is 400 parts per million, that's what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: starting at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's a problem because it contains
a lot of stuff already, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're starting at zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why it works so much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you have all the space in your
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your water is essentially empty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider, consider your water is your,
your, your, obviously your fluid,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's, it's what you're delivering to
your plant as your, your battery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you start at zero or you start at
50 parts per million, you can,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's say you, you're building it up to
1000 parts per million for your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 1000 parts per million that you
have full control over.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're starting at 400, you have all
kinds of stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might already have high levels of
magnesium and calcium or who knows what.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're just adding your three part
or your nutrients to 400, you don't,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's, it's, it's problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most tap water, you know, most people
you're going to be one to 200 and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's not actively killing
everything it comes in contact with like
[SPEAKER_01]: chlorine does, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to, to keep, to Harbor any beneficials.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your water's not alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we want our water to be alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want it to be dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want our water to allow to come and
either RO out the chlorine and the stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that kills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beneficials in the water, or we want it to
aerate it and just get that chlorine out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's just water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do need to get the chlorine out of
it because you know, chlorine kills off
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off the bad microbes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or hydroponics a sterile environment
anyways, and we don't really rely on that
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial bacteria to uptake nutrients at
the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on and so forth or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so there's two ways to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're not, we don't necessarily keep
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't grow in a sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are other companies that do
it very well, do it very well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that lends to the big hydroponic
recirculating systems that, that are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, they're at an industrial
standard where you have what, how many,
[SPEAKER_01]: how many plants hooked up?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many vessels to your recirculating
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10, 20, 50, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can't afford contamination
anywhere, period.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and a lot of the, uh, uh, regulations
don't allow for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to prove that you can
grow here in Canada where you're not going
[SPEAKER_01]: to jeopardize a large crop of plants,
uh, with something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So being sterile on that level in a
recirculating system is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: important, I think, but not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, how I grow is with a live
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sterilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I start with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I'll start with, with, with,
um, you know, I start with my aerated tap
[SPEAKER_01]: water that's been sitting in my,
my thousand liter tote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'll mix that into, um,
a hundred liters, um, and that does one of
[SPEAKER_01]: my flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll do, um, you know, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, about eight or
[SPEAKER_01]: nine hydro buckets is one of my flower
rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll mix 100 liters at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, my, my starting point,
I start sterile and that is true just to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure the water going in and there's,
there's nothing harboring in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I start with a, uh, uh, silicic acid,
uh, or, uh, uh, like a, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium sulfite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so what that does is there's some
benefits there for the plant, but it also
[SPEAKER_01]: puts a pH spike and makes it quite,
um, uh, off the scale and, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not, you know, great for anything to
be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so that's where you always start in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you add your, your nutrients to
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the nutrients are in there,
uh, then I will bring the pH into balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once the pH is in balance, then I'll add
some microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll add microbial mass, um, and I'll add
some, uh, hygrosime, uh, root enzymes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are living things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure your pH is in
check and it's a, not a hostile
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise you're just, they're just going
to get fried, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So once I add those, then I put those,
then I feed out of that thousand liters or
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred liters and I just pump into my
hydro buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, that is their feed for the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually a question was,
can't you use beneficial microbes in DWC?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just answered that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about the water level?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should the water level be within the
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: The water level is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, but it's more important in a
recirculating system in the recirculating
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want that water level to never go
above a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's two to three inches below the
bottom of their net pot, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically what we're looking at it is
the, your, the top portion of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: has to breathe.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the whole dry out principle of,
of drying out plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it has to dry out from the top down
because that top third is really where the
[SPEAKER_01]: root, the plants are, uh, have a different
process than the uptake portion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the below.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so two to three inches below always
from the bottom of the net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't go above that in a recirculating
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in a deep water culture,
then you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say that just because not on,
not on, on good garden practice,
[SPEAKER_01]: not on regular practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I fill up my hydro buckets,
I always fill them up to about what,
[SPEAKER_01]: again, one to two inches below the bottom
of the net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, but sometimes I'm going away and
it's not a static environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that that fluid level is going
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going down pretty drastically in
certain times in, in the growth cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with, with, uh, uptake of different
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that if I want an extra day,
then I will fill it up right to the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the net pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get that extra two inches in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know the plant is going to say,
Oh, I'm kind of drowning, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it has no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is that that fluid is moving through
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then in a day it's down to one or two
inches, and then it's within, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: two or three more days, it's down to,
uh, uh, only two or three inches left in
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom of the hydro bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it requires service again.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the general advice that you hear
every so often is talk about changing the
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir every so often you hear about it
should be done every seven days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say you can do a 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody says you can do 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how often should the reservoir actually
be changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is, this is, uh,
this is, this is a broad area of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of a, depending on how you're doing things
for home growers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to, you, no one wants to
waste a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a variable valuable
resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always trying to conserve
everything we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and when I did grow in a recirculating
system and I had that larger external
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir, I found it, I was more grudging
to change that solution because there was
[SPEAKER_01]: more of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole principle of recirculating is
you're using volume to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the, the volume, volume is what's
moving through all the, uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: additional lines to move it through the
tent and then back into the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need X amount of volume.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is nutrient solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just, they're simply mixed to make
things move where in a, in a single
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket, you only mix what you're going to
use and it sits there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so once to two weeks is when you
should, you should change your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're sterile, then, um, you know,
there, it, there's more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, you want new, new, you want to change
it, but it's more of a system of how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's understanding, uh, a recipe in which
to, uh, uh, when to add nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: when to add water, when to pump it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say every single week and the reason
why I say that is it allows you to refresh
[SPEAKER_01]: your plant, put everything back into
parameters that they want to be in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then at the end of the week,
completely flush your plant and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: ready for the week again, if that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can go into detail on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do online on our, on our, uh,
IG page with some videos, but,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, I'm happy to talk about that here as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they can, they can always visit
the IG page.
[SPEAKER_00]: To learn more about it in detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got quite a few questions here
to continue on to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to learn more details about
that in particular, what's your Instagram?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's hydro bucket, uh, or visionary
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can be found on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we post a lot of,
uh, videos on, I call it the week in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden where I show, uh, why I wear,
how I pump out and what I do for my seven
[SPEAKER_01]: days in the garden that repeats each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is another hot topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a general range that
people can stay within for pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pH of the water solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk to us about pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the ideal range and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pH is everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH is availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're, many people have seen the,
the, the, the scales, uh, uh, essentially
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are at your, your range is 5.5 to
6.5 in hydroponics in deep water culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just to be clear cause cocoa is
hydroponics as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are not the same pH ranges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So deep water culture, hydroponics,
you're 5.5 to 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in that range, your plant is not
going to be stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has availability to move water and
function and availability to certain,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, uh, nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it, if 5.8 is ideal, if you're at 5.8,
you have access to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant has access to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it goes below 5.8, you're going,
you're not going to have access to the
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that is at the higher end of the,
of the scale at 6.5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like if you go to 6.5, you're not
going to have access to the stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: below 5.8.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can float around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, your plants, the plants know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to just be right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're not there, oh no,
if it's 5.5 to 6.5, it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we keep it in range.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it's in range for four days,
then you have the ability to, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, you know, check it and adjust it
every four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you have to keep your pH in range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the best ways to
stabilize the pH?
[SPEAKER_00]: From my understanding, if you have air
stones in there, your pH could,
[SPEAKER_00]: is more prone to drift.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are some of the best ways that you
can stabilize pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, I hear this often is that it
causes drift and, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: air stones in deep water culture,
they're just part of deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're always in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and I don't always fight with,
with pH drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a combination of having
nutrient solution that is well dissolved,
[SPEAKER_01]: having a happy environment, um,
um, and not an environment that's too
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found I had more pH swing when I was in
a recirculating system, cause I would have
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have multiple nooks and crannies,
different things pulling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just seemed like a more dynamic
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find when growing in individual deep
water culture, hydro buckets, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can stabilize it quite quickly if I
really want to, uh, because I have that
[SPEAKER_01]: nice access on the front of the hydro
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can, I can, I just use pH down really
is what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I've found by using magnesium sulfate
or sulfite, uh, uh, uh, when I,
[SPEAKER_01]: when I, before I, when I start my mix of
my fluid and then I bring that high pH
[SPEAKER_01]: down, uh, to 5.8 before I add my
beneficials, I find those two additives
[SPEAKER_01]: seem to stabilize with a good soluble,
uh, solution, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good soluble fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be well so because, cause that's
part of the problem I'm finding with
[SPEAKER_01]: certain uh, uh, things is if the solute,
if the solution is dynamic and it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: fully dissolved and you mix it and then
you put it in with your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's even more dynamic because the
plant is up taking water.
[SPEAKER_01]: The concentration of your solution could
be, it could be concentrating,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if not, everything is dissolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have an addition to your fluid that's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you balance it once, maybe it's
just the air is creating a good
[SPEAKER_01]: environment to dissolve what's hasn't been
dissolved yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that, that, that, that addition of
dissolved particles into the water needs
[SPEAKER_01]: more balancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can really, I can really balance
my water and it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's once I, once I make my notes and I
get my, you know, if it's a straight,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a plant that I'm used to growing,
um, and I, I dial it in and I know the pH
[SPEAKER_01]: is in range.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't even check it for four days,
let alone balance it each day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just about using your, uh,
paying attention to stuff and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, uh, I really think, uh,
dissolving things well.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with pH, a lot of people talk about
another measurement, PPM or EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should the PPM or EC range be during
the different stages of growth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So light, um, you know, like so many
people when we grow growers like to just
[SPEAKER_01]: push, push, push, and we're encouraged by
so many packages by nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers, but this isn't necessarily,
uh, I think it's a misunderstanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you can, you want to be in a
vegetative state, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in small plants and hydroponics,
you, you're, you're only, they don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: much, you know, leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they're just after a bit of nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really what they're after.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have massive root systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you're under 400 parts per million,
500 parts per million.
[SPEAKER_01]: That, that, that does a lot for seedlings
and clones, uh, under, uh, once you're
[SPEAKER_01]: into a vegetative state where you're
growing a plant that you really want it to
[SPEAKER_01]: get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you, you can go from, you know,
uh, uh, if it's, if it's bigger,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's bigger than a football,
a basketball, then, then I think you can
[SPEAKER_01]: push something at that point, uh,
if it's going to go from a basketball to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, two to three times its size,
then that's a plant that could probably
[SPEAKER_01]: start getting up towards to a thousand
parts per million of vegetative nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're switching your plant to a bloom
nutrient at that point, um, you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere from a thousand to 1500 parts per
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 1500 parts per million that's on the,
the manufacturer's bottle, that's for
[SPEAKER_01]: people who enrich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are correct in telling us 1000 to
1500, but you have to understand that your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants need more when they're in a CO2
environment, they're going to use more.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is what that reading is for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people, what I recommend when you
start using a nutrient line is you start
[SPEAKER_01]: at half, whatever they say, go half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, um, it's, it's easy to give your
plants a little bit more uh, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, then, uh, the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, uh, for the most part, if you're,
if you're around a thousand for biggish
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, whether you're in veg or bloom,
you're going to, you're going to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: good space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then talking about water temperature,
the water temperature is too low.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature is too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could run into problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should the temperature be of the
water?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the temperature should be 68 to 72
Fahrenheit is what we're looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, that's kind of the ideal range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be, um, anywhere down to below
64.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get, you're going to have
slower growth once you get below 64
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you get above 76 degrees,
you're really risking, uh, competition,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is dissolved
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have cold water, it holds oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that oxygen, the water is full of
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's very, uh, uh, it's a very,
uh, happy, safe environment for,
[SPEAKER_01]: for good microbes and, and not for bad
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and as the water gets hotter and
hotter, uh, there's just not that much
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, that's why air stones are really
important, uh, to get them in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: just bubble, bubble, bubble in a,
and keep that, that water cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, you can be anywhere from 64,
I'll say, to, to 78 on the very high side
[SPEAKER_01]: of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I recommend again, not a sterile
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're doing this, you're going to
look, you're going to want to do enzymes,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, and, and certain additives to your,
your grow because that these enzymes
[SPEAKER_01]: inhibit the ability for root rot and
things to come into your, your zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to get the same yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're growing at 78, but you're not
going to lose your plants to root rot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big difference there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're still going to have a yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for some of us, maybe your summer
yield is, is, is, you don't have as big of
[SPEAKER_01]: a yield in the summer cause it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to rely on your
bigger yields in the winter.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's actually my main concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I haven't done DWC is,
is controlling water temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my natural, you know, house is
like 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what my water temp would
potentially be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you get into the high temps,
you talked about, you know, root rot is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the main things that people get
when they're running into the high temps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned enzymes as a way to kind of
help deal with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything else that you can use to
deal with root rot?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think hydrogen peroxide is
something I've heard in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, you know, I, I think it's about not
having a practice that doesn't allow it in
[SPEAKER_01]: the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is, this is where, uh,
you know, we get into the conversation of
[SPEAKER_01]: why I just never went back to
recirculating systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I was sure I was going to,
you know, I made a recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I made a hydro bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I got the hydro buckets in my garden
and I said, I got to hook this to these
[SPEAKER_01]: things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just never did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just put another tent and put more hydro
buckets and then another tent and put more
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro buckets because the hydro bucket
allows me to control temperature and not
[SPEAKER_01]: use a chiller 24 seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and, and why that is,
is, is that you add on the first day of
[SPEAKER_01]: the week and then you add in your ideal
temperature of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is different than a recirculating
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to add 68 degree water in a
recirculating system, it's going to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pumping water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have multiple, you have one pump for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's pumping through a heat exchanger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially it's going through tubes that
are in your hot environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going into your,
your vessels, your, your, your plant
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's draining out a drain line
back to your external reservoir where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: picked up heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's done its job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so people will need a chiller because
that water cannot go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot stay at the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so we'll start, we go from 68 and we
start going up, uh, with a hydro bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: and the single deep water culture grow
environment, you can sidestep that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can, you can start with 68 degree
water in a single deep water culture hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in four days from when you first
added your ideal solution, your parameters
[SPEAKER_01]: have been getting out of, out of check
your, your, your parts per million have
[SPEAKER_01]: been getting out of check your,
your, your pH and your temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all been sliding away from optimum,
but every four days you get to top it up
[SPEAKER_01]: with cold water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, you know, it, it, every four
days we get to make it perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get to do that with a
recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to make it good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have to keep it ideal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, I, you know, they kick on and off,
but you're using more water and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: picking up more heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas a hydro bucket, you're really not
adding any heat in a, in a, in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a individual container.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this allows us to, I still have a
chiller, but I only use my chiller for an
[SPEAKER_01]: hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre mix just to get my temperature of my
solution to where I want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's only for three months a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the year, I use a heater
because my water is too cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so if I was in a recirculating system
though, I'd be using my chiller all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would never, I rarely use a heater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I would, I would always be using the
chiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's trying to portray the
difference of, of getting your optimum
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your optimum pH, your optimum part per
million, and then put it in your deep
[SPEAKER_01]: water culture environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's good for four days, mix up some,
some nice cold water, get it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for another four days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't need a chiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we may even be able to manage this of
just cold water out of your tap depends
[SPEAKER_01]: where you live.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this always allows us to keep that
temperature in check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get deeper into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chiller because it was actually a lot of
questions in regards to chillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk to us about, you know,
how many Watts is a typical chiller?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it can get very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, if you're running a RDWC
and you're running that chiller 24 seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, it can be pretty expensive there and
it might not be worth it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many Watts is a typical chiller?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much does it cost and how do you
calculate the size of the water chiller
[SPEAKER_00]: you need for your system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, a water chiller, you need a water
chiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to get a water chiller,
you need a chiller and you need a.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pump to circulate that chiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't come with their own pumps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need a secondary pump as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, I mean, that's hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pumps here and there, especially
if it's recirculating, uh, they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones here in Canada, they're based on
horsepower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but that equates what I'm looking at
to, you know, anywhere from two to 400
[SPEAKER_01]: Watts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think is what you're going to,
you're going to have for a water chiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, uh, you know, that's another light,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if that's running on a regular
basis to keep a more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fluid, uh, at a smaller temperature,
that's that, that could be another light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be another plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, water chillers are necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't know if they're necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water temperature control is necessary,
whether it's a heater or a water
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people think just because you
say deep water culture that you must have,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, a chiller, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and it's going to be an
additional cost and it's going to be all
[SPEAKER_01]: these additional things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I say, you know,
rethink individual deep water culture
[SPEAKER_01]: buckets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we get to turn that, that,
that, that chiller off.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to, we get to save money and in a
lot of ways and getting away from a
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculating system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the chiller, will nutrient salts
impact the life of a chiller?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the viewer question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, you know, I, I, I think like anything,
whether it's your pony pump or your
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, you want to flush everything
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, how you do that in a recirculating
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, um, I would say if you want your
chiller to last a long time, uh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you should probably disconnect it every
once in a while, uh, and, and clean it,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, once or twice a week,
just to, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not going to be great to
have an internal system that needs to be
[SPEAKER_01]: cleaned, that never gets cleaned,
that has a stalled accumulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned the words flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to talk about flushing the plant at
the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So highly controversial topic for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say you should flush your
plants, which is basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in a hydroponic system is you're,
you're removing the nutrient solution out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the system and just having plain water
in there for a period of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be five days, some people say
seven days, some people say 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your take on flushing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you recommend people to, to flush at
the end of their cycle?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my experience, uh, I've had the best
results, um, in a well-rounded feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: program that ends with pure water.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can call that a flush or I think
it's more important to put it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to just pound nutrients into a
plant and then simply flush it for two
[SPEAKER_01]: weeks, you're not going to get the same
result as someone who fed it properly for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first three weeks, transitioned to
something that was more appropriate for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next three weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for the final two weeks had
another product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for that last week went to just
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is, that process is what gives a
nice, smooth, clean, product at the end,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, with no bitterness or bad tastes or,
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, it, it's not so simple as just a
straight up flush at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the magic trick.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, there are some things that
I, that, that I can say about that time
[SPEAKER_01]: though, which could confuse people,
uh, or just, just make it more,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, just not clear is those last couple of
weeks, if you're think about a tomato,
[SPEAKER_01]: think about a, uh, a nectarine that gets
to ripen on the tree that gets to ripen on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you walk up to something and you pick
it off and it's been ripe tree ripened and
[SPEAKER_01]: you pick it off and it doesn't have to
ripen on the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have to cure and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's, it's really got to stay on
as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's something to be said with
certain strains and how you grow in
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing your plant to mature when it's
not under pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it, it, it only can do what it
can do at certain stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pounding it with nutrients and then
just giving it a flush at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't, isn't, isn't going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, you draw it out properly through
all the, the portions of it, but then if
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't flush versus you flush for me,
it's more of a ripening process,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You, you, you, you, you could have that
week or two, um, that, that just creates
[SPEAKER_01]: a, um, that speak people speak,
speak to a smoother flavor or this and
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavor is something that I was going to
bring up next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's some people who swear by
growing in soil, growing organically that
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor is going to be much better than
growing hydroponically, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's hydroponic grows that
say, you're going to get the best flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world growing hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, what's your take on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hydro flavor growing hydroponically,
the flavor versus growing in soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could experience both on a side
by side basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I love science and I love knowing
the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: The truth that I do know is if you are
hydro and you crush it, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: blow doors off.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to say, wow, that's
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in living soil and you crush it,
people are going to go, wow, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that, that, that's what's going
to happen in my personal experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're in living soil, um,
you know, I've had some living soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, uh, stuff that has just been so
flavorful and, and, and such a great
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, and I think it translates when
you're straight up after, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: not oils and stuff, but, uh, uh,
uh, you know, uh, organic product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that's a nice way to grow,
but, but there's, there's also the
[SPEAKER_01]: component when you're talking about
hydroponics, you have full control,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about a couple of things
where, you know, you got a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: topics there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens with leaving it to nature or
taking full control or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, hydroponics, we have full control so
we can really make it do exactly what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can give it everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I like to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to give it everything it needs to
give, let it do what it wants to do at its
[SPEAKER_01]: full potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of a similar, you know,
mantra of, of, of organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what I do know for sure is we grow for
what's on the organics, not the organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We specifically have strains that are for,
uh, washing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we know that the expression of what
we do, uh, and what we create as our final
[SPEAKER_01]: product, uh, is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll put that up against anybody
growing in anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That being said, if someone has done their
best to grow some amazing organic product
[SPEAKER_01]: for consumption, um, you know,
uh, uh, there may be something to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that better in flower, but I can't speak
to it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I really think it's, um,
um, it's a big conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say it's about what works best for
the individual for growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, if, if you grow and you grow what
grows well for you and, and you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: good successful product in the end,
that's a success.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter what, what you used,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the top growers in the different
categories are all going to have a wow
[SPEAKER_01]: product, every one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really, until the science comes out,
until I could have more information,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, you know, I'm going to say grow it
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of new folks that tune
into my channel and they're either just
[SPEAKER_00]: starting out in DWB, C or they're about to
start out in DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for someone who is
brand new to growing hydroponically?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be intimidated with it and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, go out and get a single hydro bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, this is the thing is that
people, people are intimidated by the
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rightfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they think that they need a chiller.
[SPEAKER_01]: They think they need a DIY in a drill or
they think they need pumps and pressure
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're going to flood their house.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many things that turn people
off hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and then say, uh, or it's a price tag,
you know, all those things disappear.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just have 1500 bucks, you could
take roll into a $1,500 and, and it's real
[SPEAKER_01]: simple and you're going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell people, get the, we have a
product that allows you to just try
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics without a big bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can get into a hydro bucket,
net pot, uh, uh, uh, hydroton,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, air stone, air pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's packages for under a hundred
dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take it home and you get to just try
deep water culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why I say, it's not for advanced
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for new growers is because it takes
the grower out of the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times have you ever overwatered a
plant or underwater to plant when you grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in deep water culture that doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: You literally fill it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mix it, fill it up and it's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why deep water culture grows so
fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep water culture will grow in vegetative
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: 30% faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a significant difference when
you're talking about dollars and cents on
[SPEAKER_01]: large scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about production is
30% faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an extra crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's a lot of things that happen
with, uh, uh, with that, but why I think
[SPEAKER_01]: deep water culture works really,
really well for new growers is that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, you get to mix it, you get to put it
in and then it just has what it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to water and you're going
to have lifestyles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was a big thing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to be able to leave for a
couple of days and come back and your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants just sitting there growing and you
can, you can conveniently check the parts
[SPEAKER_01]: per million, the temperature and the,
uh, the, uh, pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it's good, you're good for another
couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes back, so it has
everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are just there to give it what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do that, it goes crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Deep water culture grows like nothing
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you just have to manage yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just don't be intimidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get, uh, uh, get, get your gear and
try one plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hear there's no going back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, the way you said it there and then
what you've said so far within this
[SPEAKER_00]: episode, I mean, you, you make me a little
bit more confident to try it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I mentioned that I did have concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think most of them have kind of been
addressed, at least the way you explain it
[SPEAKER_00]: with, uh, the hydro bucket in particular,
not running the art DWC with a reservoir
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it is can be a little bit more
beneficial in some ways, just doing DWC
[SPEAKER_00]: with the hydro buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might have to give it a try.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just might have to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we have, uh, you can find us on
Facebook, on YouTube, on IG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the stuff in the garden I is,
uh, IG is, is my main platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I share.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get that from there onto
Facebook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we are, uh, you know,
trying to give the YouTube some more love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, uh, yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a website, visionaryhydro.ca.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we're going to be updating our
website.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, uh, it could be polished.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not great, but, uh, we're available,
uh, uh, for purchase on our website.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're available for purchase on Amazon and
lots of retailers around, uh, and we are
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to make a presence everywhere we
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, uh, Toronto Lyft, uh, expo coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're going to have that, uh,
if we can make it down to Vegas,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know if this is going to be the
year for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, but then next year, definitely we're
going to be looking at doing more,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, you know, all the big trade shows if
we can, uh, and, uh, uh, any cups or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we hope to attend all of
those in, in big fashion.
