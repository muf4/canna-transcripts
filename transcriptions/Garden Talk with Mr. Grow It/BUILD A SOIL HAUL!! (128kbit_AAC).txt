[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody, if you that don't
know me my name is Chris aka MrGrowit and
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome to my talk channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got something a little bit different for
you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did some shopping over at Build The Soil
on Black Friday when they had some really
[SPEAKER_00]: good deals going on and I figured I'd do
this shopping haul video to show you what
[SPEAKER_00]: I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll be able to see the deals that I
got and also I'll be using these products
[SPEAKER_00]: in my garden so this is kind of a sneak
peek on what you'll see upcoming on my
[SPEAKER_00]: channels in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did pay for these items so this isn't a
sponsored video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the normal price of the
item, what I paid for the item and then at
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the video I'll do a final
tally.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you don't know I am a home
grower so I didn't buy thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars worth of stuff but I did spend a
good chunk of change here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the items in this video you may
actually use in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do comment down below and let me
know how you use them in your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Build The Soil does have recommended usage
instructions on their website however
[SPEAKER_00]: there are other ways to use it beyond the
website so let me know how you use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright let's get into the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay as you can see here I have two boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's open up this box first.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this box there's just one item.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Build The Soil Craft Blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nutrient pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25 pound food grade bucket is what I got.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have this in smaller sizes but I
opted for the bigger size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $80 I actually got
it for $52 so pretty significant savings
[SPEAKER_00]: on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of good things about
their craft blend and I'm really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: to try this one out for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opening up the next box.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing out the box is kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is organic kelp meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got the three pound bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $20 and I got it
for $18 so saved a couple bucks here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, Diatomaceous Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is food grade Diatomaceous Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: One pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their small bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $7.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it for $6.30.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next thing out the box is their premium
insect frass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got their small bag which is four
pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it on sale for $17.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is organic alfalfa meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got their small bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.5 pounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $12.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it for $10.80.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next up, Build-A-Flower top dress kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got their smallest size which is a two
gallon bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price is $20.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it on sale for $18.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing in this box which I'm
taking out now is Build-A-Soil worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with the half cubic foot bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have a two gallon bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I decided to get something a little bit
bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $30.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually got it for $18 so almost half
price.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard a lot of positive things about
their worm castings that they're very high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality so definitely looking forward to
trying them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly I wanted to show my support by
buying some merch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went with the Build-A-Soil family farms
t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normal price on this is $25.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it for $22.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did stumble across a 5% discount code so
I saved $8.15.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings us up total to $154.95.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offered free shipping for some of the
items but not all the items so I did pay
[SPEAKER_00]: $10.56 for shipping.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings the grand total to $165.51.
[SPEAKER_00]: Adding up all the normal prices that I
mentioned with shipping without the
[SPEAKER_00]: savings without the discount code ended up
being $229.56.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my total savings was $64.05.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too bad of a savings there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again drop a comment down below if you use
any of these products and let me know how
[SPEAKER_00]: you use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Links to all the products that I mentioned
in this video will be down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outro card here, the video on the
left, I talk about incorporating molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: into your garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I show you one way to feed and when to
feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the video on the right is
automatically generated by the YouTube
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm.
