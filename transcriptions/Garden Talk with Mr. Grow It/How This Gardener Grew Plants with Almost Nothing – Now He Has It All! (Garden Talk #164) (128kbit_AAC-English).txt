[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast,
where we interview growers from all over
[SPEAKER_02]: the world, both beginners and experts,
seeking to learn more about what they know
[SPEAKER_02]: about gardening and how they do things in
their garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up, everybody?

of Pimp My Grow Season 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: He started out gardening with a severe
lack of equipment, and after winning Pimp
[SPEAKER_02]: My Grow, he now has it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: He talks about what his setup entailed and
how he grew his plants before versus how
[SPEAKER_02]: it is now after winning the setup.

[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, yo.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming onto the podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the winner of the AC Infinity Pimp
Your Growth Season 1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a year since you've actually
had the new setup from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm really excited to sit down with
you today and really talk about before
[SPEAKER_02]: when you had the bare bones basics,
almost nothing for growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: No equipment to having it all in a
complete setup, automation and all that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really looking forward to hearing about
your progress over the past year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it should be a good
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate you actually bringing
me along and giving me a chance to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since a year has been a lot like the
process has changed so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't believe it's been a year,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Time has been flying.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's weird, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we get too deep into talking
about things, can you give us an
[SPEAKER_02]: introduction?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go by Sol, brother seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm originally from Los Angeles,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into garden gardening, not really
intentionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll say my first time planting anything
at all was probably about like elementary
[SPEAKER_00]: school.
[SPEAKER_00]: School ages, just with my grandmother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was raised with like my cousins,
my sisters, my brothers all in one house.
[SPEAKER_00]: My grandmother had a house that was big
enough to where like my mom, anybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: would have problems that needed like
places to stay and go all to my grandma's
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody else is busy.
[SPEAKER_00]: My cousin's like doing like they were
dancing like in dance crews, like doing
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know how to do none of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my time I was spending with my
grandma, like in the garden, like just
[SPEAKER_00]: learning random things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even realize I was learning at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was too busy into bugs and like rolly
pollies and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was already in the dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she was like, oh, hand me this,
hand me that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew peas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I think they were snow peas,
the first pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went over to Home Depot, grabbed one of
the burpee packs and threw that alongside
[SPEAKER_00]: of her actual plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that was my first sign of
sprout.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And getting into your grow style,
Crick Miframong, you're indoor only.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you're in soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then are you growing with organic
inputs or synthetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going, I'm growing with organic
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: My last round, I did try synthetic,
but it ended up being like a synthetic mix
[SPEAKER_00]: that was not the best idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before that I was organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I'm going back to organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the best way for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I was able to like get more
time on my plants, embed or anything like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had any issues, it would give me a
couple of days to fix those issues rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than immediate same day with cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you fuck up, it's gonna show you
like today or tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you only got the next day or the day
before to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not, you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was just a little stressful for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to learn down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if you're growing cocoa as a
beginner, then you got to do a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: education and a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you got to watch a lot more videos,
read a lot more books, buy as many books
[SPEAKER_00]: as you can before you actually grow the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I was to advise another beginner,
I'll tell them to grow in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because it's going to give them time
to actually learn what they need to do and
[SPEAKER_00]: learn about cocoa while you're growing the
soil and then go back to cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think each way has its own kind of
benefits and drawbacks, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many like pros and cons to
growing in all these different methods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it kind of comes down to trying
things out, like you mentioned,
[SPEAKER_02]: and finding out what works best for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil does suck with like overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can overwater and it will kind of stay
there for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cocoa, if you overwater, it's
probably going to run out and then you get
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of turned up to heat or do whatever
with your BPD to get that water out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil, you're going to get PM if you try to
do all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the only difference that I've
found.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty sure there's a lot more I got
to learn down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, I feel like soil was a
better thing for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know based off of like previously being
into reptiles and bugs and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I know what just needs to go into
soil to keep it living, soil to keep other
[SPEAKER_01]: things living.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just the easiest way to go for
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you on that one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to warp back to your old grow
setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretend like you're walking into your grow
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you explain what equipment you had
back then, how it was set up, how many
[SPEAKER_02]: plants you were growing, so on and so
forth?
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, when I previously, I would say
like a month or two before the pin micro
[SPEAKER_00]: before you guys all came out, I was like
trying different things that I was on
[SPEAKER_00]: offer up and I was on my Facebook groups,
like getting different tents and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: they were all like tents that would have
like holes and a little rip on the side or
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's the room that you guys ended
up coming in that had a couple of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you go back to my YouTube a
couple of previous videos before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a huge 10 by 10 I got from somebody
on offer up with no like I still have a
[SPEAKER_00]: small light in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no intake fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no like fans move around the
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept walking in that one room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys came in to help build up it
pretty much you couldn't even walk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like you walk in barely did this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Crack the door and walk in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was only able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way I'm going to be able to do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is super cheap, like almost camping
tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ended up taking that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, I had so many plants
that it just wasn't working out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how to like control my BPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know how to do any of that,
especially with the stuff I had also
[SPEAKER_00]: trying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would watch videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew what I was supposed to get target
wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't hitting for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And areas and different type of tent that
wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally when you guys hit me up,
Joe told me he was like, yo, this is this
[SPEAKER_00]: is really dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I see everything you're doing,
but we can't come with these plants about
[SPEAKER_00]: this has to be proper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought that was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you know, this is super dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ended up basically making everything
the way it needed to be to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to have a dope show.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I took so many plants to my
girlfriend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the big you haul boxes that you
hang those in, like pack those in and took
[SPEAKER_00]: all my plants to my girlfriend's house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that time that I had to bring
everything back and everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just everything was so dead and
everything is so bent over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, it was wild, a wild time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely a moment to remember forever,
but it's such a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember walking into your old setup and
you had the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you, how were you, it was on some
sort of, I'm trying to think of what do
[SPEAKER_00]: you even call that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a, uh, two, two tripod posts for
like regular lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like the, uh, we got the brain,
but two regular, um, soft light sticks,
[SPEAKER_00]: tripods and a pole across it for hanging
backdrop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had a Viper spectra one 50 on one
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe, yeah, I think two Viper
spectra is hanging on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just giving the plants enough light
to keep them alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an open room at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no air exhausting out the room
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of just like not even a sealed
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, when you guys came,
I was like on the verge of like my,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was almost over for my plants,
like almost over for my growing career in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know that it could go any
farther or go like I had all these dreams
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff, but I didn't know that I could
keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't be forward to keep going any of
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you guys reach out and I actually
like, uh, not one, I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause, uh, I originally seen the link when
my friend sent, sent the link and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a video already made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no reason for me to even sign up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I signed up and actually got hit up
and I was like, there's no way I've never
[SPEAKER_00]: won anything in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are people I watch every at that
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching your two channels from the
stash, this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, there's a guy named John Kohler,
um, grow your greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like one of my favorite YouTubers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was watching those three channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know, but I was doing it all
day long and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I was trying to learn from
basically all those channels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like what actually teach people to
grow different plants, um, fruits and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, more things than the normal
community would assume that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, when I got a chance to meet you
guys, that's why I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, Chris, like you have no
idea what the, I respect it more because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's your knowledge is, uh,
alongside with other plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many different plants that
you can grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people focus on one or two
different plants, but, uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they all bring in their own unique
challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going back to the light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually kind of innovative having those
on the soft box tripods.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess that's the way you're
able to adjust it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember you didn't even have like light
ratchets on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was just like, no, it was two
string and like other things that would
[SPEAKER_00]: look like rub.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like ghetto police system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You definitely had a lot of struggles
there from the lighting to no intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fan, no ventilation, no oscillating fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time that that place
was like the building was like from the
[SPEAKER_00]: eighties or seventies, like filthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, it was so hard to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to cut you off with that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm out of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heat issues, airflow issues, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just not optimal for growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to ask, how did this, you know,
lack of equipment impact, plant health,
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, overall growing efficiency?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I would say, I guess I'm getting into
later when you ask about the new
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment, trying not to lean more towards
that right now, but I would say it was
[SPEAKER_00]: just so hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, uh, I'm learning now that it's
not really all about like, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: as much light intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause everybody is like, I understand it,
but I'm believing air flow is way more
[SPEAKER_00]: important, way more important airflow,
getting rid of the air and bringing in and
[SPEAKER_00]: keeping the freshest air.
[SPEAKER_00]: If not the air that that biome or whatever
it is, whether it's for plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is, keep that air to itself or
make fresh air in that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have the best driving
environment that you want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Besides like light light is going to like
in every environment needs their own
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even like how they say the,
this is weird, but how they say the world
[SPEAKER_00]: spins, like our light is going to change
for us throughout our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't say that needs to stay like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only 50 years later is going to be,
the rules are going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a lot more, um, a little
stoner thought, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause back then you weren't even really
controlling the environment, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Temperature, relative humidity,
CO2, air circulation, all of that was kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like, let's say neglected, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you just didn't have the equipment
to do anything.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a, I had a small six inch like a AC
infinity fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got from, uh, it's a growing in
cocoa indoors on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, he actually was the one that was
like, yo bro, you should just actually
[SPEAKER_00]: start growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you should make a YouTube,
you should make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, why would I do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, why would I show people grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, he was actually growing all
those for years beforehand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I was working with him to
learn like different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but he actually was like, yeah,
well, I'm the one that told me,
[SPEAKER_00]: yo, you kind of know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that little small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Intake thing that I had was, uh,
I didn't understand why it wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have the key into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have, like, it was just open.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using it as a fan to blow out,
uh, the air from one side of the tent at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would leave the other side open.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was just cleaning the air at all
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was doing something,
but not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was making everything smell way louder
than it needs to smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And plants look shitty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Complete shambles, I think is a good way
to explain your grow setup, but things
[SPEAKER_02]: have changed, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's fast forward to your new grow setup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Explain what your grow room looks like
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, um, currently I have a,
since, um, I have moved back to like with
[SPEAKER_00]: family and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a four by eight set up like behind
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a two by two, the propagation tent
for, um, seedlings, but I've just been,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, working with a four by eight and a two
by two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have, um, the five by five to work
with here at this location.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the, um, other concern with my cousin,
um, Earls Bluntworth, I've been trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: like tell people about him on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earls Bluntworth, he's, uh, just getting
into growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's, uh, in Victorville, actually
like the Valley side of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing with like, uh, Chubbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I'm like really into Chubbs
because, uh, my cousin's son has,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, seizures like constantly sometimes
every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes mom was like sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to Chubbs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yo, like that story,
everything you did really inspired me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I helped my cousin have him do
something and give him something to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, so Chubbs was like, yeah,
if you want, like come through my crib
[SPEAKER_00]: sometime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still haven't been, but that little
thing, like people being actual real
[SPEAKER_00]: people, I, I assumed when I see like,
AI pictures or like a cartoon on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram, I just, I don't know why some
of these people are fake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're like not real people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I see people like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chubbs has never had that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chubbs has a real picture of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I see people and I hear realistic
things, it reassures so much for me,
[SPEAKER_00]: bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are so many nice people in this
community that will literally take their
[SPEAKER_02]: shirt off your back for you if needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, it's really, really cool to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, from what I remember when the new
setup with AC infinity, I know you had
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned that you're no longer in that
location that we set up the grow room in,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a different location,
but back then it was, uh, I think you had
[SPEAKER_02]: two full by eights, a five by five and a
two by four, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a drying, a dedicated drying
tent, which I think you're using as a five
[SPEAKER_02]: by five.
[SPEAKER_02]: The two full by eights were both for
growing plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the two by four was for clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And seedlings, is that right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I wanted to do, but I ended up
growing so many, like I would just pop
[SPEAKER_00]: these every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have the problem for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm saying I have the two by two and
four by eight, but there's, there's beans
[SPEAKER_00]: in my bathroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's beans in my closet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's beans anywhere I can fit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every couple of days I'm popping
beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that was a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, like I said, I have the two four by
eights and five by five and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: I forgot what the other one's size was,
but, um, I ended up having two veg tents,
[SPEAKER_00]: two and two flower tents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a flower tent that was ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a flower tent that was like
probably two, three weeks after that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was like steams in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything was pretty much on a three
week, like pretty close cycle to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, um, when I learned or,
um, at that point, I kind of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, got offers where I thought was like a
job opportunity to move out of state and
[SPEAKER_00]: like work in the flower business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh man, this is going to be
dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, whatever I'm going to do,
chop everything down, pack this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I actually let a male rock out in this
room and then cross to my females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I get to location, I don't have to
take any clothes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to like try to like keep
anything alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I get to my location, I run
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of what ended up
happening, but I still have to cut
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and flower a little bit early,
probably like week seven, week eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: like early eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, yeah, doing all that and cutting
everything down was kind of a buzzkill,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not getting that opportunity made me
realize and maybe reach back out to the
[SPEAKER_00]: family members are like, yeah,
we need to move back to LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I ended up moving back to Cali
and it's so much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I see my family every day,
like, and I had the plants growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was, uh, I had the plants, but every
day, like I only ate and I only like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I only did things like 0.1 miles away from
where I was watching everything at all
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the people invited me some where I
would pop out for like 15 minutes and then
[SPEAKER_00]: they were like, where are you going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought someone was like trying,
you know, get what they had to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was a bad area in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lived where we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like right where the guy got his
face eaten off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's terrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall going to this new setup
things, it sounds like things have gotten
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot easier for you, you know,
going from just an open room.
[SPEAKER_02]: To where you really don't have the
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have the flexibility to have
plants and veg and plants and flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: two different light cycles really is what
I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you've got all these different tents
and you can have them on different light
[SPEAKER_02]: cycles, different stages of growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you name some other ways that this new
setup is easier for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, 100% for, um, environment wise,
I'm actually really learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, like I said, I've known a little bit
my whole life with like basic reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ball pythons, different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with all those things, you have to
like, they only breathe in a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only breathe with certain light,
like certain time of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of the same thing, but I'm learning,
um, how to provide the perfect atmosphere
[SPEAKER_00]: to where like the light in the,
um, the AC thing, like the 69 pro will
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like engages you through how to
like change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if your lights up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So high and you just watered, then you
should probably turn your intake fan up
[SPEAKER_00]: that day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just to get some air out or
different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, um, I'm able to change that and say,
just work it at the same exact level every
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can keep naming a bunch of different
things, but even with like, um,
I still plan on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like going further down, like my breeding
lane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of different things that
you cannot have a human did at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: like trying to develop pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot have like, um, different,
I have to have it in a whole nother area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fact that I have another light,
another thing and basically a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: nother, you know, grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can take to the other side and,
or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Family members house and still develop my
own grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would never even, I would have thought
maybe a couple of years down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have plans to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to work towards doing that,
but all those things are like dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I actually can't think like,
Oh, I have this project.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least I have the tools.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're here with me or they're with
family members and I can put those tools
[SPEAKER_00]: to work at any time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's kind of amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did not know that was possible.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having that controller that you mentioned,
definitely, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can make things a lot more easier
controlling the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are using any equipment to, to control
like the relative humidity, such as like a
[SPEAKER_02]: humidifier, or I imagine that you had to
use that in Vegas, but now in California
[SPEAKER_02]: are using a dehumidifier now or,
or still humidifier.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let me see if I can actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'll stay here, but I was going to
grab my controller to kind of show,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's kind of been like a 60,
62 humidity and, um, a little bit high
[SPEAKER_00]: seventies or like 75, uh, temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm, I'm chilling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not worried about changing that up
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's solid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the light level at, uh,
eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't tried to push it up to anything
further than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on, uh, week four, maybe by the
end I'll try to push to 10, but still,
[SPEAKER_00]: since I've had evil eights, they're so
strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not tried to push 10 and running
out the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe did tell me he was like, bro,
I'm at 10 from, from jump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're well, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, he said, run on my team,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those lights are super powerful.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Evo series.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the Evo three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Myself, I have two Evo threes and I have
an Evo six.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you mentioned at the Evo eight,
you have a couple of the Evo eights,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, before I moved, I was running now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was running three at one time,
pretty much at eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't realize it was like 3000 watt
lights and like the older building.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like after the second, um, month cycle of
running.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it takes this much light,
but, um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ended up taking away some lights and
keep the same amount of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still checking, like, you know,
the drop off, but, uh, I feel like it was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of the same result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be wrong, but I feel like it was
kind of the same result with the Evo
[SPEAKER_00]: eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're just really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that is a really good light,
powerful light.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know anybody who runs it at a
hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think most people run it like 80%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people run it 50%,
60%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking in flowering stage too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course you can dim it down even
more for the veg stage because you
[SPEAKER_02]: certainly don't need it to be at a hundred
percent when you're in the seedlings,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, you don't want plants,
bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it does make a huge difference having
the optimal lighting, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the lighting that you need for that grow
space in your old space.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had those Vipa Spectra wands and I
don't even think it was completely
[SPEAKER_02]: covering the areas it should have been.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, yeah, no offense to like the
company at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just, they have higher level lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have better, you know, I just was
using the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was being cheap when I offered them like
30, 40 bucks on 150 watt light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanted a couple of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I could stretch them out with
the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't advise any new grower to actually
try to maximize with the minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you're growing with the bare
minimum, you should like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go wild with that minimum space and
minimum equipment instead of like
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was definitely overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned a lot from what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned how to like, you know,
when you're doing your math, I learned how
[SPEAKER_00]: to show my work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might go back and erase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you shouldn't have to go through those
things for like at that speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people will just quit growing for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: How has plant health and yields changed
from your old setup to your new setup?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_00]: My plants are 10 times more healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't really seen any, I haven't seen
many problems besides things that either
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is asking for or things that I'm
lacking on, like a common head problems or
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a big problem with adding in too
much nitrogen sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've had plants in the past get
lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know it was lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, Oh, this plant is so pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is the darkest leafed plant
ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I slowly had to learn and like read
more and watch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was actually lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some plants that are dark
naturally, but that certain color is
[SPEAKER_00]: lockout.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I felt like that was a perfect
thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing your Grove Rome,
the old setup and walking in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: seeing you had some struggling plants
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you, like you mentioned earlier with,
and since then the pictures you show
[SPEAKER_02]: online, Instagram, you could clearly see a
difference in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I hear a lot of people say
that you don't need all this equipment in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to get healthy plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You probably don't, but it helps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps out tremendously having a
controller that's going to automate your
[SPEAKER_02]: environment, for example, or her lighting
that's going to provide the sufficient
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of light for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe not having this top line set up
that you have now, maybe it's not a
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement, but it's certainly helpful in
getting, in getting a better result.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a Walmart board versus a skateboard
requirement, you can still push down the
[SPEAKER_00]: street.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can escape.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm doing flip chicks right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is way better, but I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel like, uh, if I could tell
anybody else with like a, if they were to
[SPEAKER_00]: get like a one 50 watt or anything like
that, get it, use it or use it for veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use it for germ.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even use it past a week or two of
edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not going to like, there's
lights that are literally make your pit do
[SPEAKER_00]: what it should do after a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: After the second set of leaves,
it could pretty much do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use anything like that for
long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's good for germ.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about your daily routine?
[SPEAKER_02]: How has that changed having from basically
no equipment to having top of the line
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a lot more stress list.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's a word or term,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I hand water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a, a thing that I still haven't
figured out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but other than that, I, I feel like I
can leave town for a couple of days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can leave town for like two,
three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially like, you know, growing in
soil, you have a two day in between
[SPEAKER_00]: watering most of the time, especially with
like the medium I'm using.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to water every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I'm in flower, I might have to
water every other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, yeah, I feel like growing in soil
and with the controller to hook it up to
[SPEAKER_00]: wifi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you go to Disneyland and you want to
go to Florida, because it's your family or
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So look at my stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can still see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any body in town, you can have
them go do what you see going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, Oh, this is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, before I was kind of just like
scrambling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt like I was the only one that could
fix any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't go out of town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't like, there's no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like nobody knows my problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody knows what can be fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now it's kind of like, uh,
I don't want to say automated because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's like the new like automated
system, but it helps me control myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've like, I've been saying this time a
lot with my friend and I talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: growing, it's like full control.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to like companies growing autos
or anybody that grows autos, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: personally right now because I really like
the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I want to know how many days of veg I
can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go for a plan just decides to do
what it wants to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know how many, like if,
uh, right now I have one gallons in my
[SPEAKER_00]: tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know that I have this many one
gallons, the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always going to put the bare minimum at
developing a 28, you know, at the lowest
[SPEAKER_01]: 28, um, at the weight of each one gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to, you know, I'm not going
to high up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I know how many I have, I know how many
that can develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then with the auto, you can never really
calculate or predict those things with,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, photo periods and having a system that
is controlled, that word control becomes
[SPEAKER_00]: so much more like you can control every
single thing that's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when it comes to like cutting clones,
you kind of can control how many days the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a little bit of it has helped,
but if you know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can really control it.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The having that controller, like you
mentioned where you can basically go into
[SPEAKER_02]: an app on your phone and be able to not
only see what your conditions are,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you can control the different pieces
of equipment through there as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt the same way when I went to like
the AC infinity system using their app
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of kind of being blind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been so many years without that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is kind of nervous leaving town
because you don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you just hope that your plants are
going to be good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hope that the, the environment
conditions are going to be solid,
[SPEAKER_02]: that the lighting is going to turn on like
it should and turn off like it should,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's definitely a, definitely a
huge game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing I forgot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, before you guys came, I was having a
problem with, um, my lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was using like the old like spin
wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Timers and you know, it happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did it wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was probably high, but, um, I,
uh, while winding back my timer to where
[SPEAKER_00]: somehow it was a couple more hours of
light than it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't turn off or it cut back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, literally things were starting to
revenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything had to be vegged, uh,
everything like every nut.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was wild, but I wasn't able to catch
that because during those times it was
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't going to open that door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, there's no way I don't need to
go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, um, now that I have the controller,
I don't really have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say if you are new to the
controller at all and you're setting up
[SPEAKER_00]: the controller by hand, I don't think
anybody should do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to use the app because there's
like the left and right button sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: will change settings that you don't even
notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your lights might cut back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to change that is in the
app.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to happen to two different people
I've seen on Instagram and I personally
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yep, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that was the thing,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the control over your app.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so much easier to set up the
controller.
[SPEAKER_02]: I completely agree with you on that one
versus trying to do it on the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: controller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking back at your evolution from a
struggling grow room to a high tech
[SPEAKER_02]: operation, what advice would you have for
growers considering a similar upgrade?
[SPEAKER_00]: My personal advice is really think about
what you're going for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really think about if you just like,
there's nothing wrong with people like
[SPEAKER_00]: house plants and different flowers,
all that exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I truly believe that 75% of our
community are men that are afraid to admit
[SPEAKER_00]: that they want them to see something grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some people choose to grow
auto.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, they edge for like a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people, they just like to see
something grow and they don't want to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: no flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that, I don't know,
I feel like we should put more into
[SPEAKER_00]: growing more things than just that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting the experience with other plants
can certainly be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some plants can be treated the same,
but oftentimes there are a little
[SPEAKER_02]: differences here and there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I went from starting growing
medicinal plants, then vegetables,
[SPEAKER_02]: leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started out with peppers, tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I've got trees in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been kind of continuing to move on
and on and on and learn more about the
[SPEAKER_02]: different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely something I enjoy a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that in Vegas?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there are a bunch of plants that,
a bunch of trees that can thrive out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like figs, pomegranate,
citrus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trees actually really thrive out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some apple varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking to get a couple of those
pears.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, yeah, it can be done out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're naming a lot of stuff that I
expected to be such water consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think it was possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, have you ever met John Kohler Kohler?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I'm pronouncing his last
name right, but have you man, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow, grow your greens.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually ran into him at MJ biz con
probably like three or four years ago now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a conversation with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him in person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have quite a few folks here that are
looking for genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're shopping for genetics and they
don't really know what to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been asking folks that have been
coming on the podcast recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: what genetics do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you name maybe the top three strains
that you've grown and what you've liked
[SPEAKER_02]: about them?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say, um, two, I'm going to fill in
pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because they're the first things I
grew that I was like, wow, this is,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is what is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I didn't, um, give them the due
diligence.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably should have gotten,
but it's not genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far, those are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really believe that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're trying to get into growing
like exotic, different things,
[SPEAKER_00]: like different flavor profiles,
then that's somebody you should go to.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking into breeding,
or if you're looking into growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, different things that wasn't like,
aren't exactly in the rules of what,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, uh, the way things should go,
but you're looking for something crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: that nobody is going to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people should go to Masonic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my top three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Masonic smoker, um, desire genetics
and so far those are three good Masonic is
[SPEAKER_00]: so reasonable on price.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes like $10, $25 for like sometimes
40 beans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the other two, they're a little
pricey, but I still think all three are
[SPEAKER_00]: super worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I appreciate you sharing that
information with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's wrap things up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell listeners how they can find
you and what you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_02]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to find me, you can find me
at Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by the seas, um, YouTube, so by the 420
or so by the seas and in the future,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am working on a podcast right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, kind of writing down the pre
scripts or like three questions and
[SPEAKER_00]: reaching out to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like what's the best for my
podcast, which is going to have to do with
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower we all love and, um,
being paranoid, you know, being paranoid
[SPEAKER_00]: and different things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people automatically, like a lot of
people I reach out to, they were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to talk about, um,
like being paranoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be necessarily what
people are thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you might talk about like the
UFOs, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to talk about the paranoia in
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love bringing a bag of soil home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's something we all don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, uh, really diving into
becoming a tester for somebody that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: really represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so many things that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That I feel like are vague and people
should talk about this and we know what he
[SPEAKER_00]: talks about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways to talk about it without
disrespecting people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to seeing what you
come out with in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll definitely have a link to soul
brother's YouTube channel down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: description section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also as a pen to comment, so you can
easily get to it, give him a subscription
[SPEAKER_02]: and want to give a big thanks to the folks
that support on Patreon, patreon.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% of what is donated through Patreon
goes right back on the podcast.
[SPEAKER_02]: The folks being scrolled on the screen
right now are in the producer tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Special thanks to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to know the comments section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: What questions do you have for soul
brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's somebody who has experience going
from basically nothing to having it all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely leave some questions down in
the comment section below.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if he has some time,
I'll pop in there and answer a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you for giving me the chance to
actually talk to everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And talk to you about things I felt like I
wanted to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, this community is something
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked on music in my life,
doing a bunch of different things that
[SPEAKER_00]: involve outside communities that you've
never met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the nicest, most, there's
unsupportive, but 80% more supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: people in this community than any other
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to reach out, ask some
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Chris said, there's the link and or
spot down there where you should come
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, thank you guys and have a good
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much for sharing your journey,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really was eager to hear about how
things have changed since going from where
[SPEAKER_02]: you started to where you are now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really awesome to hear the
success you've been having.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks so much for taking the time
today to share with all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have a good day and hopefully you
and the kiddo could watch some TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Catch in the next episode.
