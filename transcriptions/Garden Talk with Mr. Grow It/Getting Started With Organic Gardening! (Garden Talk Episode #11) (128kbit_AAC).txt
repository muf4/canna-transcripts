[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk, when you
completely saturate your medium and get it
[SPEAKER_00]: to what we call field capacity and Which
is where you can pick it up and squeeze it
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't get maybe but one drop come
off your hand That's how moist your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: should start out the stomata tend to open
right before Sunrise or right before your
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor lights come on so if you can spray
20 to 30 minutes before Sunrise or before
[SPEAKER_00]: your lights turn on the stomata will open
and soak up what you just sprayed on to
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf surface and then you have what's
called a green manure or a green mulch and
[SPEAKER_00]: then that will Decompose in place also and
help boost to the nitrogen in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: the best advice for anybody starting new
on an organic route is Do less you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want to do a bunch more stuff
because you feel like you're not doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot, but do less
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up everybody feel that don't know
me my name is Chris aka mr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grow it and you're tuned into the garden
talk podcast This is episode 11.
[SPEAKER_01]: This episode's guest goes by the name
green goblin 510 He is an organic gardener
[SPEAKER_01]: that grows plants both indoors and
outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: He grows tomatoes leafy greens peppers
Herbs and of course medicinal plants He
[SPEAKER_01]: has a YouTube channel with over 2,000
subscribers and he's part of a live stream
[SPEAKER_01]: that airs every Tuesday on CL TV In this
episode we talk about getting started with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic gardening more specifically We
talk about how he grows his plants with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic inputs If you're watching this on

[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I have rambled on enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into the episode All right,
gree goblin 510, how are you today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty good you good good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about time I get you on this you're
part of the basically part of the CL TV
[SPEAKER_01]: family, right and I see you on their live
stream every single week You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already talked with Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talk with Trey And now it's time to talk
with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for joining me today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a problem So today we're gonna talk
about you know getting started with
[SPEAKER_01]: organic gardening and kind of what you do
in your garden With organic inputs growing
[SPEAKER_01]: organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first before we get into the growth
side of things Can you just tell us a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit about yourself and how you got
into growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I got into growing mainly as a
medical benefit I broke my leg and sprang
[SPEAKER_00]: both my ankles on a trampoline and You
know, I got Some injuries from that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then just from that I got lower back pain
from trying to take care of the lower leg
[SPEAKER_00]: injuries so that helps out a lot and then
I got into growing a lot because My mom
[SPEAKER_00]: also has an autoimmune disease and that
also seems to help her out a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I actually Back in 2006 I broke my
well I tore ligaments in my ankle from a
[SPEAKER_01]: BMX bike accident and I remember whenever
I put my leg down like the blood would
[SPEAKER_01]: just rush down into my leg and it would be
extremely painful swollen and and and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was one of the things that
actually Solved that for me, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it covered in my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So You know, it's kind of one of the
things that helped me over the years and
[SPEAKER_01]: so you have a YouTube channel you We got
ourselves a visitor here Rudely
[SPEAKER_01]: interrupted So you got a YouTube channel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about that
kind of what you do for videos on there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I like to put out DIY like organic
inputs and that you can use in your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and different weekly updates I like to put
out in my you know highlighting different
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in my garden and then just teaching
people as I go and how I like to grow All
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of plants honestly,
I think I've watched every one of your
[SPEAKER_01]: videos except for I think three I missed
very very informative kind of step-by-step
[SPEAKER_01]: DIY type stuff highly recommended I will
leave a link to his channel down in the
[SPEAKER_01]: description section below so you can click
on that and head on over there press the
[SPEAKER_01]: subscribe button on there and and check
out his videos, but he's very very
[SPEAKER_01]: detailed in his videos, which is something
I really like so Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let's talk about organic
gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you typically?
[SPEAKER_00]: use for medium I typically make my own
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been technically reusing my own
medium for around seven or eight years now
[SPEAKER_00]: and just reamending with worm castings and
compost and dry amendments and Reworking
[SPEAKER_00]: that in there and keep using that same
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does it consist of?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was kind of the star was like a peat
based or yeah, it was a peat based okay Do
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what the ratios were on it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the the one third aeration one
third sphagnum and one third compost worm
[SPEAKER_00]: castings that you know What a lot of the
recipes out there on the internet are Got
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what type of compost you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I remember from one of your videos
used a different type of compost compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to what other people use I like using a
mushroom compost because it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more fungly dominated and having that a
little more fungly dominated compost in
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil mix helps the uptake of
phosphorus and potassium Which are key
[SPEAKER_00]: elements later on in the plant's life and
all throughout the plant's life But and
[SPEAKER_01]: then what do you use for aeration?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use rice hulls and Clay pebbles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll make sure of those two the clay
pebbles don't break down as Quickly as the
[SPEAKER_00]: rice hulls and then the rice hulls
actually break down a little bit and add a
[SPEAKER_01]: little silica as they do break down so a
third a third a third of that Do you add
[SPEAKER_01]: any additional amendments on top of that
to begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: that would I would call my base soil and I
would just plant like little seedlings or
[SPEAKER_00]: cuttings and into my base soil and then I
would take a portion of that and also add
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of amendments to that and use that
for Older plants more maturing plants got
[SPEAKER_01]: it know what containers do you usually
start in?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually start in either the solo cups or
Similarly sized nursery pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and then I'm assuming you transplant
into larger containers At what point you
[SPEAKER_01]: usually transplant and then what
containers do you usually kind of go into?
[SPEAKER_00]: I usually go from the solo cup size up to
maybe a one gallon and then maybe to the
[SPEAKER_00]: final home That's mainly for space saving
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your initial mix has compost in it,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has nutrients already in it for the
plant At what point do you do your first
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: about 30 days in actually about two or
three weeks after they're you know
[SPEAKER_00]: sprouted or cutting or whatever they are
I'll transplant them into that one gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: and Inside that one gallon will have some
of that soil that I mixed up with the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments and then I'll transplant it
into the seven gallon and I'll also have
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments in that so throughout that
entire time span it's getting food and at
[SPEAKER_00]: the 30 days I'll top dress.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense and then When you
transplant are you using any mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_01]: fungi in there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you adding in like any worm castings
or anything like that or or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use a Fungi like mycorrhizal
fungi when I have it and if I don't I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just go straight into the soil because
when a living soil There's a lot of it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already there to begin with so adding some
more never hurts But if I don't have it,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just go and transplant It right into
my living soil and then I don't think we
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about what type of containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use you prefer plastic?
[SPEAKER_00]: fabric or what I like a Plastic when
they're in the smaller containers the one
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon solo cup and then fabric for the
rest of the time It's easier to deal with
[SPEAKER_00]: the smaller plants in the plastic
containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense easier to transplant out
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Okay, and then so your first feeding
comes around day 30 at that point You're
[SPEAKER_01]: saying they're in their final containers,
which you use Seven gallon containers as
[SPEAKER_01]: your final containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your first feeding consist of and
how do you apply it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my first feeding consists of
literally a top dress of craft plans build
[SPEAKER_00]: a soil craft plan and It has a good
mixture of a little bit of everything kelp
[SPEAKER_00]: alfalfa meal some rock dust some oyster
shell powder just a nice mix a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of everything and I'll use two tablespoons
per gallon of medium which happens to work
[SPEAKER_00]: out to be about a quarter cup per seven
gallon pot I'll top dress that in and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: rake the amendments in to the top layer of
the soil a little bit and I'll water that
[SPEAKER_00]: in sometimes I'll use a compost tea and
water that in got it We'll talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas in a little bit here Now when
you top dress, do you also do you do any
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch layers or cover crops at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: I I like to use like barley straw as a
mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Heavily endorse the use of cover crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't Use them in my indoor garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Use them more in like my beds outside
and stuff like that I find the cover crops
[SPEAKER_00]: in pots to be a little more work than they
might be worth if You had a decent like a
[SPEAKER_00]: four by eight Living soil bed that might
be worth doing the cover crops as well But
[SPEAKER_00]: in smaller containers, I don't see a huge
benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when do you usually?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you do use cover crops say outdoors
when you do typically planting them
[SPEAKER_00]: typically probably a good month or two
before the Intended crop is planted in
[SPEAKER_01]: that spot and then I assume since the
cover crops growing up You're kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: cutting it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're able to plant in that seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not you know, it's a light seed to
get down to that spot and then you have
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called a green manure or a green
mulch and then that will decompose in
[SPEAKER_00]: place also and help boost the nitrogen in
your soil so often called chop and drop
[SPEAKER_01]: technique is that Kind of what you're
referring to there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so you're chopping it down putting
it right down as a mulch layer on top Do
[SPEAKER_01]: you put any you said barley straw?
[SPEAKER_01]: I use barley straw as well Do you put that
over?
[SPEAKER_00]: That green layer at all or no If I'm using
them in combination I'll lay the cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop seed down first and make sure You
know that's nice and watered in and
[SPEAKER_00]: whatnot and then I'll lay the barley straw
over top of it and they'll grow up in
[SPEAKER_00]: between The barley straw and it creates a
nice like mat of protection on your soil
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing something similar to that
and yeah, it's been working out pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: well for sure Alright, let's take a step
back and talk about IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: So integrated pest management Is there
anything that you do in order to prevent
[SPEAKER_01]: pests from getting into your garden?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well other than doing a weekly IPM spray
of like essential oils or a Tweetment
[SPEAKER_00]: enzyme cleaner or even just water and just
spraying your plants down with water Just
[SPEAKER_00]: be intelligent of not going out for a hike
and then going to visit the plants You
[SPEAKER_00]: know just things like that Having a very
clean garden area don't have any spots for
[SPEAKER_00]: pests to hide and it's a lot easier to
keep them from attacking whatever plants
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to keep protected and then
another thing I like to do is I'll plant
[SPEAKER_00]: different bait plants per se around my
property and the the The insects will like
[SPEAKER_00]: to attack those plants more and stay away
from the plants that I would like to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: around What do you use for bait plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that that's kind of the hard thing
to say for to recommend to people because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be different for everybody's
different location Whether you're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: more northern climate or a southern
climate or you know a more desert arid
[SPEAKER_00]: climate but honestly if you want to find
out the best one for your area is to Go
[SPEAKER_00]: take a hike and look at ones that are
being attacked and you'll find the ones in
[SPEAKER_00]: your areas that will be great bait plants
that you could plant around your area and
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a there's an app that I like to
use on my phone I think it's called
[SPEAKER_00]: naturalist and you can take a photo of
whatever Plant you're looking at and it
[SPEAKER_00]: will try to cross-check it against a bunch
of different plants in the world and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gets pretty close and it'll you can
identify plant relatively easily By doing
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of research and you can use
that plant in your area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense So for essential oil
spray that you use What do you typically
[SPEAKER_01]: use for essential oils and you said you
apply them on a weekly basis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, every week I like to do a spray and I
like to alternate it from the essential
[SPEAKER_00]: oil to maybe the Tweetment enzyme to maybe
water to maybe neem and I'll just keep
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating them every week just to make sure
that if any pests happen to come along
[SPEAKER_00]: they They get nipped in the bud right
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: The essential oil blend is I believe it's
clove Garlic, it's a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the essential oil blend from build a
soil it just happens to be the easiest way
[SPEAKER_00]: to go about it because they Blended it all
together and gave it to you in a bottle
[SPEAKER_00]: off, you know At a fair price and then
otherwise I could go out and buy all the
[SPEAKER_00]: separate ones and mix them myself,
but It would get a little expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have more but I'd rather support a
good company and Get their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely builds a soil is doing great
over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got so much good information good
products They're definitely kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: leading the way when it comes to growing
organically and teaching others how to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow organically So definitely I'm loving
this new series over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's IPM now How about foliar
feedings your any type of?
[SPEAKER_00]: foliar feeds throughout the grow every
couple of weeks, I like to do a foliar
[SPEAKER_00]: feed that consists of a full power fulvic
acid and a little bit of kelp meal and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll soak that in a bucket and then for
maybe 20 or 30 minutes a tablespoon of
[SPEAKER_00]: kelp meal and that humic acid and Then if
your sprayer can't handle it, you can
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it through a little bit of a coffee
filter or Strain it out a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the kelp meal might clog up
your sprayer and filter that out and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: spray it on my plants and they love it the
kelp meal has lots of enzymes and minerals
[SPEAKER_00]: in it and They the humic acid helps
release those enzymes and minerals I've
[SPEAKER_01]: never used kelp as a foliar, but I have
used it as a top dressing And also kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kelps included in recharge as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of like a soil drench I have
to try it as a foliar now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched your video on foliar feeding you
have a very in-depth video and I'll link
[SPEAKER_01]: it down in the description section below
so people know about this but a Lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: good information very detailed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we talk a little bit about when to
spray?
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that was very interesting about
you talked about the stomata openings and
[SPEAKER_00]: the ideal time to spray your plants Yeah,
the the stomata tend to open right before
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunrise or right before your indoor lights
come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can spray 20 to 30 minutes
before sunrise or before your lights turn
[SPEAKER_00]: on the stomata will open and soak up what
you just sprayed on to the leaf surface
[SPEAKER_00]: and It'll be a more effective foliar feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 30 minutes before now,
I know some people are probably watching
[SPEAKER_01]: this probably gonna be a little bit
concerned that You know with droplets
[SPEAKER_01]: being left on the plant The light comes on
that high-intensity light it could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially kind of burn your plants due
to the the droplets kind of acting as a
[SPEAKER_01]: Magnifying lens and I think in your video
you had mentioned if you're doing a 20 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 minutes prior And you have the
oscillating fans on the plant should very
[SPEAKER_01]: well be dry at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm They should be mostly dry and at
least not no more having the water drops
[SPEAKER_00]: on the leaf surface They may still be wet
a little bit, but the big drops causing
[SPEAKER_00]: the magnifying glass type effect should be
gone also, if you use your aloe or yucca
[SPEAKER_00]: In there those are wetting agents and it
will actually help prevent some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: dots from even forming It'll just make a
nice smooth coating over the leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome I've been using yucca a lot
lately having my reservoirs just in my my
[SPEAKER_01]: spray bottles that I use to spray the top
of the medium and then also mixing it in
[SPEAKER_01]: with just Any soil drench that I use this
stuff's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked a little bit of aloe I know on
your channel you use a lot aloe in a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of different ways Can you explain some of
the ways that you use aloe?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use aloe for and my foliar sprays for
cloning as a cloning gel as a wetting
[SPEAKER_00]: agent for watering And for pretty much
anything, you know, if I get a cut or a
[SPEAKER_00]: nick or bruise in the garden I'll use it
right then and there and it's a great I
[SPEAKER_00]: have like three or four of them and my
Garden and I just cut little pieces off
[SPEAKER_00]: every so often when I need to use them and
Then good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to buy cloning gels or
wetting agents as much Yucca is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more powerful of a wetting agent than
aloe but aloe also has Saperons and
[SPEAKER_00]: different enzymes in it that help the
plant turn on its own defense systems
[SPEAKER_00]: against pests and diseases Even though
there isn't a pest and disease around So I
[SPEAKER_00]: also like using that as a in my soil
drenches or foliar sprays To help the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants just enact their defenses a little
bit early before they run in any problems
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't used aloe yet, but after
watching your videos on it and how you use
[SPEAKER_01]: it step-by-step I'm definitely have to try
that in the future because it's a common
[SPEAKER_01]: house plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: it's something that a lot of people just
keep around their house and You know being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have that in your house and then
cut off a piece to use for For rooting or
[SPEAKER_01]: as a foliar spray or whatever it can be
beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something I'm definitely gonna
best practice I'm gonna shamelessly steal
[SPEAKER_01]: from you and incorporate to my garden and
that's all point of this this podcast
[SPEAKER_01]: really is to Talk to girls from all over
the world all different styles of growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and see what they do in their garden and
that's their successful doing So people
[SPEAKER_01]: listening can incorporate in their
gardens, you know trying out these
[SPEAKER_01]: different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be really fun to try new things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Again, thanks for for sharing tips like
that because it's helpful for not only me,
[SPEAKER_01]: but everybody tuned into this So,
oh yeah, not a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to pass the tips along Alright,
so let's take a step back to a feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've done your feeding in the veg stage
How long do you typically veg your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: for do you do any other feedings in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Veg or are you flipping a flower and then
doing more feedings?
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually I'll just do that one feeding in
veg veg might be Anywhere from a month to
[SPEAKER_00]: a month and a half depending on the
cultivar Some like to be a little squatty
[SPEAKER_00]: and slow slower than the others and some
like to shoot up and grow a little faster
[SPEAKER_00]: than the others but Yeah, usually it's
about a month a month and a half and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: put them into flower about two weeks into
flower I'll use a compost tea and That's
[SPEAKER_00]: usually about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might do a top dress right when I do
that compost tea another Top dress
[SPEAKER_00]: depending it if it was the month and a
half I might do another top dress and the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea when I flip Other than that
it's just water from the nun So I assume
[SPEAKER_01]: the other top dress is gonna be craft
blend more of the craft blend as a top
[SPEAKER_00]: dress same ratio as before You know,
maybe a little bit of insect for us mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and then for your teas What does
that consist of?
[SPEAKER_00]: Worm castings and a good source of compost
where that be a mushroom compost or a
[SPEAKER_00]: regular, you know thermal compost and then
I'll use a cup of the build a soil a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of the humic acid and a little
bit of the aloe and Bubble that up for 24
[SPEAKER_00]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you usually do a Five gallon bucket
like what's your what's your ratios for
[SPEAKER_00]: that five gallon bucket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and then what do you do use?
[SPEAKER_00]: for a food source in your teas,
I like to use it as a product from
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida, it's a Lord of the raw sugarcane
crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to use that it's a little more
easier to measure out and put into the
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea and it's a I find it's a
little bit more of a simpler sugar for the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes to eat they don't have to work
through the molasses type structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses, you know, that's the sticky
runny ness of it and it's much it like
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes an homogenized mixture so that the
microbes can eat it easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't use molasses at all in your
garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use any type of sugars as a soil
drench at all throughout the grow or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: only really sugars in your teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in the teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now do you use any microbial inoculants
throughout the grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely like a product Recharge is a
great product and then also There's a
[SPEAKER_00]: product I use called Dr. Earth flower girl
that has amendments in it and it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculated with mycorrhizal fungi and a
few bacteria and when I mix my soil I use
[SPEAKER_00]: a cup of that along with the craft blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you using them at all like there's a
soil drench throughout the grow at all or
[SPEAKER_01]: no?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just that initial inoculation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the compost tea does give them a
boost when I do that I do maybe two
[SPEAKER_00]: compost teas the entire grow cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you monitor I know this is a question
that I was gonna say you might laugh at me
[SPEAKER_01]: for asking but it's a common question for
beginners especially the ones that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just starting growing organically is do
you monitor the PPM or EC at all or no?
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC is kind of alright to monitor as an
organic grower because that tells you how
[SPEAKER_00]: active your microbial life is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that can give you some indication of
how good your soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that number is not completely useless
but the PPM number I don't use because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's inorganic and organic you know
solids that are coming out of a runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: test and we don't you can't determine what
ones are which with that PPM meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it and are you doing in order to check
the EC are you doing like a slurry test or
[SPEAKER_01]: are you doing a runoff test or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a nice probe test from Hanna
instruments that you can literally just
[SPEAKER_00]: put in your soil and it will do perform an
EC test for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what about pH?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you monitor the pH at all either in
your nutrient solution prior to giving to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant or any type of like slower your
runoff pH test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while I do test my pH and
my coming off my tap to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's you know around the same I do have it
filtered with an activated carbon filter
[SPEAKER_00]: that I replace frequently but I do test
the pH coming from the city of Minnesota
[SPEAKER_00]: because once in a while it does change and
I might have to correct it because it will
[SPEAKER_00]: go too far one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that I don't monitor the pH a
whole lot in my soil unless I'm running
[SPEAKER_00]: into issues I might actually do a pH test
for my soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay so switching over to water are you
using tap water that's filtered now is
[SPEAKER_01]: your filter also taking out like any
chlorine or chloramine at all or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to let it sit out for an additional
and people just let it sit out for like 24
[SPEAKER_01]: hours or something like that so the
chlorine will dissipate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I do have the the activated
carbon filter is that it is a it does
[SPEAKER_00]: filter out the chlorine and some of the
chloramines not every filter not any
[SPEAKER_00]: filter will get all of the chloramines
unless you're doing RO but cutting it down
[SPEAKER_00]: to acceptable levels of parts per billion
per billion not million is good enough for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now watering is one of those things when
it comes to organics it could be a little
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky right it's easy to overwater your
plants when it comes to it is there any
[SPEAKER_01]: can you tell us like how you do your
watering you know are you using a pitcher
[SPEAKER_01]: to dump it all in there are you using a
sprayer and slowly spraying or how exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: do you water and when do you know when to
how do you know when to water?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the smaller plants I do like to use a
sprayer to water them in the solo cups and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe even the one gallons because it's a
little bit more accurate of measurement of
[SPEAKER_00]: how much water you are giving them on the
seven gallon ones I do use like a pitcher
[SPEAKER_00]: per se that's a one gallon pitcher and it
happens to be that most the time I can use
[SPEAKER_00]: that entire gallon for that seven gallon
pot so it works out quite well when I know
[SPEAKER_00]: when I need to water is I tell by how the
pot feels how the weight feels of the pot
[SPEAKER_00]: and I know it's kind of a vague answer for
a lot of beginners but when you completely
[SPEAKER_00]: saturate your medium and get it to what we
call field capacity and which is where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can pick it up and squeeze it and you
don't get maybe but one drop come off your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand that's how that's how moist your soil
should start out and be and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: should keep it around that moisture level
while allowing it to maybe drop and wait a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit you can tell by picking it up
and then okay it's a little bit lighter
[SPEAKER_01]: spray a little bit more water in there
okay and then in between waterings you
[SPEAKER_01]: know soil will dry off kind of from the
top down in a sense so that top layer is
[SPEAKER_01]: drying out you know one of the first
things to dry out you know of course it
[SPEAKER_01]: depends on grow pot if you have the the
fabric pots it might actually dry out from
[SPEAKER_01]: the sides right are you spraying with a
sprayer at all the top of the medium in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to kind of keep that moist in
between waterings and how if you do how
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently do you do that in the one
gallons and solos probably once a day I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: spray a little bit of water in there just
to keep the top and the sides moist and by
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of water I mean literally
like two seconds per pot I'll spray some
[SPEAKER_00]: water in there and then on the larger pots
I have the good mulch layer that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about earlier which helps and they
need water nearly every day in that stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of their life anyways so I'm watering
nearly every day anyway to keep it moist
[SPEAKER_01]: now what do you do for plant training so
as the plants growing you know I have seen
[SPEAKER_01]: your channel I kind of know what you do
for plant training not sure if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: changed up since you created that video
but can you talk about what you typically
[SPEAKER_00]: do for plant training typically I might
top a plant maybe one time depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cultivar other than that I like to
low-stress train everything out to get
[SPEAKER_00]: some nice branching happening and then
build some bamboo cages around them so
[SPEAKER_00]: they can be supported and then you know
later stages of life yeah the bamboo cages
[SPEAKER_01]: is what I I saw on your channel I thought
that was pretty cool technique for keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: things upright you know because some of
these cultivars I mean geez they get so
[SPEAKER_01]: flopping all over the place towards the
end of flowering because the buds is so so
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy and that those bamboo style that you
did would definitely help with that so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's good stuff there now what about
lighting what do you typically use for
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting or what do you have for lighting
in your garden right now right now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: mostly LED and I still have two HPS lists
left most of my LEDs are HLG LEDs I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: 650 DIY kit in which I put together over
on my channel and then I also have a 480
[SPEAKER_00]: watt one of their older ones that's a 550
v2 and I also have a their 300 watt
[SPEAKER_01]: version as well nice definitely have some
quality lights over there I had the 100 v2
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while grew a plant with that I was
super satisfied with that they've got some
[SPEAKER_01]: really good products over there now for
light distance do you have a PAR meter are
[SPEAKER_01]: you dialing in your light distance or a
PAR meter are you just going by the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer's recommendation or what for
the longest I did not have a PAR meter and
[SPEAKER_00]: I just went by you know how the plants are
reacting in the manufacturer's
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendation but now I do have a PAR
meter so I can kind of dial it in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: closer than just watching the plants and
using the manufacturer's recommendations
[SPEAKER_00]: but by getting a PAR meter I did find out
that I was pretty close without it so that
[SPEAKER_00]: was nice to see as well which PAR meter
are you using I have the Apogee M500 okay
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I got that one I also have the MQ620
I know the 620 is kind of the extended
[SPEAKER_01]: range one it's good for LEDs the 500 is
just that what 400 to 700 nanometer range
[SPEAKER_00]: the blue one the blue sensor of the Apogee
super useful to have one I mean they're
[SPEAKER_01]: super expensive right 500 plus dollars for
a good PAR meter but being able to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know for energy consumption purposes you
can dim down your light and get it closer
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you have that PAR meter you can
kind of ensure that you're not giving your
[SPEAKER_01]: plants too much light so I typically aim
for like 200 to 400 PPFD in seedling stage
[SPEAKER_01]: clones and mother plants 400 to 600 for
veg 600 to 900 for flower and then if I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: supplementing co2 I go get a little bit
higher than that maybe around a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: or so maybe yeah do you monitor what do
you typically aim for there I try to aim
[SPEAKER_00]: for right around 900 to a thousand during
flower and same numbers for you know
[SPEAKER_00]: seedlings and veg I don't supplement co2
so I can't really push it too much further
[SPEAKER_01]: than that I was gonna ask if you
supplement co2 so you don't use any of
[SPEAKER_01]: those co2 bags any canisters no tanks
nothing like that just kind of relying on
[SPEAKER_00]: the air exchange the air exchange and I do
I do grow in a basement and I do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of co2 sensors down here and at all
times it's around 800 ppm so I mean I
[SPEAKER_00]: could supplement to get a couple more
hundred ppm of co2 down here and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: push the plants a little harder but I'm
good with what I get 800 is not bad at all
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean what is it like 400 is natural co2
loads around there I know it's always
[SPEAKER_01]: changing but right now it's about 400 so
being at 800 that's that's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: better what co2 monitors do you use I
actually put them together myself I use a
[SPEAKER_00]: Raspberry Pi and I make a whole bunch of
sensors and have those sensors report back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the Raspberry Pi I'm a little bit of a
geek in that nature and you know I like to
[SPEAKER_00]: do that myself and save a little bit of
money in the long run too that's awesome I
[SPEAKER_01]: have the co2 monitor by co2 meter and it's
like this round meter it's like pretty big
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wish they had one that would you
could just hang I mean they do have one I
[SPEAKER_01]: know Trollmaster hasn't has one we can
just kind of hang down so you can get it
[SPEAKER_01]: within the canopy reading but like I had
this big round thing that I can't like
[SPEAKER_01]: shove into my canopy right now I feel like
that's one thing that's lacking right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is good co2 meters especially one that
could link to your smartphone right I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even know if one exists for that I
had to make one he had to make one right
[SPEAKER_01]: so I hope to see that that come out from
some of these companies in the future cool
[SPEAKER_00]: so what temperature do you usually aim for
I'm usually 76 degrees to up to 83 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: and and the flower room okay that's flower
do you do anything different for veg or
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling or about the same they're about
the same all the heat and temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming out of the flower room I
just pour onto the veg room and keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: warm and then and any excess heat from
there I'll pull from the veg out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: house so as far as air exchange are you
pumping all of the air from the flower
[SPEAKER_01]: room over to your veg room and then kind
of like passively and taking into your
[SPEAKER_01]: flower room and then you have like another
inline fan in your veg room that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanging air from there or what kind of
yeah I have an intake fan on my flower
[SPEAKER_00]: room taking in fresh air and then I have
an output fan from the flower room blowing
[SPEAKER_00]: all the high air onto the veg area and
then I have yet another inline fan pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: air out of the veg area out of the house
and there's around 24-7 the one pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the house is on a temperature
setting now how about humidity it's
[SPEAKER_01]: another thing that a lot of people monitor
throughout the grow what do you typically
[SPEAKER_00]: aim for humidity and the different stages
of growth I'm usually at like 60 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: and veg maybe a little higher sometimes if
I do a foliar spray it'll be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: higher obviously for a little bit I'm
around the same in flower 55 to 60 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity and flower now what about air
circulation so I mean humidity temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: there can be pockets of high humidity
temperature so air circulation is huge do
[SPEAKER_01]: you have multiple fans in your grow
environment where do you typically kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: place them within your environment I like
depending on the model of fans some some
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little stronger than others but I
like to place them around every four feet
[SPEAKER_00]: so around every four feet whether that's
one for a four by four area or two for a
[SPEAKER_00]: four by eight section but around every
four feet I like to use a fan and keep it
[SPEAKER_00]: on low I always keep it on low because I
like the air movement and I like to plant
[SPEAKER_00]: leafs to flutter a little bit but I don't
want to push them too hard yeah that
[SPEAKER_01]: constant wind especially when you have a
fan blowing directly under the plan you'll
[SPEAKER_01]: see wind burn right the outer edges of the
leaf will kind of brown up and curl down
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had wind burn so many times it's so
easy with some of these fans because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so strong to get wind burn so
that's a good tip to have it on low all
[SPEAKER_01]: right so we covered a lot in this episode
is there anything else that you can think
[SPEAKER_01]: of that you kind of wanted to talk about
in this episode I mean if I were going to
[SPEAKER_00]: add co2 supplementation in my flower room
I would start growing different mushrooms
[SPEAKER_00]: different gourmet mushrooms in my flower
room and that way I get another product
[SPEAKER_00]: from it and I could you know eat it and
cook with the mushrooms and I'd also get
[SPEAKER_00]: the co2 from it and that way you get kind
of the best of both worlds absolutely do
[SPEAKER_01]: you have any other tips or tricks for
those that are maybe watching this and
[SPEAKER_01]: just starting the organic route what
advice do you have for them the best
[SPEAKER_00]: advice for anybody starting new on an
organic route is do less you're gonna want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do a bunch more stuff because you feel
like you're not doing a whole lot but do
[SPEAKER_00]: less watch the plant do a little bit of
training you don't have to do a lot when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're growing organic and you have a soil
set up so don't try to do too much awesome
[SPEAKER_01]: advice really really good advice there for
sure so how can the listeners find you and
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you have upcoming in the future
you can find me on YouTube at Green Goblin
[SPEAKER_00]: 510 also on Instagram Green Goblin 510 I
got weekly update videos coming I got a
[SPEAKER_00]: new Mars tent and a FC 4800 that I'm gonna
be doing a series in I'm growing afford
[SPEAKER_00]: primal punches in there and come check out
the series awesome once again I will link
[SPEAKER_01]: Green Goblin channel down in the
description section below and also link a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple videos that relate to what we
talked about today I know for the Foley
[SPEAKER_01]: feeding is one of them I think you might
have a video directly on aloe I can link
[SPEAKER_01]: that down below as well but ton of good
information on his channel feel free to
