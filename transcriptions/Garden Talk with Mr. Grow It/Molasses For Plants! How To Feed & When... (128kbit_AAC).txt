[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten questions in the past what
growers ask does molasses burn your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or can it burn your plants and the answer
to that is
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up everybody feed that don't know
me my name is Chris aka mr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grow it and welcome to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about molasses Particularly
incorporating molasses into your garden
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been growing for a little over 10
years now and actually just started
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporating molasses in my garden about
two years ago and molasses It's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient that you're feeding your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a sugar that you're feeding
the soil Specifically the microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are living in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: This video isn't meant to be everything
there is to know about molasses It's meant
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you a general overview of how to
incorporate molasses into your garden in
[SPEAKER_00]: this video I'm going to talk about what is
molasses talk about the different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses Sulfur versus unsulfur then I'll
get into the dosage and when to feed
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses So first off what is molasses
molasses is a dark substance that's made
[SPEAKER_00]: during the sugar refinement process sugar
cane or sugar beet juice is Boiled down
[SPEAKER_00]: into a syrup once the sugar crystals are
extracted the syrup that remains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's molasses There are several
different types of molasses They vary in
[SPEAKER_00]: both sweetness as well as the way that
they are extracted Not all types of
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses is actually suitable for your
garden some molasses is very low quality
[SPEAKER_00]: It contains additives and preservatives
that you don't want your garden if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to incorporate molasses in your
garden Make sure it's organic molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about the different types of
molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They range in color from lighter To darker
to black strap molasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use black strap molasses It's
denser and thicker than the other types
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that I use black strap
molasses is because it has the highest
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration of vitamins Micro and macro
elements.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually have the type of molasses that
I use right here organic black strap
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses Unsulfured and this contains
calcium iron and potassium as well sulfur
[SPEAKER_00]: versus unsulfured Like I just mentioned I
use unsulfured molasses some molasses made
[SPEAKER_00]: from sugar cane Can have sulfur dioxide
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's called sulfur and the
sulfur dioxide acts as a preservative to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it fresh However, it does have a
negative effect particularly when using it
[SPEAKER_00]: in your garden sulfur dioxide It actually
kills off the microorganisms in the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't want to kill off the
beneficial microorganisms in the soil We
[SPEAKER_00]: very much want to keep them alive So if
you are going to incorporate molasses into
[SPEAKER_00]: your garden, make sure it's unsulfured And
like I said before organic now as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage there are various opinions On what
the dosage should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally use one tablespoon of
molasses per gallon of water That's what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard from Oakster Dam University,
but I do know growers that go on the
[SPEAKER_00]: lighter side Down as low as one teaspoon
of molasses per gallon of water So
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhere in that range is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've gotten questions in the past What
growers ask does molasses burn your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or can it burn your plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer to that is no because
again, it's not a nutrient that your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is uptaking It's a sugar that's being fed
to the microorganisms in the soil Now when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're mixing molasses into water the
thicker molasses can be difficult to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: into the water First of all, make sure
you're using dechlorinated water pH the
[SPEAKER_00]: water and then what I usually do is I'll
take out I'll scoop out about a pint of
[SPEAKER_00]: water out of that gallon I'll actually put
it onto the stove and warm up that not to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point of boiling but just a little bit
warmer then I'll mix into the molasses to
[SPEAKER_00]: that warmed up water and Then I'll mix in
that warmed up water with molasses into
[SPEAKER_00]: the remaining water So yeah warming up the
water a little bit just helps the molasses
[SPEAKER_00]: Mix in a little better.
[SPEAKER_00]: When should you feed molasses?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing that there's various
opinions on I've personally experienced to
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding molasses in different stages of
growth seedling stage veg stage I've fed
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses during those time periods plants
were happy, but I feel like flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: stage is most beneficial This is just my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there are growers out there that
would disagree with me Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's safe to use molasses at any point of
the grow some growers like to flush their
[SPEAKER_00]: plant at the end of the grow You can use
molasses during that flush period Whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it be a one week flush two week flush or
whatever I'd love to know do you use
[SPEAKER_00]: molasses in your grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: If so, when do you use it and at what
dosage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comment section
below for those of you brand new to
[SPEAKER_00]: growing I did write a book specifically
for beginners.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's geared towards indoor growing and
covers growing in soil and in cocoa core
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll leave a link to where you can buy my
book down in the description section below
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll leave it at that Thank you so
much for watching and until next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace
