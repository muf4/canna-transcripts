[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a fabric pot situation that doesn't
have that living soil liner, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring drippers or emitters, we want to
bring them further out towards the edge of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot, generally, so that we can keep
that edge more consistently hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the soil moisture dries out,
it dries out this ceramic tip just a bit,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that pulls some of the water that's
inside down into the ceramic itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates a negative hydrostatic
pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want that nice even watering
coverage and maintaining that upper level
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil very, very moist and consistent,
three drippers is a good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solution to that is peck acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a product called Drip Clean that's
like super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, using that like as directed on the
bottles, that'll take care of all those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening is the plant is going and
grabbing the valve, the water control
[SPEAKER_00]: valve, and now the plant's in control of
how it gets watered and when it gets
[SPEAKER_00]: watered.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_01]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is episode number 50, 50 episodes
deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super thankful to all of you who have
tuned into these episodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep them going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely going to keep producing these
episodes because many of you have made it
[SPEAKER_01]: clear that you want these episodes to
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did this on episode 25 as well,
but I think it's important for me to
[SPEAKER_01]: reiterate my vision for this podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: My vision for this podcast is to talk to
growers from all over the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: both beginners and experts, and seek to
learn more about what they know about
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to judge people for the way
that they grow, and this isn't a debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm simply seeking to learn more about the
guest and what they know about gardening
[SPEAKER_01]: and how they do things in their garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: My vision is for these conversations to
not only just help me expand my knowledge,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you, the listener's knowledge too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once again, thank you to all of you who
are riding along with me on this journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I truly appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to know who is your favorite
guest on this podcast so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me know down in the comment section
below.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, I interview Michael Box
from Sustainable Village.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has been gardening for over 22 years
and he specializes in plant irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode, he talks about the
different methods of auto watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also gets into his recommendations for
different size containers.

[SPEAKER_01]: And we are back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I am joined with Michael Box from
Sustainable Village.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good to be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Glad that you decided to come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know each other from MJ BizCon,
actually, we met.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was like three years,
two, three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're out there with Chris there
that one time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chris from Happy Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's actually on episode three of this
Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, excellent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been working with Chris for a
long time too.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's kind of a friendly company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know all about irrigation,
and that's what we're going to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, I think most of my audience is
probably home growers, certainly do have
[SPEAKER_01]: folks on the commercial side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think more of them are more indoor
versus outdoor, but I'm sure we'll talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about things that are relevant towards
everybody now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I wanted to get over in
this episode would be the different common
[SPEAKER_01]: container sizes and how the best way to
irrigate them is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a lot of folks are hand watering
right now, but they're interested in
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going to the automated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll go over what the different
automated systems are, the different
[SPEAKER_01]: options for the different container sizes,
so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it should be valuable on that aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But first, before we get into that,
can you give us an introduction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us a little bit about yourself and
how you got into gardening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I currently work for Sustainable
Village.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're based out of Boulder, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Sustainable Village has been
around for about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been here in this role as the lead
designer and a bunch of other things for
[SPEAKER_00]: probably four years now, and kind of been
friends with the company here for a while
[SPEAKER_00]: and donor for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as my own personal background,
I got into working on organic farms as a
[SPEAKER_00]: teenager back in Pennsylvania where I grew
up, working on organic farms back there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I moved out to Colorado in 2000,
I was involved with the local farm scene
[SPEAKER_00]: here quite a bit and the permaculture
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It did permaculture design certification
about 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've run a market garden here in Boulder
County and the CSA program and a farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: market stand as part of the farmers
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just that's some of the
background I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just always been an avid gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, I've done it in commercial
settings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in Colorado here for like the
last 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some newer industries,
and I've been involved with those as well
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been really heavily involved in
those industries to be particular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's a real, real brief
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throughout all that time, I've always been
very, very interested in irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like rivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like moving water in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a theme in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've always been involved in
irrigation design and installation and
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of run my own install design
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then being able to be here at
Sustainable Village for the last while,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been able to take a lot of... Well,
so at Sustainable Village here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we sell blue mats, which we can get into
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are these moisture sensing
valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're ceramic carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we can dive into those and talk
about how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's been really cool here is to
take some of the designs and the
[SPEAKER_00]: strategies people were using.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, you know, customers were figuring
it out on their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was R&D happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was R &D happening in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to take those ideas and really
expand them into commercial settings or
[SPEAKER_00]: just really easily... Very modular,
easy to replicate systems for the home
[SPEAKER_00]: growers that can easily expand into a
large, like a medium system to a very
[SPEAKER_00]: large system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from there, we've kind of really
branched off the last few years in
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing big ag projects now,
you know, 100 acre farms, that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not using blue mats for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're more traditional drip irrigation or
even some high powered overhead watering
[SPEAKER_00]: in certain circumstances.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, it's been a real journey of
learning and understanding and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: coming to know the whole irrigation
industry and world for the last couple
[SPEAKER_00]: decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, just speaking with you in
person, I could tell that you have a ton
[SPEAKER_01]: of knowledge in regards to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like clearly a passion for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way you explain it, it just makes
things fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the way you get to design different
ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just sounds so fun to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lots of ways to do different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about finding the most
simple, you know, cheapest way to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's a fun puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about grow pots first before
we actually dive into the different sizes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So plastic grow pots versus fabric grow
pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us specifically how it
impacts in regards to irrigation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's not a lot of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, most of the work we do with
blue mats is in containers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, like you said, we're in,
you know, round pots, plastic pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery pots, that kind of stuff,
or fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also in all kinds of different
raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real common, you know,
container growing for indoor gardening or
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse gardening and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People doing large raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a big, well, if we looked at
the round pots kind of thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's one where there's a lot of plastic
pots in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fabric pots in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's the product of
grassroots, you know, the grassroots
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of a pretty good proponent of
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a fabric pot with a non-permeable
liner that, you know, that's about eight
[SPEAKER_00]: or ten inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives a, like, non-breathable layer
on the upper part of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so one of the big problems we
see with irrigating fabric pots in general
[SPEAKER_00]: is they dry out kind of in an uneven way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The edges, like the couple inches near the
edge of the fabric, tend to dry out much
[SPEAKER_00]: faster than the rest of the soil mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots tend not to colonize that outer
edge as densely as they would even in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic pot where moisture is able to be
held right up to the edge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fabric pots are actually,
but they're also very handy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're lightweight.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ship them really easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can kind of reuse them pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's, again, we come back to those
grassroots pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like those for being able to hold
moisture right up to the edge of the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not but still have kind of a lot of
convenience of a fabric pot or
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the fabric raised beds
when we see those because they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can do big ones and, you know,
set them up really quickly without a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of carpentry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so really, I guess the thing to
think about is, you know, if we're in a
[SPEAKER_00]: raised bed, or sorry, in a fabric pot
situation that doesn't have that living
[SPEAKER_00]: soil liner, we want to bring our water
distribution, whatever drippers or
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters, we want to bring them further
out towards the edge of the pot generally
[SPEAKER_00]: so that we can keep that edge more
consistently hydrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, I mean, not a ton of
difference as far as how we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, if we're looking at a five-gallon
pot, it's really not going to be that much
[SPEAKER_00]: different between a plastic nursery pot or
a fabric pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, that's good to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's go over some of these grill pot
sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll start with just a one-gallon pot,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have folks that are using just
one-gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they just have one pot and one plant
and one pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you say the optimal way to
irrigate that would be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would it be like a blue mat classic?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what if they were to have like
multiple one-gallon pots?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just an individual one versus a
multiple ones.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think in order to answer that,
I just want to explain blue mats a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they are and how they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they are is they're moisture
sensing valves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I have one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just pulled it out of a plant,
so it's got some dirt on it and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, they have a screw cap here,
so they're empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get them like this, they have
this silicon line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a three-millimeter silicon line that
goes through the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have this little brown dial on the
top as well, and that kind of helps you
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust moisture content.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially what you do with these is
you fill them with water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little process for that and seal
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they have a sealed, there's a
sealed cone full of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this whole cone is buried in the
soil right up to the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the ceramic tip, the ceramic tip
of the cone is completely buried and
[SPEAKER_00]: seated snugly into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens actually is we,
so we charge one end of this line with a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one end of this water line will be a
constant, anywhere between about two and
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 PSI is the range we want to work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's 24 hours a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a pressurized line all the way up
to the point where the tube passes through
[SPEAKER_00]: the carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the carrot's also a valve,
and it's controlled by the soil moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the soil moisture dries out,
it dries out this ceramic tip just a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pulls some of the water that's
inside down into the ceramic itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: which creates a negative hydrostatic
pressure, negative water pressure inside
[SPEAKER_00]: the cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that pulls against the little membrane
here, which opens a valve in the top and
[SPEAKER_00]: allows water to flow through that tube and
then drip out the other end of that tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can either have that drip out
directly out of this tube into the pot or
[SPEAKER_00]: through a series of distribution drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we have a really cool soaker hose
material called Blue Soak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made out of medical grade Tyvek.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really pretty durable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You treat it right and it gives very,
very even slow water distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can do up to a couple hundred feet
of that downstream of one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to answer your question about the best
way to irrigate a one gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: the other type of blue mat product there
is that you mentioned is the classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have some here in the plants here in my
office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what these are, let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are a little different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can see this here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are, they just have a hose
connected right to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't pass through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one end of this tube has like a weight
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that weighted tube just dropped into a
pitcher of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the cone itself gets buried in
the soil here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it actually just siphons water up from
the pitcher of water into there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of an even flow rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing a lot of small plants,
like one gallon size plants, one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: classics would work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know people who want to do, they're
doing a lot of clone propagation for
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might, when they transplant those
clones into smaller pots, they'll use,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you have a whole bunch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got 20, 50 of these in small
pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having a whole bunch of carrots can work
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've used that technique myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're growing, so that's like,
would be like a veg, like a plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: in a vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were flowering a plant out,
you might want to do it in a, you might
[SPEAKER_00]: need a little bit more water to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the adjustable flow rate that
comes with the trope bloom at is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: what you want in a circumstance like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are geared towards production,
the tropes work good because they really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really meet the plant's need wherever they
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: House plants, the blue mat classic is an
excellent choice to keep all your house
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, you know, nice, evenly watered and
such.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, a one gallon pot and it could go
anywhere from just one blue mat trope to,
[SPEAKER_00]: or one classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all I would do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't use any distribution drippers
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned a specific PSI that
needs to be fed to the regular blue mat
[SPEAKER_01]: carrot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want people to worry about
measuring that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it's just really,
it's gravity fed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you just, as long as it's above,
you know, hooked up to a reservoir and as
[SPEAKER_01]: long as it's above the pots, is that how
high it needs to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it will gravity feed down that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Provides enough PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you guys a little context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, PSI, it's a unit of,
it means pounds per square inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a unit of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a container that's,
so 2.31 feet of vertical head,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, equals one PSI.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the gravity pressure from 2.31 is
enough to, is really enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: One PSI is enough just to, if you're just
dripping right out of a tube, it's enough
[SPEAKER_00]: to run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: With blue mat systems in general,
we can run them a few different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can run them off of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have a reservoir that's, you know,
on a shelf and then that's providing the
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity is just providing the pressure,
that constant pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also we can have, we have a pressure
reducer that just screws onto a hose bib.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a 15 PSI pressure reducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You screw that on your hose bib and then
have the hose bib open and it's just all
[SPEAKER_00]: your lines and your system will then be
charged at 15 PSI all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have, we build pump kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a reservoir that's on the
ground that maybe you want to mix
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients into or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do that and then just pump out of
that and then we keep the lines
[SPEAKER_00]: pressurized with a little pump that has a
pressure switch and a pressure accumulator
[SPEAKER_00]: tank and then a pressure reducer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to kind of, you know,
maintain a constant pressure just pulling
[SPEAKER_00]: out of a reservoir with a small kind of
like almost pre-assembled pump kit that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes, that we offer here at the
Sustainable Village.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of the three ways to
provide that back end pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either gravity, a hose bib, you know,
or a pump kit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: All mine are gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had the Blue Mat Carrots go to three
gallon containers, five gallon containers
[SPEAKER_01]: and seven gallon containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually run in seven gallon containers
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: For three gallon grow pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the optimal irrigation method for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you put one carrot in there,
two carrots in there, or what would you
[SPEAKER_01]: do?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, again, I would stick with just
the one carrot and no drippers probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a three gallon pot, like what does
that like a maybe an eight or nine inch
[SPEAKER_00]: diameter pot or something like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That can be more than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably like roughly 12
inches, I would say.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you're getting to a point,
you know, with all these like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, smaller pots, like pots under
say 30 gallons, really one carrot per pot
[SPEAKER_00]: is all you really need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the past, people have wanted to
do more and you can and there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages to adding more carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really for, you know, I just like want
to see things work well for people and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, improve plant health,
improve yield, that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they can do that really
well with just like one five inch carrot
[SPEAKER_00]: and the series of distribution drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have any sitting right here,
but basically what we can do is with this
[SPEAKER_00]: three inch tubing, we can connect these
little distribution drippers that just go
[SPEAKER_00]: in line and make it a chain of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're different than like a drip
emitter, like a pressure compensating drip
[SPEAKER_00]: emitter, but they're similar in their
idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have like the carrot and then
when the carrot opens and it waters and it
[SPEAKER_00]: turns on, it drips in like, you know,
two places or three places or five places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, going up from the three
gallon to five gallon, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon pot, or even a three,
you know, I would go with like probably a
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot and then if you want to do it cheap
and easy, you can just do one,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just have it drip right out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want that nice even watering
coverage and, you know, maintaining that
[SPEAKER_00]: upper level of soil, very, very moist and
consistent, you know, three drippers is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we mount those drippers on little
stakes so they sit up above the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of drip down on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I don't know if anybody's,
there's a lot of like, we get these like
[SPEAKER_00]: root porn pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: People send us all the time where there'll
be like a dripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, maybe three inches
above the stake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the plants are just like,
have built a giant mound of roots and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of just, you know,
tentacling their way up to the dripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because drippers have been unclogged
before that way, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's when we started putting them
on the stakes because we would lay them on
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the roots would just kind of go into
them and just get all up in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to keep them away from the
hungry plants a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's pretty cool to see that
kind of action.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really speaks to the kind of
sensitivity with the blue mat systems
[SPEAKER_00]: because, you know, with these plants,
like say we're growing a plant indoors
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, three months or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the end of that three month growing
cycle, I might pull the carrot out and
[SPEAKER_00]: look in the hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hole is nothing but, it's just
white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all white roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after a while, the plant grows its
roots all around the ceramic cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not actually any soil touching
it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it's just root tips have grasped
this valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really then the plant is the one
that's operating the control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, I mean, the root exudates,
they basically create negative pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: fields and pull material in from the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can actually exert negative pressure
against that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's happening is the plant is going
and grabbing the valve, the water control
[SPEAKER_00]: valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now the plant's in control of how it
gets watered and when it gets watered.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's physically turning the water valve
on and off whenever it wants to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to talk about some other auto
watering options as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, folks that are watching this,
we've been introduced to Blue Mats,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you work for sustainable
village.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't want people calling us out as an
hour long infomercial.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other options out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you kind of just talk to us about like
how they work?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, the autopot system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something I've had before where,
you know, it's, it's, it's down below drip
[SPEAKER_01]: irrigation systems, pump systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you just talk about like some of the
other options out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know too much about the autopots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used them personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like a, like a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you have to buy like special
pots and special trays and, but I think
[SPEAKER_00]: they, basically there's like a water tray
at the bottom that's filled by a little
[SPEAKER_00]: float valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like a wicking action
that happens.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've heard people have good luck
with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they, yeah, I think one of
the, just one of the downsides is you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to use these, these special containers
that they, they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've heard people get really good
results with them too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, besides that,
like there's hand watering, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know, that's not, it's not that
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's nothing wrong with hand
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how people have been watering plants
for really, really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, especially we're just
talking about like home gardens and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, backyard gardens or indoor
gardens and things like that, smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: scale stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can totally get away with hand
watering, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've all done that at different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Done some hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done lots of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there's the downfalls of
that are it takes a lot of time is the
[SPEAKER_00]: main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're putting a lot of human
subjectivity into it, which isn't like
[SPEAKER_00]: always, you know, this is high quality as
it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, people make mistakes in my point
and errors and, and forget to water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and then over water, you know,
over watering in general is a really big
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the worst problem that you
might have with irrigation in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, with like house plants,
it's like something like 80% of all
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with house plants people
experience are, are over watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like want to, they want their
plants to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think that like, you know,
water equals love for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're just like, give them lots
of love and give them lots of water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want just that right amount so that
your soil doesn't get oversaturated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of things, you know,
there's a lot of downsides that can happen
[SPEAKER_00]: when, when too much water is in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the, the root exudates will seal up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't, they won't absorb any more
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means they're not observing any
more nutrients at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be really detrimental for the soil
health too, as far as the microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil, if there's, if there's too
much water and it can even, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: go on to create different pathogens,
you know, different pests and as,
[SPEAKER_00]: or as well as just like anaerobic
bacterial conditions in the soil that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, are generally want to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other, the big thing as far as
automated irrigation is drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, lots of people have used
drip irrigation and it's tons of really
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: For that, it was kind of started getting,
I think it was developed in like late 50s,
[SPEAKER_00]: early 60s in Israel, they started coming
out with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of those technologies came
to states in the 70s and, and since then
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really blown up into this huge,
you know, multi-billion dollar global
[SPEAKER_00]: industry of manufacturing irrigation
parts, drip irrigation parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those can look anything, you know,
from like the just kind of basic drip
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters that are like punched into a half
inch probably tubing or a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: see, you see, you know, they'll connect,
in a lot of indoor gardens you see these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems where there'll be like a main line
and then there'll be some sort of emitter
[SPEAKER_00]: with multiple lines coming off of it and,
and stakes that go into pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, those things, all those,
those systems definitely work and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and really for like outdoor stuff,
if you're doing anything outdoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing standard drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I did that for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it, if you're providing regular
consistent water, it's not, that's not too
[SPEAKER_00]: much, you know, it's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's definitely better than nothing,
than doing, than doing nothing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you want to be sensitive to
environmental conditions, so like if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on a timer and you get a bunch of
rain, like you got to turn the timer off
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have some sort of,
you know, moisture sensing control,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to account for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just adjusting flow rates as
plants get bigger and providing more
[SPEAKER_00]: inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just, you know, traditional drip
irrigation works really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem, the problem with it is one,
it's not very sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have same sensitivities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's just going to water the same
amount every day if it's on a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then two, it can be a little tricky
getting uniform water distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you have to size your pump
with the flow rates that you're putting
[SPEAKER_00]: out into the system or your pump or your
hose or, you know, you have to have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: flow and pressure to operate the system in
a uniform way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, again, there's just some,
some things that need to happen with that
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as planning that out and designing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at home, you know, you can usually just
do stuff, you know, fine if you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: your home gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to get on into scale at all,
it's nice to have a designer come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: design the system for you and do the
engineering behind it because those
[SPEAKER_00]: systems do require some actual engineering
as far as you know, again, understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, things like friction loss and
flow and pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of go all over the place here and we
can talk about little systems or big
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, but, and there's, and there's
different, it's like different strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: like different, different goals have
different strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, what are you growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What, you know, what size container are
you in?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your environment like?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, taking that information
[SPEAKER_00]: and applying different strategies,
finding the strategy or the technique
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to best match up what you're
trying to achieve is, that's kind of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we do over here, but like anybody can do
it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to do a little homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see how those, all the variables
would certainly impact it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into five gallon grill pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you touched on five gallon grill
pot more talk about the three gallon grill
[SPEAKER_01]: pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it one carrot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you mentioned on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could do like the one carrot,
but have it come out in several different
[SPEAKER_01]: areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you get more distribution across.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think we, you know,
I like to think about things like a good,
[SPEAKER_00]: better, best, you know, a lot of times
like what's the, what's the economy
[SPEAKER_00]: version?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the mid range version?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the deluxe version?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for a five gallon pot,
it's pretty much, you know, just have one
[SPEAKER_00]: dripper point would be your real base
level economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps the plant alive, keeps it pretty
healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's not in there for that's
like whole life of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's just for like a, you know,
a period of vegetative growth and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to transplant into something
larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's, if it's that's it's forever
home or whatever, like I would go,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, three or five drippers,
just depending on what, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how much coverage you want to do and
really like how many plants you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause a lot of this stuff, it's just,
it's all about like scalability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you've got six plants at home,
you can really just like, you got,
[SPEAKER_00]: why not go deluxe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're going to have these six really
lovely big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just for you and your friends
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, but if you're trying to, if you've
got 500 five gallon pots, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's maybe you don't need quite the
deluxe version on every one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do something a little bit more
commercial, economic, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a recommendation for like
reservoir size per container or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was running three of them and I had
this massive reservoir was sent to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, it was kind of a little silly
having like a 64 gallon reservoir or
[SPEAKER_01]: something crazy like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think it was like a 32 gallon
reservoir, but like, I only needed like
[SPEAKER_01]: five, seven, five to seven gallons because
off of like three plants and three gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: containers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a general recommendation for
like reservoir size.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on so many different
factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it has to do with like how many
plants are you watering and like how big
[SPEAKER_00]: are the plants and what size containers
they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with like five gallon pots,
you know, if, if you're growing plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: there, say in an indoor environment,
that's, you know, warm, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in high seventies or something like
that or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of transpiration and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you might, you might have a big
plant in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could figure that it could go up to a
half gallon a day of water could be used
[SPEAKER_00]: in that five gallon pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of one way to think about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're relying purely on like a gravity
fed situation, which works again,
[SPEAKER_00]: works great for that, like six to 12 plant
kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then pressurized systems tend to work
a little better for, for larger systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by pressurize, I mean like with a hose
bib or a pump.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, yeah, as far as flow rate and
container size, you know, it's all about
[SPEAKER_00]: how, how often do you want to refill it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had a 32 gallon, I would,
I mean, I like having a big reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, cause you don't have to
refill it as often.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really the main thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot, or you can have a small
reservoir and you can have a float valve
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, as soon as you use some of
that water, the flow valve kicks on and
[SPEAKER_00]: then keeps itself topped off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's another thing to think about
when using blue mats and, and gravity is
[SPEAKER_00]: like, if you have a big reservoir,
it's tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say it's like five feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that thing's full, it's going to
have, you know, a couple PSI more than
[SPEAKER_00]: when it's almost empty of pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these, the carrots are set to like a
relative pressure sensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're, you, you can get some
inconsistency if you have a very tall
[SPEAKER_00]: reservoir that you fluctuate from filled
up full to empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do have a larger reservoir,
we always recommend when people are
[SPEAKER_00]: setting the carrots, they fill the
reservoir like halfway and then they set
[SPEAKER_00]: it and then fill it the rest of the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of getting that median
pressure that you're going to find when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're dialing in the carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I like having them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this, I like having a small one,
on some sort of a float valve and that
[SPEAKER_00]: float valve, the supply line to that float
valve doesn't even have to be on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have that on a timer too,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, say you had just a five gallon
bucket as your reservoir and you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of plants, maybe a couple of times a
day, the timer kicks, like a timer kicks
[SPEAKER_00]: on and charges the water line up to that
float valve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the float valve, you know,
is if it's open, it's open and it fills
[SPEAKER_00]: and shuts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it, and then the timer turns off
and it depressurizes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, you don't have a pressurized
line like, you know, running through your
[SPEAKER_00]: house or whatever all the time,
because that can be a little, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: scary or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just a little, there's a little risk
having pressurized water lines inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned the five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say that, you know,
for most home grow applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who are growing maybe, maybe six
plants or less can get away with a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon bucket, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically you'll put, you know,
four, you know, top it off to five gallons
[SPEAKER_01]: of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's going to take a little while
for them to eat through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could just go in there every day
and just add in water if needed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I currently have a, like I bought a
trash bin and it's like a 14 gallon trash
[SPEAKER_01]: bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I use that and I don't fill it up all
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have it filled up probably
maybe five gallons at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could potentially downgrade for,
for my particular scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: But certainly I feel like folks can get
away with running, you know, carrots right
[SPEAKER_01]: to a five gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you sell the reservoir?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you just sell the piece that kind of
connects to it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell a lot of buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like one of our more popular products
is just, it's like our bucket kits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be, it'll be a reservoir with the
bulkheads drilled into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then like packed inside of it,
you know, is like enough for like six to
[SPEAKER_00]: 12 plants and all the tubing and supply
line and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that, like that whole kit,
like a bucket with all the components,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a standalone kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really nice for someone that wants to
test out blue mats or something like that
[SPEAKER_00]: and try them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also sell some other reservoirs,
but not, once we get, I don't do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the big large ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You kind of need like a, anyways,
we're just not really set up to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: really large reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some cool stackable ones that go
anywhere from like 45 to 300 gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I don't get, I don't get into
like the cisterns, the, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: multi-thousand gallon cisterns and stuff
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of, you know, one of the things we see
people use all the time is just the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the IBC tote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, I'm sure you've seen them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're on like a pallet,
like a pallet skid with a metal cage
[SPEAKER_00]: around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're about 275 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you can pretty much find those in any
like town, city in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have them, you can buy them for,
you know, a hundred, 150 bucks or
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those make pretty good, you know,
they're cheap, easy water reservoirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to make sure you get a food grade
or something, one that was, had like food
[SPEAKER_00]: grade materials in it and not like motor
oil or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's a, those are,
those are great, easy reservoirs for
[SPEAKER_00]: larger systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can, if you sit, if they're sitting
on the ground, you can pump out of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently have seven gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we'll talk about next.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two carrots going in each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the plant in the middle,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The stock in the middle and then a carrot
on each side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that is sufficient for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would you go a different route to
irrigation on a seven gallon or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like I said, like you,
one carrot is probably fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have different size.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different size carrots too,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, that was, this is a five inch
here, but I, but I also have a nine inch
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can measure different soil depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times when we're using
multiple carrots in a container,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using different size ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're measuring different soil levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if one, one of those moisture levels
dries out, there's, you know, water's
[SPEAKER_00]: applied to the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, no, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's no, like there's not a
wrong way or a right way to do stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's like good ideas and that
work, you know, more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's other ideas that are
given even like, give a little bit more
[SPEAKER_00]: edge on performance, but might be a little
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, yeah, I guess the, the way I look at
things, I tend to look at things on like a
[SPEAKER_00]: larger scale a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to, I want things, I don't like
to overbuild the systems we design.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to just, to work like just
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and to approach it more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, there's this whole market of
like indoor, you know, medicinal plant
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, then, then there's usually,
everything's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes along with that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the fertilizer might, if you're using
that same fertilizer to like grow
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetables, versus medicinal plants,
you might,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to be like drastically more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's like, it's like a tax that's
put on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the case for a lot of the big
commercial drip irrigation systems that we
[SPEAKER_00]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people putting in and they're
overbuilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're overly complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we take the principles and kind of
like ethos of how to irrigate at an ag
[SPEAKER_00]: level, like if you think you're like,
imagine you're like a beet farmer or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, like your margin is super,
super tight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really makes a lot of, you have to
just do things as, not as cheaply as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, but like as efficiently and
economically as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's ways to take those principles
and irrigate, you know, the indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: their common indoor plants that get
cultivated at scale and, and do it like
[SPEAKER_00]: much more efficiently and economically.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you use those kind of ag
principles for irrigation instead of like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, specialize like kind of lots of,
lots of bells and whistles, hydroponics
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of style irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the main concerns for folks
is the medium drying out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's one thing when you're
growing organically, you need to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: moist medium at all times or else the
microbes not going to be active.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my viewers hear me say this all the
time, the amendments are you need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: broken down and you could run into
deficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm kind of running into a
problem right now having two drippers in a
[SPEAKER_01]: seven gallon, the top layer still kind of
isn't moist at all times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even, you know, when you top dress in
organic nutrients, the area right where
[SPEAKER_01]: the dripper is, is moist.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can clearly see it, but like behind
the dripper is like dry and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: how does, how do, is there a better way to
go about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I have a soaker hose in there,
for example, in a seven gallon in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: help ensure moisture?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like to use that soaker hose till
maybe like a 15 gallon pot or something
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just, it tends to, you're going to be
better off with the drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, to your point about using dry
organic nutrients or dry nutrients at all,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a technique we like to use
sometimes we call it the nutrient well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, the idea being if you have a
dripper and your carrots controlling a
[SPEAKER_00]: series of dripper, you know, some of them
might drip right into the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're going to be suspended over the
soil and they're going to be dripping onto
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had a dry amendment,
one thing you can do is actually carve out
[SPEAKER_00]: like a little hole and fill that with
like, don't, you know, with a,
[SPEAKER_00]: with the pure nutrient, like dry nutrient
mix or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like these, these, this stuff
grow ill a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that for a while, but it's like,
you know, there's, there's lots of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Earth's the big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really similar kind of one I've been
using lately, but there's, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just like mixes of all these like
really good bone meal and blood meal and,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, alfalfa and all kinds of cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and if you have, if you have this
kind of well of that dense nutrients and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a dripper right on top of it,
you're going to, you're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: every time it waters, it's going to drip
right on that nutrient well and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just, you know, it's almost like not
really time release, but kind of it's sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of every time it waters, you're getting
this, this little bit of a flush into that
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might not want that for every
spot, but on a seven gallon pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're still relatively small container
and, you know, the plant's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to uptake a lot of those nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your point about soil drying out and
nutrients not being available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is, that's like almost the
most important thing around thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: how to irrigate plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it all has to do with that,
that, that, that ecosystem is created in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those microorganisms, if it gets too
dry, they're going to go dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it gets too wet, they're going to go
dormant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're able to hold them in that,
it's called hydro neutral zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: like Goldilocks zone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too dry, not too wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're not going to go dormant
as often and whatever their job is,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's solubilizing phosphorus or
fixing nitrogen or transferring nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever, like they're going to do that
like 24 hours a day instead of,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, only when the, you know,
when the, when the soil moisture
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions are optimal for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, I'd really, I'm glad
you're telling your, your listeners that,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, cause it's very, very true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to try out the nutrient well
method that you mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I kind of did when I talked to
you, I said the problem is it's so much,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm using a cup of build a soil craft
blend and like putting that into a seven
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon container in two spots plus worm
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's hard to keep it all in one
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also afraid of like digging down
in that area where the roots are already
[SPEAKER_01]: established to create that well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if the well is created
like in the beginning when you first plant
[SPEAKER_01]: or what.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing you'd do if you're using
blue mats is you can still top dress
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you have your blue mat
system set up, it's all dialed in,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's maintained as moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go through and either like mix up a
liquid nutrient and pour it over the top
[SPEAKER_00]: or put a dry nutrient mix into the surface
and kind of just scuff it in with your
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers just a little bit and then take,
you know, your, a wand or some water and
[SPEAKER_00]: water that in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blue mat itself is going to just turn
off and it'll just stay off until the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture is dried down to that optimal
level that you've set it to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I mean, again, like in big like
living soil, you know, grows that we see
[SPEAKER_00]: there a lot of like raised beds,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with those, you know, all this
wonderful soil mixes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll only run water through the blue
mat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they want to top dress in inputs
like a compost tea or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll just come through the greenhouse
like once a week or whatever and have like
[SPEAKER_00]: a nutrient vat mixed up somewhere,
a little day tank, you know, day mix tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whatever they want to put in there,
you know, and a small sump pump and a
[SPEAKER_00]: garden hose and a wand and just,
you know, top water in whatever they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really not that much water going in
generally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really affect the moisture
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only a few gallons generally,
you know, per raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's sort of standard operating
procedure for those like more commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil applications that are in
raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll run just plain water through the
irrigation system or through the blue
[SPEAKER_00]: mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you prevent things from,
you know, like building up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can run nutrients and liquid
inputs through blue mats or drip
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to kind of account for like
biofilm buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're running synthetic nutrients
and you have like salt buildups,
[SPEAKER_00]: mineral buildups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some products you can use to treat
that and break up the buildup that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and flush the lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can use them, you know,
kind of prophylactically throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you water in compost teas,
or sometimes I'll do a mix of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: microbial inoculant and then I'll water it
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I shouldn't be taking the them out or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do the blue mats need to be recalibrated
at any point?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only if you let the soil dry out really
significantly so that it actually dries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you get the soil really dry,
it'll pull the moisture out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once this inside of the carrot loses
enough water, its ability to turn on and
[SPEAKER_00]: off that valve diminishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can have errors like we call
them runaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the main thing that goes wrong
with blue mats is the overwater sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's some sort of issue and
it's a very short list of like
[SPEAKER_00]: troubleshooting to figure out what that
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of them could be if the carrot
dries out and there's a large air bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: in the top, it doesn't have enough
pressure to operate the valve and close it
[SPEAKER_00]: when it needs to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what if your reservoir kind of dries
out, drops all the way down to the level
[SPEAKER_01]: to where the, you know, the hose is
connected to the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the water level drops below that and
it's no longer getting water to the
[SPEAKER_01]: carrots, what will happen when the carrots
will just dry out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it just depends on how long that's
going on for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the, you know, if your reservoir
goes dry and whatever, it's like a day,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's, you know, five days or
something, again, it's all about just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, and you can check too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like sometimes, you know, if your carrot's
buried in the soil and the soil's like
[SPEAKER_00]: really dry or something's going wrong,
like, you know, the water supply turned
[SPEAKER_00]: off somehow and you want to know you can
always just like, you take, pull one
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot up and just sort of tip it upside
down, see if you see a big air bubble in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a good size air bubble but
not like, you know, but it's still moist,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, there's still some water in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can really kind of get away with just
having a bucket with you and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to re-soak it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just unscrew it, have a bucket,
stick both your hands under the water in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bucket and reseal it and then,
you know, place it back in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go through the whole
like soaking process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I mean, really once you dial them
in, they should maintain for the,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the full run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I like about it is you
kind of want to say set it and forget it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but set it and just keep the reservoir
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've got all my kitchen gardens
and stuff set up at home on my raised beds
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow my produce and stuff and whatever
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, man, you know, in May or
June, I'll go out there and turn on the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole irrigation system and like go
through and spend a day or two getting
[SPEAKER_00]: everything dialed in and fixed up and
re-soak the carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, I don't touch it until
like, I start ripping it apart,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, taking it down in October.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there has been times where I got the
proper moisture level that I felt,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually water and then the next day is
when I add the blue mats in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's typically what my plants seem to
like it the most is to wait a day and then
[SPEAKER_01]: add them in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has been times where I,
you know, I dial them in and then I come
[SPEAKER_01]: back 24 hours later and I see one of the
drippers constantly dripping.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a problem or is it just working as
normal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's, you know, they take,
they do take some tuning, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally once they're, you can kind of,
you can do that set up and forget it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you, once you get them dialed in,
maybe it takes you like a week or so to
[SPEAKER_00]: get it dialed in from once you put it in
or maybe even two weeks, like for a really
[SPEAKER_00]: nail it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's fine for the whole rest of
the growth cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets faster and faster the more
you use them too, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: once you get kind of adept at tuning them,
you can almost like feel the tension point
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're tightening them up that you
want to maintain them at.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you see something dripping and the
soil is wet, it's too wet and you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want it to wet, I mean, you should dial it
back, you know, make the adjustment for
[SPEAKER_00]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, things can happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they can get bumped in different
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you don't notice it, but like you
bumped the pot or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may be, because that's something,
like if these carrots are buried and they
[SPEAKER_00]: get jostled, and then like all of a sudden
they're not flush up against the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ceramic part, if there's air up
against the ceramic, then the carrot reads
[SPEAKER_00]: it as dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reads it as very, very dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it's going to, the valve's going
to open up and it's going to over water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if these things get like bumped a
little bit sometimes, they can cause,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's like the other, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a pretty short list of
troubleshooting if you're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering and, you know, one's the air
bubbles inside, the other is like
[SPEAKER_00]: something happened to the carrot where
like, you know, a person or a dog or a
[SPEAKER_00]: clumsy employee or somebody like hit it
or, you know, touched it in some way that
[SPEAKER_00]: made it over water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of problems, is salt buildup ever
a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like particularly when using the synthetic
fertilizers since with blue mats,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is no runoff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, is there, do you recommend like a
flush to have happen or multiple flushes
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen throughout the grow when growing
medicinal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you mean salt buildup in the soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously that's like a downside,
right, of the synthetic program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we recommend is if someone's
doing like a straight, like cocoa salt
[SPEAKER_00]: type grow, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just running synthetic
nutrients into their plants with some sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of soil as medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like, you know, the traditional
wisdom is you flush that at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: growth cycle, you know, to get a lot of
that salt out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, whenever you water,
you tend to water in terms of a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant amount of runoff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you water it until there's X amount of
runoff and that runoff is just those
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid nutrients you just bought at the
grow store for a lot of money just going
[SPEAKER_00]: right down the drain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so with the blue mats, we don't see
that drain to waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see that runoff happening because
everything that goes in the pot stays
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to account for that, what we like to
do is recommend that if you're growing a
[SPEAKER_00]: synthetic program to take the dilution
rates that you're using and are successful
[SPEAKER_00]: with and cut them in half and use half as
much nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, the added benefit, you know,
right off the bat is you're using half of
[SPEAKER_00]: the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people are getting as good or better
results by doing that with the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, like we have a bunch of
folks out there that just run cocoa and
[SPEAKER_00]: salt and like just crush it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come back and they're like,
I just didn't know we could grow like
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another product, I think we might start
carrying this, but we're not right at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it a lot though.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an awesome component to work
with the blue mats is this fertilizer
[SPEAKER_00]: product called Beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beanstalk Ag, if you've heard about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a synthetic program too,
but it's like these little pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of look like nerds or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that, actually, yeah, it's just sort
of, we were doing some R&D, but it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: these just little pellets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mix that in with the soil and it's
like a time release fertilizer,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's specifically designed to kind of
like work with the growth cycles for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the most common indoor medicinal
plants that people grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that works great with blue mats,
like the Beanstalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been doing some R&D with it because
we were thinking about actually carrying
[SPEAKER_00]: it, which would be a big departure for us
to carry a synthetic product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really geared towards organic and
sustainability and regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I just think it works so well that
it's worth, you know, promoting a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit as far as a synthetic program.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know there are some synthetics or some
bottled nutrient lines, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: that could clog, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Could clog things up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the solution to that is pec acid,
which is like drip clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a product called drip clean that's
like super common.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, yeah, using that like as directed on
the bottles, that'll take care of all
[SPEAKER_00]: those issues and keep your system clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the distribution drippers is
probably the weakest link in the blue mat
[SPEAKER_00]: system for nutrient buildup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so if you're doing a lot of plants off
nutrients, sometimes just like omit the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution drippers and just drip right
out of the tube is a technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip back into a few container sizes
and then we'll wrap things up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered all the way up to seven
gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything different for like 10 gallon
pots, 15 gallon pots, 20 gallon pots,
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as how you would lay out?
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger pots, and again, like 15
gallons up is where I started looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a 10 gallon pot, maybe you want
to sink a nine inch carrot in there in
[SPEAKER_00]: addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like a nice kind of deluxe setup for
that or higher end setup is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'd be a five inch carrot with like say
five distribution drippers around the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside edge of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The distribution drippers would water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you take a second nine inch
carrot and sink it right near the base of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outer ring, the outer edge of the
pot is being monitored by the five inch
[SPEAKER_00]: carrot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's this one single drip
point near the base of the plant that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being monitored, you know, being monitored
by the nine inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of mimics that like inverse
pyramid that a root mass tends to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you take a plant out and shake
it and you notice that there's generally
[SPEAKER_00]: like a lot of roots on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's like the tap root down
the middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the root mass of the
plant, it kind of looks like the inverse
[SPEAKER_00]: pyramid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're measuring, you know, soil
moisture kind of, you know, it corresponds
[SPEAKER_00]: to that structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice for a 10 gallon,
nine inch in the middle, and then five
[SPEAKER_00]: inch with five drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then yeah, once we get 15 and above,
you know, having a little piece of that
[SPEAKER_00]: blue soak on one carrot is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it really gives nice super even
coverage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the bigger the pots we get,
you know, we get into 30s, 45s,
[SPEAKER_00]: 65s, 100s, 200s, whatever, really,
it's just usually a big spiral that blue
[SPEAKER_00]: spoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because that stuff we can turn corners
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't kink.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can just do like one big spiral.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, soil dries out and nice even
layer of water gets laid down on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about some of the common beds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I know a lot of folks are like three
by three bed, four by four bed,
[SPEAKER_01]: five by five bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you do for those?
[SPEAKER_00]: You could still do that, you know,
with the, you know, like three by three,
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four, you still do that spiral
kind of shape if you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a carrot, and then kind of over that,
we use this double manifold system where
[SPEAKER_00]: basically the carrot feeds into a little
header of this eight millimeter tubing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then off of that are four lines of
drip, of drip soak, of the blue soak,
[SPEAKER_00]: the soaker hose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one carrots can, you know, basically is
controlling four eight foot lines that
[SPEAKER_00]: like on a four by eight bed, for instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you'd have a one carrot that
when it turns on, it feeds into a little
[SPEAKER_00]: header and that header waters four eight
foot lines that run the length of the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll actually, sometimes we'll kind
of mirror that structure on both sides of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have two carrots and they both feed
into the same system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if either carrot dries out,
it turns on the water and can infill it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of monitoring a couple of
different places in the bed with maybe a
[SPEAKER_00]: nine inch and a five inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the double manifold bed is,
that's how we water everything from like
[SPEAKER_00]: four by four, four by eight up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, a lot of these guys are
growing in like, you know, four by
[SPEAKER_00]: nineties or four by 120 even, or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In big greenhouses or big indoor
applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as we just break up like,
oh, every 10 feet, there's like a zone,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, down the row or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we could sit here and talk for
another three hours if we really wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to, but we're going to end it here at the
one hour mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us, how can the listeners find you
and what do you have upcoming in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let's see, a bunch of different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first thing is if you go to the
website, sustainablevillage.com,
[SPEAKER_00]: we do free design work for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another thing I forgot to mention.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so there's a quote request
button right on sustainablevillage.com and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's free.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put some information in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a home garden that you want an
irrigation system designed for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you hit the button, you fill out a little
form and one of our designers will get
[SPEAKER_00]: back to you really pretty quickly with
like a drawing of the system, a
[SPEAKER_00]: description of how it works and a complete
parts list for everything you need for it
[SPEAKER_00]: and like no pressure to buy or anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of a little service we do and
have all the customer service and tech
[SPEAKER_00]: supports kind of back it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if everybody's interested in Blue
Math system, they're curious about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can go down to sustainablevillage.com
and click on that quote request button.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are we doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually doing a trade show next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a traditional ag show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Colorado farm show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's up in Greeley, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a big traditional ag show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a conference up in southern
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really pretty impressive lineup of
people there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was really honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: They asked me to come speak, so I'm going
to do a presentation there on just
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation, all kinds of irrigation
techniques and stuff there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll be out at that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have our offices here in
Boulder, Colorado, so and a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouses just stacked to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gills with irrigation parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll design systems and then,
you know, we sell the parts to go along
[SPEAKER_00]: with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And check us out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can check us out on Instagram.
