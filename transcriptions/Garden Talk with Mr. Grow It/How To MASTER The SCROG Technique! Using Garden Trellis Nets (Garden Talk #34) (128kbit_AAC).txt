[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on garden talk the very top two
leaves that come out and pull those off
[SPEAKER_01]: and allow that light to Penetrate down and
they'll start to branch out by themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: without that stunt period of actually
popping the top off The second layer is
[SPEAKER_01]: for support.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is field.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want that canopy filled out I don't want
to be growing the floor Literally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll make the top leaves of the canopy
kiss the bottom of that net as soon as I
[SPEAKER_01]: bring them in I want to say too But I'll
even give it three anything over a three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pot starts to become wasteful and
cocoa those Are still valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they'd like to say cut from the top
But I haven't really seen any difference
[SPEAKER_01]: from taking clones from the top or the
bottom I'll defoliate and veg too if I see
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's getting too thick and I want
more branching I'll defoliate and veg but
[SPEAKER_01]: those little silver ones that you get out
of beauty section that like Walmart or
[SPEAKER_01]: something I'm talking about just one
little snip.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pop right through that net like it's
nothing What's up everybody if you that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know me my name is Chris aka mr Root
and you're tuned into the garden dog

grows a variety of plants such as berries
[SPEAKER_00]: peaches Plums apples pears medicinal herbs
and many different types of vegetables in
[SPEAKER_00]: this episode He talks a little bit about
his gross style and then gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that he does very often and very
well The scrub technique and he gets into
[SPEAKER_00]: very specific detail on that topic Thanks

[SPEAKER_00]: products all right we are back welcome to
the garden talk podcast today I am joined
[SPEAKER_00]: with Beast Coast grower how you doing
today I'm all right how's everything doing
[SPEAKER_00]: great man glad to have you on board on
today's episode we are gonna get deep into
[SPEAKER_00]: the scrub technique and kind of using a
trellis net plant training we'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit about you and your grow setup
I think it's gonna be a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: episode today I've had quite a few people
asking me about the scrub technique and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that's something you do very very
well so I'm excited for this one yeah me
[SPEAKER_00]: too but before we kind of get into the
nitty-gritty of things can you tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about yourself and kind of how
you got into gardening yes Beast Coast
[SPEAKER_01]: Grower 420 the main reason that I got into
gardening is because I'm vegan been vegan
[SPEAKER_01]: for a while so it kind of made me want to
go into like growing my own foods which
[SPEAKER_01]: got me into a lot of the the plant growing
and after that a friend of mine winded up
[SPEAKER_01]: with cancer and as he was recovering from
the chemotherapy I decided to start
[SPEAKER_01]: looking up different herbs and medicinal
plants that would be good to help him in
[SPEAKER_01]: the recovery process of the cancer and
that's how I stumbled across a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other plants that came along with it but
I've always been a nature person always
[SPEAKER_01]: love growing plants always like to tap in
but I would probably be called the tree
[SPEAKER_01]: hugger that's it I'd be one of those guys
I just something about nature always
[SPEAKER_01]: called me so that's what really pulled me
into wanting to grow that's pretty cool
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah my dad just had lung cancer got
diagnosed with that and he was going
[SPEAKER_00]: through radiation and chemotherapy and he
doesn't smoke I mean he tried it way back
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day he's older now he's elderly and
I somewhat convinced him to do it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned you know chemotherapy one of
the things is you get nauseous sick after
[SPEAKER_00]: the fact now I'd mentioned to him I'm like
hey that's one thing that cannabis helps
[SPEAKER_00]: you with is the nausea it helps you go
away you feel better would you be willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to try it he said yes now the thing is
they give you now with chemo a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of different medication that offset all
the side effects so he actually didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have any side effects from the chemo which
I thought was amazing it was crazy Wow so
[SPEAKER_00]: he never got a chance to try it but
cannabis kind of being you know helpful on
[SPEAKER_00]: the cancer side of things in various ways
you know yeah I'm glad you brought that up
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is definitely helpful on that
Avenue yes especially when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: like appetite even because a lot of people
who go through that they really lose their
[SPEAKER_01]: appetite so that's another way to bring on
the appetite I'm glad medical science has
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten so good that they have things that
can counter the effects of the radiation
[SPEAKER_00]: though yeah yeah for sure and then before
we started talking you talked about how
[SPEAKER_00]: you grow a whole variety of things I mean
you're on berries apples pears peaches
[SPEAKER_00]: plums all sorts of vegetables so it's not
just those medicinal varieties you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing a lot of different things yes
heavy in a permaculture that's what that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what originally pulled me was people
building their own food forest and just
[SPEAKER_01]: giving back to nature so that that called
me as soon as I seen that I'm like yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta do this yeah that's awesome so I you
an indoor grower outdoors do you do both
[SPEAKER_00]: both both okay what's your overall kind of
gross style well for outdoor of course a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent organic I like to go right
into the ground it just makes life a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: easier on the indoor cocoa and then tell
me a little bit more about your indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: gross setup you know what size grow space
you working in what do you have for
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting how's your ventilation run so on
and so forth okay so on the indoor there's
[SPEAKER_01]: one room that is a I say probably like an
eight by eight by like 18 roughly but I
[SPEAKER_01]: use about a four by 16 for canopy space
one gallon pots of cocoa on flood trays
[SPEAKER_01]: but instead of flooding and draining
there's a watering system that sits inside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the tray loop around just to get it
pressurized and each tray has its own
[SPEAKER_01]: watering system one minute a day open flow
water as soon as the lights come on
[SPEAKER_01]: trellis of course double trellis if
necessary switched over to LEDs a while
[SPEAKER_01]: back because LEDs are just way more
efficient didn't have to worry about any
[SPEAKER_01]: heat when it came to those summer runs
anymore it just made life a lot easier
[SPEAKER_01]: once I switched over to LEDs so I try to
keep it as simple as possible 12 plants
[SPEAKER_01]: per tray one gallon pots of cocoa open
flow watering system one minute a day two
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes in the middle of flowers sometimes
if necessary because sometimes around week
[SPEAKER_01]: four week five they'll tend to drink a
little bit more so that's when I'll up the
[SPEAKER_01]: watering if necessary but on open flow
people got to remember that it's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more water coming out than those pressure
regulated ones that's given 0.3 whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: per hour so since mine is open flow one
minute is more than enough sounds like
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're working with a large amount of
plants this by much easier for you to have
[SPEAKER_00]: that hooked up to automated systems like
that yes yes especially once you put the
[SPEAKER_01]: trellis nets on because you can't really
reach in with a wand or anything in water
[SPEAKER_01]: it just makes everything a hundred times
more difficult so much easier to get them
[SPEAKER_01]: on that watering system early so when the
nets is set you pretty much free got it
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's a question I'm gonna ask you
later on we'll get deeper into it once we
[SPEAKER_00]: get into scrub I got to ask do you
typically grow from seed or you starting
[SPEAKER_01]: from clone most of the time most of the
time the room will be filled predominantly
[SPEAKER_01]: with clones but I saved one tray and one
of the rooms specifically just for phenol
[SPEAKER_01]: hunt and I've always phenol hunted I pop
new seeds as soon as I'm done with a
[SPEAKER_01]: phenol hunt I'm always looking for
something new and I want something of my
[SPEAKER_01]: own like it's good to acquire the cuts
that are available to get those keeper
[SPEAKER_01]: cuts that other people sourced out but
sometimes I just want my own phenol and I
[SPEAKER_01]: might not like the phenol that they chose
to keep and run with so I'd rather hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: through it myself and see what I can find
so sometimes I'm starting from seed but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's never gonna be a full run from seed
predominantly the room will be of the
[SPEAKER_00]: keeper stock of clones that I've had okay
that was actually a viewer question wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to know about seed versus clone that's one
thing I don't really ask the viewers much
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like oh that's a great question might
as well start asking them because you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it does make a difference in some ways it
does some people say that seeds are more
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous than the clones are but it it
really comes down to technique what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you doing it for are you just
hunting for personal use is it just
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you want to do or are you
involved in the industry do you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual space to be able to do bigger hunts
so since I don't want to dedicate a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: space to hunting I just got one four by
four tray in the room that's right by the
[SPEAKER_01]: door so you can monitor it for any herms
or anything as soon as you walk in and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's normally the trade that I'll
dedicate to phenol hunts oh okay that's
[SPEAKER_00]: smart it's good way of going about doing
it okay so now that we have some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: basics out of the way let's kind of dive a
little bit into plant training and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll get into like the scrub technique so
what type of plant training do you
[SPEAKER_00]: typically do are you doing top topping any
low stress training super cropping fimming
[SPEAKER_01]: what do you typically do well from the
beginning water and solo cups as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: they start getting a bit tall I do what
what I label as the grandmaster level
[SPEAKER_01]: topping technique where you just take the
very top two leaves that come out and pull
[SPEAKER_01]: those off and allow that light to
penetrate down and they'll start to branch
[SPEAKER_01]: out by themselves without that stunt
period of actually popping the top off so
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll never stop growing they'll just
focus more on branching from that point
[SPEAKER_01]: out so from the moment they're in solo
cups and I see them start to go for that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch I start to periodically pull those
top two leaves off everything until you
[SPEAKER_01]: get that wine glass shape that you're
looking for some people train for that
[SPEAKER_01]: some people top for that but I don't like
to keep to stunt the plants and keep them
[SPEAKER_01]: short they'll grow they'll grow wide
enough just by simply pulling those top
[SPEAKER_01]: two leaves off now when it comes to plant
training they normally don't really get
[SPEAKER_01]: any training until they get moved into the
flower room from from veg they're
[SPEAKER_01]: compacted to together because my veg space
is smaller than my flower space so I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to compact them together and veg and they
kind of grow straight up minus me pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: those top leaves but as soon as they get
into the flower room they get one week of
[SPEAKER_01]: veg before they get flipped and during
that week is when the net goes on and I
[SPEAKER_01]: start to fold them out right then and
there so I'll pull everything from the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms that I feel don't need to be there
get them laid under that net immediately
[SPEAKER_01]: and give them a week to really fill that
net out before flip and then by that time
[SPEAKER_01]: you could just let them go set that second
layer and net and they'll just grow right
[SPEAKER_01]: into it you won't have to really train
into that second layer let's talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: the scrub tuck you can a little bit more
detail so net let's start this net how big
[SPEAKER_00]: of a net do you use I know you said you
were in a four foot your canopy was four
[SPEAKER_00]: feet by 16 feet so you just run a net all
the way down or what all the way down so
[SPEAKER_01]: they have these nets that you can buy that
come on like a like a spool almost like a
[SPEAKER_01]: big like yarn thread thing they come on a
huge one and you could just pull them out
[SPEAKER_01]: so yeah we in that room 16 feet and some
of the other rooms there's 25 feet of
[SPEAKER_01]: trellis netting and we just hook them up
and get those things set right away I was
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to get those metal poles that you
can screw into the ground that can hold
[SPEAKER_01]: them because one thing you'll notice is if
you're using PVC or something as a setup
[SPEAKER_01]: for your trellis netting they they have a
tendency to bow in and I don't like having
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with that so you got to find a
strong enough structure to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: attach the trellis to so you don't have to
worry about that happening so you could
[SPEAKER_00]: get the full use out of the trellis what
are you attaching to the trellis to now
[SPEAKER_01]: and how are you attaching it we I use
screws and I screwed two by fours into
[SPEAKER_01]: each corner of where each tray would be
four feet wide on on both ends and on one
[SPEAKER_01]: end I actually had to brace it and
actually make like a how can I describe it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a two by four that kind of locks
on and each round I could just unscrew it
[SPEAKER_01]: and pull it right off but that's what I
have to use on the other end because it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have really anything to brace to
so just regular screws hook them into the
[SPEAKER_01]: two by fours and pull the net straight
across I try to do this before the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: get too tall though because it gets more
hectic the bigger you let the plants get
[SPEAKER_01]: because then you really got to start
weaving up through it so you almost want
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it to where they're just kissing
the bottom of the net and then after that
[SPEAKER_01]: week they'll just start to grow into it
and all you got to do is just move them
[SPEAKER_00]: out as they get through those nets okay
the screwing into the board is interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: when I did this grog when I've done it a
handful of times probably maybe a dozen
[SPEAKER_00]: times at the most and I usually do it in
grow tents so what I usually use is zip
[SPEAKER_00]: ties and I'll zip tie it to the side of
the grow tent poles so that's another way
[SPEAKER_00]: to go about it if any listeners are
wondering how to do it within a grow tent
[SPEAKER_01]: and in that system you got something more
stable because that tent is braced on each
[SPEAKER_01]: corner so you don't have to worry about
the tent bowing in on you because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: built the way that it's built so that's
what I'm saying when people got to lay the
[SPEAKER_01]: net make sure that you got something
sturdy enough that when you pull that net
[SPEAKER_01]: tight it stays tight it doesn't wind up
bowing in the structure that you got for
[SPEAKER_00]: it really good point so for the actual net
told you we're gonna get deep on this one
[SPEAKER_00]: let's go is there a particular brand I
don't know if you mentioned the brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're well from what you were explaining
in the type of net is it the polypropylene
[SPEAKER_00]: type nets that you've got polyester you've
got nylon polypropylene you've got chicken
[SPEAKER_00]: wire so there are different options
polypropylene the plastic type no I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: using the nylons nylon okay so it is
stretchy you like the stretchiness yes yes
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to the plastic ones in the
plastic I don't know what made me stick
[SPEAKER_01]: with the nylon ones but normally it's the
nylon ones because they come on the big
[SPEAKER_01]: spool they're just easy to hook on roll it
down hook it to the other side cut it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're good to go yeah yeah I would think
the stretchiness would be beneficial I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean it's been beneficial for me I know a
lot of people use this chicken wire and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's more affixed and you're really not
gonna have be able to bend it at all have
[SPEAKER_01]: you used chicken wire at all or no I was
also worried about if that wire ever got
[SPEAKER_01]: wet or anything would what would happen
with it leaning on the stems like I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep wire and metal kind of away from the
plants because I I'm not saying it will
[SPEAKER_01]: cause any issues but the the less risk the
better so I try to stay away from those
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of things and know most people that
are using those they reuse them right yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah they'll reuse them I got a fear of
reusing stuff like that because if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: ever a problem powdery mildew bugs
anything you just inviting it right back
[SPEAKER_01]: into each round every time that you do
that so with the nylon ones it's easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: just pull them off after each round toss
them pull the next one on the next one
[SPEAKER_00]: good point now on the trellis net I know
there there are so many different ones out
[SPEAKER_00]: there but the trellis net holes right the
holes are different sizes you know I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's three inches by three inches four
inches by four inches what size you
[SPEAKER_01]: typically use the three and a half inch I
tried the fives I tried everything else I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like the fives are more for support
so if I was gonna use like the five inch
[SPEAKER_01]: squares I would do that on a second layer
and that where I'm not exactly trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: weave anything into place or use it to
fill out the canopy but when it's time to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill out the canopy I want those three and
a half inch square so that way I can make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that I got a head in every square and
that the canopy is full but when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using the five inch ones it's gonna be
multiple tops in each one and hopefully
[SPEAKER_01]: you can even get it filled if you need to
pull a branch over it doesn't really snag
[SPEAKER_01]: the right way that you want it to because
the squares are so big so on the first
[SPEAKER_01]: layer in that it's always three and a half
inch but if I if I can't find anymore I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't mind using the five inch squares on
the second layer where it's just more for
[SPEAKER_01]: support than it is for actually weaving
them through to fill out the canopy you
[SPEAKER_00]: bring up a great point with the support
side of things it's one thing I was gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: mention at some point is you know some
people use the trellis stand scroc
[SPEAKER_00]: technique because they want to maximize
yield other people they just want it for
[SPEAKER_00]: plant support which way do you do both for
support and yield or what do you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: aim for using the second layer is for
support the first one is field I want that
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy filled out I don't want to be
growing the floor I don't want any light
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting that floor if I could prevent it
because anything underneath that first
[SPEAKER_01]: layer and that is getting lolly popped off
anyway so I don't I don't want any light
[SPEAKER_01]: penetrating through there I just want a
full canopy from that first layer in that
[SPEAKER_01]: up through that second one so it's for you
it's for yield for me now granted the
[SPEAKER_01]: second layer is more for support because
you don't want them flopping over after
[SPEAKER_01]: they get big but that that first layer is
strictly yield yield driven makes sense
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you bring up a great point just
want to echo what you said before is the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger the square it seems like it's the
harder it is to kind of manipulate the
[SPEAKER_00]: plan and keep plants tucked under because
the squares are so big and yes you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple shoots coming out one square and
so yeah I mean I had this I had this nylon
[SPEAKER_00]: one where it stretched and as it stretch
it to the grow tent the holes would get
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger you know what I mean so it just
made it more difficult yes I feel like the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole the size of squares I feel like it
is pretty important yes they start off as
[SPEAKER_01]: fives but once they start to stretch they
wind up even bigger and if you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: shorter squatter plants like the strain
dependent those fives will really hurt you
[SPEAKER_01]: because with the shorter and squatter they
are the more you're gonna want to train
[SPEAKER_01]: them out to really get that penetration
into the inside and you cannot do that
[SPEAKER_00]: with the fives gotcha now how many plants
are you putting per I was gonna say square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot but really I mean you're so maybe
like a four foot by four foot area how
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants do you typically have in that
like under the net 12 to 16 per four by
[SPEAKER_01]: four really strain dependent if I'm doing
something like ice cream cake I would use
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 because they stretch about 200% once
they hit flower so I don't want to load
[SPEAKER_01]: that into heavy because then the canopy
would be too packed now if I'm running
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's a little less vigorous
I'll do 16 to make up for the fact that
[SPEAKER_01]: during that stretch it's not gonna give me
the same thing and it'll work better to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill the canopy out if I do 16 of that
strain versus 12 of another strain so 12
[SPEAKER_00]: to 16 give or take and I know you said
you're in one gallon containers small
[SPEAKER_00]: containers you're on an auto watering
system so that's very helpful there to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep everything saturated or else if
you're not on an auto watering system it's
[SPEAKER_00]: right you know it can dry out super quick
yes and then you do a lot more labor there
[SPEAKER_00]: and with the more the higher plant count
versus if you just do four plants for
[SPEAKER_00]: example right you're looking at a shorter
veg time too so that's a yes that's you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be filling up that space a lot
quicker than you would with less plants
[SPEAKER_01]: yes that was worth pointing out there that
was the goal and when you're using cocoa I
[SPEAKER_01]: think anything over I want to say two but
I'll even give it three anything over a
[SPEAKER_01]: three gallon pot starts to become wasteful
in cocoa gotcha and so okay so you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: your 12 plants roughly in that space
actually have four four feet by 16 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: now what point do you you touched on this
earlier I believe what point you put up
[SPEAKER_00]: that first layer of trellis net and then
what is the distance between the grow pot
[SPEAKER_01]: and the net it kind of depends on how big
the plants are when they go into the room
[SPEAKER_01]: but usually I'll set that first net
literally I'll make the top leaves of the
[SPEAKER_01]: canopy kiss the bottom of that net as soon
as I bring them in so I'll bring the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in and even if I need to I'll cut
them back just to make everything even so
[SPEAKER_01]: if there's a couple branches that are just
reaching out on top of everything else
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just cut those clean off just to even
out the canopy and I'll set the net right
[SPEAKER_01]: to the very very top of it so it's usually
about maybe 18 inches from from pot to
[SPEAKER_01]: where the first layer of trellis netting
is I typically do 18 inches too that's
[SPEAKER_00]: right you know might be 20 inches at time
depending on plant growth like yes and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna be a determinant of it as
well yes so when do you start actually
[SPEAKER_00]: weaving the plants to now you mentioned
that you don't do any topping okay
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional thing I mean I read some
articles before we even started talking
[SPEAKER_00]: here just kind of refresh my memories and
come up with some questions traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: way is to top in between the third and
fifth notes way the third note fourth note
[SPEAKER_00]: a fifth note and allowing those lower
branches to kind of come up into the net
[SPEAKER_00]: and spread out now you don't do that you
do that other technique that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: and that allows to grow the plants so at
what point are you kind of weaving you
[SPEAKER_00]: said you added it in you've got the net
going right away so pretty much right away
[SPEAKER_00]: is when you're starting to weave as the
plants are just growing or what within
[SPEAKER_01]: that first week of them being in the
flower room even though that first week is
[SPEAKER_01]: still veg they're in the flower room but
they're gonna veg for a week in that
[SPEAKER_01]: flower room and that week is more than
enough because I set the net just above
[SPEAKER_01]: them so within that first week of growth
because there's way more light now there's
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 now there's so many other things now
that they're gonna skyrocket the second
[SPEAKER_01]: you get them into that that bigger room so
within that first week I have that net
[SPEAKER_01]: fully filled out because I didn't set it
so high above where the plants were that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to wait for too much growth any
growth that comes in past the point when
[SPEAKER_01]: they first get in there has to get weaved
through or it's gonna wind up just being
[SPEAKER_01]: too tall and overshadowing things in the
corners I try to keep the canopy is even
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible like when I'm when I'm done
with around I want to just be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: scoop down and look at eye level and be
able to just see flat straight across if
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can yeah I know that is the goal for
the even canopy for Scrog Taktika you know
[SPEAKER_00]: using the trellis net does help a lot of
people call it the Scrog net by the way so
[SPEAKER_00]: same yes yeah it definitely helps keep
that even canopy now some folks what
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll do is you know they let their
plants grow up and then they'll do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lollipopping right they remove the lower
growth do you do that before your plants
[SPEAKER_00]: come into the net or do you wait until a
certain point that the plants grow and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you'll do the lollipopping what I do
is I wait for that week of edge to be over
[SPEAKER_01]: so once I bring them into that flower room
give them that week of edge see exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: which branches will make it through and
which ones won't because some branches I
[SPEAKER_01]: still won't pull off even after that week
of edge because I know during the first
[SPEAKER_01]: three weeks of stretch those will still
make it so it's kind of it's kind of it
[SPEAKER_01]: might hurt you in the long run to pull
some of those off too early because they
[SPEAKER_01]: could have winded up making it through and
those would have been great secondaries
[SPEAKER_01]: right there and I don't want to cut those
off I want to see what's gonna make it and
[SPEAKER_01]: what's not now granted there are gonna be
some things that clean are just not gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: make it I'll take those off before they
even make it into the flower room but
[SPEAKER_01]: there's some that I'll leave and I'll just
monitor for a while until about week two
[SPEAKER_01]: of flower and then if I know by then that
you're not gonna make it I'll lollipop
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that I know isn't gonna make it
when running these kind of setups you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to constantly have a decent amount of
clones ready to go every single time so
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of pulling those bottom ones off
just a lollipop and throw them out it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be good to that's where you can get a
boatload of clones from right from those
[SPEAKER_01]: bottoms that you normally would have threw
away those those are still valuable I know
[SPEAKER_01]: they like to say cut from the top but I
haven't really seen any difference from
[SPEAKER_00]: taking clones from the top or the bottom
that's an efficient way to go about that
[SPEAKER_00]: instead just pruning those and neither
thrown away or throw them in your compost
[SPEAKER_00]: pile actually using them as clones now one
more thing with the lollipopping generally
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking some folks what they do is
they'll do you know you mentioned about 18
[SPEAKER_00]: inches to the net from the pot some people
take they'll use that as their guide and
[SPEAKER_00]: they lollipop everything below that is
that what you do or do you yes do more or
[SPEAKER_01]: less well since I eventually once I got
into it I started to learn more about leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: stripping so it really depends on how tall
the plant get will determine how much I
[SPEAKER_01]: pull off at the bottom because I know once
I leaf strip a lot of that light is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to penetrate now and things that
wouldn't have been valuable before now
[SPEAKER_01]: have the opportunity of being valuable so
it once I leaf strip I can kind of get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good idea and that's normally around like
week two is when I start to leaf stripping
[SPEAKER_01]: week two flower so once I see what's gonna
make it and what's not and what will be
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable and what won't get any light no
matter what that's when I'll know what to
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly pull off I don't like to pull
anything off before then because I know I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to the leaf strip I'm gonna expose a
whole bunch of branches on those bottoms
[SPEAKER_01]: to like that they wouldn't have had prior
to that leaf strip so I have to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: wait to see how it plays out from there
and again a strain dependent because some
[SPEAKER_01]: strains all the branches stretch when they
hit flower and some strange is mainly just
[SPEAKER_01]: the top ones that will stretch when they
hit flower so it kind of comes down to
[SPEAKER_01]: what strain I'm running will go based on
what technique that I'm gonna have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: and in some instances yes everything from
underneath that first layer and that is
[SPEAKER_01]: gone because it's stretched so far above
it that nothing down there is gonna get no
[SPEAKER_01]: light no matter how much leaf stripping
that I wind up doing so in some cases Jeff
[SPEAKER_01]: that is my god that first layer and that
anything underneath it under most
[SPEAKER_00]: circumstances is gone you bring up some
really good points there so you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: when you start weaving the plants
underneath the trellis when do you stop
[SPEAKER_00]: doing the weaving and kind of let them
grow vertical from there when I can't when
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't contain it anymore when I come
into the room and there's so much growth
[SPEAKER_01]: after they've been flipped in the flower
that no matter what I would have to almost
[SPEAKER_01]: break a branch in order to move it
anywhere else that's when I just have to
[SPEAKER_01]: let it go I can't I can't really do much
past that point and most of the times all
[SPEAKER_01]: the squares are filled in by then there's
really nowhere to put them past that point
[SPEAKER_01]: once they flip in the flower so worse come
to worse if they start getting too tall I
[SPEAKER_01]: can pull a branch over through that second
layer in that so I don't have to let it
[SPEAKER_01]: shoot straight up I could kind of pull it
off to the side or something like that but
[SPEAKER_01]: I normally stop as soon as I hit flower
because you just can't contain it anymore
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much growth going on each day
that I will have to pull the branch back
[SPEAKER_01]: down and then over and now I'm risking
breaking branches and having to move
[SPEAKER_01]: around and break other branches from other
plants I just I don't like to I don't like
[SPEAKER_01]: to mess with them like that I've learned
my lesson from doing that broke a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: branches so basically you're correct me if
I'm wrong you're filling up the that first
[SPEAKER_00]: net then flipping the flower yes okay and
then you're kind of letting them grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: words and if you can continue to tuck down
you will but for the most part you're kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of letting them grow upwards and at some
point you're adding in a second layer of
[SPEAKER_00]: trellis more for support right yes what
point you typically find that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: adding in that second layer is it within
the first three weeks of stretch that
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch period first three weeks of flower
or when I already have the level set
[SPEAKER_01]: because once you do round after round
after round you know where you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: flip you know where they're pretty much
gonna end so I already have two layers of
[SPEAKER_01]: hooks for that second layer of net
depending on how tall the plant gets I
[SPEAKER_01]: have one layer if they're gonna stay a
little bit more squat but I got a second
[SPEAKER_01]: layer just in case for those really tall
ones because so sometimes there's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: gap in between the first and second layer
in that and sometimes not so big but I
[SPEAKER_01]: have those hooks already set in in the
room so as soon as I'm I usually since I
[SPEAKER_01]: know what strain I'm already gonna be
running when I lay the first net I'll lay
[SPEAKER_01]: the second one right away I won't even
have to wait for it and then what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: distance between the first net and the
second net probably about another 18
[SPEAKER_01]: inches 18 20 inches roughly depending on
the strain because if I'm running
[SPEAKER_01]: something like poly shore or ice cream
cake as soon as they hit flower they're
[SPEAKER_01]: shooting for the moon like so on strains
like that it's gonna be a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger of a gap in between the canopy
because they just go so crazy if I set it
[SPEAKER_01]: lower I will wind up having to put a third
layer of trellis and I don't like three
[SPEAKER_00]: layers yeah they can grow super quick and
one of the techniques that I do and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure if you do it at all is as I find
shoots are kind of outgrowing other shoots
[SPEAKER_00]: is super cropping technique I don't know
if you do that at all or I guess my
[SPEAKER_00]: question is how do you manage when some of
these plants are outgrowing others or some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the branches are outgrowing others
within that same net usually I'll just try
[SPEAKER_01]: to pull them out the way try to get them
over to the to the corners to allow that
[SPEAKER_01]: light to get into the middles and over to
those other corners but worse come to
[SPEAKER_01]: worse I will super cropping that's that's
when you pinch them and let them fall over
[SPEAKER_01]: right work I have had to do that a couple
of times actually because they'll some
[SPEAKER_01]: some plants just go for the gusto they
don't want to share no space with nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: else around them so sometimes yes I will
have to go in and pinch them and super
[SPEAKER_01]: crop them sometimes I'm really scared to
do it because I've broken a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: branches like that but there's a technique
to it you got to be gentle you got to be
[SPEAKER_01]: soft you can't go in there on yeah I am
man hear me roar you got you got to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of give them a nice pinch and let them
fall over naturally so yes I have had the
[SPEAKER_01]: super crop before and if necessary I'll do
it as often as I need to on any other
[SPEAKER_00]: branches that that needed gotcha yeah I
actually went so far one time to this was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of a mistake things that I deem as a
mistake I still got a yield out of it but
[SPEAKER_00]: I let the plant grow all the way up into
the net and then flipped a flower and I
[SPEAKER_00]: continued to tuck under that first net it
wasn't completely full so I was able still
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of tuck continued to tuck added that
second layer in order to control the
[SPEAKER_00]: height I actually topped the plants at
that point I know it's a huge no-no to top
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants and flower but it totally yeah
it was in the first three weeks right so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it was like day seven and I topped
the plants and now unfortunately it
[SPEAKER_00]: continued to stretch for you know roughly
another 10 to 14 days or something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that but the top plant the shoots weren't
really really that big so like it wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: there wasn't buds on those branches and it
was just kind of a mistake there so yes I
[SPEAKER_00]: know going forward I'm not gonna do any
topping I thought it might have been
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial I thought topping there might
have actually helped some of the lowers on
[SPEAKER_00]: the other end fill up the remaining part
of the net and I think it did but overall
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it was it was worth it on
that avenue yeah that's the reason that
[SPEAKER_01]: worse come to worse I'll chop all taller
branches off a week before they make it
[SPEAKER_01]: into that flower room for that last week
of veg before they flip that way I can get
[SPEAKER_01]: the canopy as even as possible at that
point and anything else that's coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: will roughly be on the same wavelength as
the rest of them because if not man like
[SPEAKER_01]: you said you'll wind up needing to either
top or do massive super cropping later on
[SPEAKER_01]: in flower and I try to lead the plants
alone as much as possible once they're in
[SPEAKER_01]: flower I don't really like to bother them
I like them to let them focus on a
[SPEAKER_01]: development that they're focused on at
that point that's a really good way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it for sure that's I think is gonna
actually help you know making more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficient you know maximize yield do you
have any tips for maximizing the scrub net
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you already kind of mentioned a
couple things here and there right you've
[SPEAKER_00]: run more additional plants I'm sure that
helps felt the growth the scrub net do you
[SPEAKER_00]: have any other tips or kind of how to
maximize that scrub net or fill it up
[SPEAKER_00]: either as quickly as possible or how to
maybe maneuver them so they're filled up
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say don't don't rely on the fact that
during stretch that they're gonna fill
[SPEAKER_01]: that net out because sometimes just that
main branch will shoot straight up and
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll still have gaps in the canopy so
before you flip it is good to give them
[SPEAKER_01]: just that one week of edge underneath that
net and if you see that a week is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: too much shave it down to four or five
days knock a day or two off of it if you
[SPEAKER_01]: see like okay the canopy is exactly where
I want it right now it's fully filled up
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants have already turned back up and
and they're they're looking back at the at
[SPEAKER_01]: the light everything's good go ahead and
flip but make sure that the net is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much filled out before you even flip don't
try to rely on that stretch darn flip to
[SPEAKER_01]: fill the rest of that net out the stems
get thicker they get a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: woody they get harder to manipulate unless
you're using silica and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_01]: but to avoid doing any of that just have
them pretty much ready before you even
[SPEAKER_01]: flip them yeah have them pretty much ready
before you even get ready to flip them
[SPEAKER_01]: fill that net out as much as possible
ahead of time even if you're using less
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that are bigger just make sure that
you fill it out as much as possible that's
[SPEAKER_00]: good advice for sure now are you doing any
some folks what they'll do is defoliation
[SPEAKER_00]: so they will let their plants grow up into
the scrog or they'll basically let the veg
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants out try to fill up all the
squares right then they'll let their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants grow a little bit more then they'll
do a defoliation at some point within the
[SPEAKER_00]: first three weeks of the stretching phase
do you do anything like that at all did
[SPEAKER_01]: you defoliate at all if so when yes but
from what I've noticed the big
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliations like the massive ones where
you go in and just pull all the leaves off
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant at week three I didn't see it as
I didn't see it as necessary from doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: after doing it a couple of times I
realized that if I just periodically take
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple of handfuls of leaves out of the
room each day that I'm in there by the
[SPEAKER_01]: time that I make it to the end of flower
I'm achieving the same results the only
[SPEAKER_01]: difference is the plants don't have to
take the same amount of shock they still
[SPEAKER_01]: have those leaves to store energy they
still got those
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves to be able to do anything else that
they need to do
[SPEAKER_01]: so I figured why why do it twice when I
could just periodically pull leaves here
[SPEAKER_01]: and there the plants don't experience as
much stress and then by the end of the
[SPEAKER_01]: round I achieved the same result as people
who had to do the two massive ones I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I'm limited on time and I don't
have time to be in there four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: hours doing those leaf stretches but I got
an hour to be in there pulling off a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of those big leaves that are blocking the
canopy so I do defoliate but to an extent
[SPEAKER_01]: and I even defoliate and veg and that's
how I get the structure that I want out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant before I even get it in a flower
so I'll defoliate and veg too if I see
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's getting too thick and I want
more branching I'll defoliate and veg so
[SPEAKER_00]: you're continuing to pluck off leaves as
you see fit you know through really got it
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some people out there that say
that if you continue to pluck off leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently like daily every couple days
and you're plucking off leaves and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: stressing out to the point the plant to
the point where it become hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's true or do you think it's bro
science bro science I've never had that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen to you never had that happen to me
I think you'd be more at risk by
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliating all at once because it's a
huge shock imagine just having to take
[SPEAKER_01]: your sweater off compared to getting fully
naked which one is more of a shock to you
[SPEAKER_01]: the more of a shock is having to get rid
of everything then just having to lose one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing here periodically at a time so I
think you're you're risking the
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite trait more when you do
larger things that'll stress them out more
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think they notice a leaf or two
missing here and there because even in
[SPEAKER_01]: nature maybe a deer will come through and
eat a leaf or maybe a grasshopper nibble
[SPEAKER_01]: on the leaf so they're not immune to
losing a leaf here and there the leaves
[SPEAKER_01]: die they suck the nitrogen out of them
they fall off that that's more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: natural process then one day a plant just
wakes up at all of its leaves are gone
[SPEAKER_01]: like I think that would be way more
stressful than doing it periodically
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a good way to think about it for
sure now you mentioned earlier you
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned GML Grandmaster level I got one
of his techniques that he does now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure you're familiar with his defoliation
technique where he strips those girls
[SPEAKER_00]: basically basically naked I mean barely
anything have you ever gone that far yes
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what made that's how I got into
defoliating in the first place I was
[SPEAKER_01]: following every method from Grandmaster
level because I seen the results that he
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting behind it so I'm like man I
got to try this so for maybe two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: years I defoliated that same way I will
come in at day 21 I usually do it a little
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier maybe like day 18 and I will come
through and strip everything and then lay
[SPEAKER_01]: the net and then I just found out it makes
my life so much more difficult because I
[SPEAKER_01]: was I was knocking sites off of the plants
by trying to get the net over it and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this other stuff the plants are way too
big after they've gone through that
[SPEAKER_01]: stretch to try to fold them over now
branches start breaking pots get knocked
[SPEAKER_01]: over now you got a plant in the corner
that's kind of leaning because it was too
[SPEAKER_01]: big by the time you put the net on so I
realized that it may be a great method and
[SPEAKER_01]: his circumstances but in my circumstances
it works better to net them early and just
[SPEAKER_01]: do small defoliations throughout flower
because I want the same results that he
[SPEAKER_01]: got with with that light penetration but I
don't think I need it all at once I think
[SPEAKER_01]: over time I'm gonna get the same results
as him I'm just going about it a different
[SPEAKER_01]: way but I got that technique originally
from watching him I hadn't seen anybody do
[SPEAKER_01]: it properly prior to him now afterwards
you've seen a whole bunch of people come
[SPEAKER_01]: out with the defoliation technique and I
think the three alight book came out where
[SPEAKER_01]: they kind of went into detail on it a bit
but Grandmaster Level was the first person
[SPEAKER_01]: who I seen do it and I kind of modeled it
off of his style even my topping technique
[SPEAKER_01]: I modeled off of his style because I
noticed that there's no stunting in the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants when you just pull those top two
leaves off versus knocking that head off
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have to stop and focus on
making those top two branches that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to force it to make compared to
just letting those side shoots become tops
[SPEAKER_01]: afterwards different strokes for different
folks yeah there's so many different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to go about it because some people need
their plants to stay a little shorter so
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be better off for them to actually
top because they're not gonna stop growing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the method that I'm talking about
you'll pull those top two leaves off and
[SPEAKER_01]: the plants not gonna stop growing it will
shoot out some more side branches but it
[SPEAKER_01]: will not stop growing so if you need it to
slow down a little bit and focus more on
[SPEAKER_01]: getting wide then yes you're gonna need to
top yeah there are a lot of ways to go
[SPEAKER_00]: about it and I think there's one thing to
remind the audience is there is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways to go but there's so many
different techniques and for those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: that are tuning in on a platform where you
can leave a comment I would love to know
[SPEAKER_00]: how you do this scrub technique let us
know down in the comment section below
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is just multiple ways to go
about it yes if you're listening in you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually read in the comments and find
out different ways to do it for all the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are commenting and sharing
best practices I mean that's really one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reasons why I started this podcast is
to to really pick people's brains on their
[SPEAKER_00]: style of growing and how they go about
doing things you know why they do their
[SPEAKER_00]: things and hopefully it generates some
ideas for other people you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: greatly appreciated because for those
people coming in for the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody got different setups everybody
got different methods everybody got
[SPEAKER_01]: different end results everybody got
different spaces and requirements and
[SPEAKER_01]: limits so it's good that you're
interviewing so many different people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are doing it so many different ways there
is gonna be a way for them to find a way
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it done no matter what because of
the platform that you've given so we
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate the hell out of it absolutely
and people just have fun with it right I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean yes don't beat yourself up if the
scrub technique doesn't go go your way the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time you know you can just try again
you know yes I do have a couple more
[SPEAKER_00]: questions for you so we touched upon a
little bit earlier so when you've got that
[SPEAKER_00]: net up it's very difficult to feed or
water underneath that net training pruning
[SPEAKER_00]: that you need to do underneath that net do
you have any tips for kind of getting
[SPEAKER_01]: under that net to work do your work yes
for one get in shape yeah cuz it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: take a lot of crawling and reach it
through crevices and everything so you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be in shape to do something like
that or pick your tables up off of the
[SPEAKER_01]: floor so if you have the ceiling height so
you don't have to do as much bending over
[SPEAKER_01]: to get to everything because my setup used
to be on the floor and man it used to be
[SPEAKER_01]: hectic trying to get under there to do any
kind of lollipopping or anything so once I
[SPEAKER_01]: lifted him up and got him on trays it made
life a little bit easier but um the the
[SPEAKER_01]: watering system is almost a must if you're
gonna put a net on it if you're not in
[SPEAKER_01]: like a four by four tent where you can
kind of reach to the back with a wand or
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have big enough pots where you
could reach in there with a wand in that
[SPEAKER_01]: case yeah you might be able to get away
with putting a net on and still having
[SPEAKER_01]: access to those plants but when you're
talking about a larger number of plants
[SPEAKER_01]: over a longer amount of space you're gonna
need a watering system at that point to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to at least have the watering out the
way so you can focus more on the difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like getting through that canopy and
lollipopping that's why I try to do a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of it before flower even starts so then by
the time I'm in that second week and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know what's gonna make it and what's not I
could just go in with scissors and cut
[SPEAKER_01]: every branch off that's not gonna make it
through that net so I don't exactly have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go in and pull any little leaves
growing in or and I already took care of
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that only thing left to do is see
what branches are actually gonna make it
[SPEAKER_01]: through and what branches won't and if
they won't those branches get cut right
[SPEAKER_00]: off good tips yeah I know quite a few
people who use the wand that you mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of they're able to get in deeper
there with the wand I don't know how they
[SPEAKER_00]: connect the actual watering if they're
doing hand watering if they're connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: it and that way or not but yeah I can see
how that would make things easier yes if
[SPEAKER_01]: you got a smaller space and you could
reach to the back with that wand and maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using three or five gallon pots or
something you got full access to the to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant still compared to 16 one gallon
pots like you you're knocking stuff over
[SPEAKER_01]: they're getting hooked on the the holes is
getting hooked on the watering system
[SPEAKER_01]: that's down there the all sorts of
problems start happening snagged on
[SPEAKER_01]: branches like best to just go ahead and
hook that watering system up so I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: you can say if you don't have a watering
system it may be easier to run less plants
[SPEAKER_00]: in that yes right yes you going under them
at four plants in a four by four for
[SPEAKER_00]: example you're only having a water crawl
under there and water four plants versus
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah well plants are 16 plants however
many you do with the one gallon if I had
[SPEAKER_01]: to hand water I would probably do nine
three gallon pots three three three per
[SPEAKER_01]: row and a four by four scrog them out get
them get them set up nicely and that way I
[SPEAKER_01]: can still reach through and a three gallon
is a big enough circumference that I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to worry about knocking over too much
stuff compared to just a one gallon like
[SPEAKER_01]: those best to have the watering system if
you're gonna do those but if I was in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger setup yeah I could still get away
with a wand easily and running those
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly larger pots running nine instead
of four another you know again you kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: you should be filling up your growth space
quicker you know so yes definitely your
[SPEAKER_00]: goals is to fill up that growth space
quick and flip the flower quick you know
[SPEAKER_00]: running that nine plants would be more
beneficial than running four plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're spending longer letting
those plants grow and train and so on so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth so fill up in pots with the roots
harvesting so this is one of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can be kind of tricky right if
you your plants are stuck within these
[SPEAKER_00]: nets do you have any tips on kind of
harvesting getting them out of the nets
[SPEAKER_00]: are you chipping into you clipping away
individual branches or you cutting through
[SPEAKER_00]: the net are you just trying to rip things
out from underneath there how do you go
[SPEAKER_01]: about it I gotta I gotta cut through it
man like the the second one's pretty easy
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not exactly weave through
it it's more just for support so I can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually go in and just lift the whole top
net off roll it up and then everything
[SPEAKER_01]: just starts to topple past that point so
you got so that's when you got to go in
[SPEAKER_01]: with the little mini scissors here's a
good technique for you guys go to like the
[SPEAKER_01]: women's makeup section and they have these
little silver scissors that I think women
[SPEAKER_01]: use for I'm not sure if it's for their
eyebrows or whatever but they got these
[SPEAKER_01]: like little silver scissors those ones cut
through the net so easily compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiskars Fiskars are designed for trimming
plants they're not designed for cutting
[SPEAKER_01]: through nylon but those little silver ones
that you get out of a beauty section at
[SPEAKER_01]: like Walmart or something I'm talking
about just one little snip they pop right
[SPEAKER_01]: through that net like it's nothing so I'll
cut each plant out in a circle and then
[SPEAKER_01]: try to just keep pulling at the net and
cutting and it'll just keep coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: like a string until I got the whole net
out chop the whole plant whole hang it on
[SPEAKER_01]: a hanger move it out the way on to the
next one but yes I have to I have to cut
[SPEAKER_01]: the trellis netting out and sometimes you
get lazy and don't want to cut it all out
[SPEAKER_01]: so you'll just cut the circle cut the
plant hang it and it'll still have the net
[SPEAKER_01]: on it all the way through until trim time
yeah yeah I've done that before for sure
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also tried to you know rip rip the
plants out out from under the net and that
[SPEAKER_00]: just I mean buds get torn off trichomes
get crushed all that stuff you're looking
[SPEAKER_01]: to trade afterwards and you're just like
hey man now have you ever measured yield
[SPEAKER_00]: when doing the Scrog technique measure it
and what measurements yeah like dry yield
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean so like have you ever
filled up like a four foot by four foot
[SPEAKER_00]: space or whatever and kind of measured the
yield you got out of that you know every
[SPEAKER_00]: yield per square foot or what what do you
typically get I normally do yield per
[SPEAKER_01]: light and or by tray because each light
covers a tray so I normally do it by tray
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at the square footage and all
of that that's it gets a little bit too
[SPEAKER_01]: technical for me but um normally per four
by four string dependent anywhere between
[SPEAKER_00]: two and two point six two and two point
six pounds yep nice nice and what are you
[SPEAKER_00]: using for I know you mentioned LED up
there the scissors right there so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're on YouTube you can see the scissors
those these are the ones that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: cut through the trellis netting like it's
nothing okay all right and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: touched upon that you're using LEDs but
what what brand what model LEDs are using
[SPEAKER_01]: to get that yield well um I have one
Raymatics HA MR4 it's similar to a bar
[SPEAKER_01]: style comes in and strips that's a
thousand watt LED so that one I've hit the
[SPEAKER_01]: of course the biggest numbers on is
underneath that one but mainly HLGM
[SPEAKER_00]: everything okay and then are you
supplementing co2 in that growth space too
[SPEAKER_01]: or no you know what last round I hit my
biggest harvest to date room-wise with no
[SPEAKER_01]: co2 but I'd normally yes I would use a co2
burner because the burner comes in handy
[SPEAKER_01]: because come wintertime I need heat so one
of the great ways to add heat since the
[SPEAKER_01]: LEDs don't throw any heat out is the co2
burner so you heard it here first folks
[SPEAKER_00]: co2 does nothing for your plants I think
it's I think it's still up in the air
[SPEAKER_01]: because they do well outdoor at a natural
350 to 400 PPMs of unlimited co2 and then
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor we're pumping up with 1,500 and
they're still getting bigger outdoor so
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering how much of a difference
does the co2 actually make now this run
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna run co2 again and I'm gonna see
how much changes and how much benefit the
[SPEAKER_01]: co2 has versus last round not using it
with the exact same setup so I almost get
[SPEAKER_01]: to do a side-by-side with co2 and without
co2 and if the increase is so minimal then
[SPEAKER_01]: it just won't be worth it you almost
better off doing an intake outtake at that
[SPEAKER_00]: point got it yeah I'd be interested to
hear your findings on that one I do know
[SPEAKER_00]: that there have been quite a few studies
in the past I mean we've been growing for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long and stuff like that I think the
general consensus is that pumping co2 in
[SPEAKER_00]: there and getting your level stable you
see a significant difference in yield now
[SPEAKER_00]: let's you know let's put it to the test
right yes and try it out and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens yeah and I say if it makes a
difference for you and something else I
[SPEAKER_01]: never went with the standard everybody
else went with the 1,500 or 1,250 PPMs of
[SPEAKER_01]: co2 I literally just want to double what
the ambient is because I feel like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be a cap out at some point because
this plant isn't designed to take in this
[SPEAKER_01]: level of co2 it has never been designed to
take in this level of co2 so double
[SPEAKER_01]: ambient to me is more than enough so if
ambient is around 350 to 400 then 800 750
[SPEAKER_01]: should be more than enough for them I
think once you start hitting over a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand you're not gonna see much
difference between 800 and 1,500 save
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself some co2 and then you also got a
factor in the law of minimum right which
[SPEAKER_00]: is basically you can you can pump up 1,500
co2 but if you don't have your temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity nutrition dial then it's gonna
operate that at that lower level that
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum level right so it all needs to be
in sync so yeah so wrapping things up how
[SPEAKER_00]: can listeners find you and what do you
have upcoming in the future yes they could
[SPEAKER_01]: either find me on beast coast grow 420 on
YouTube beast coast grow 420 on IG or the
[SPEAKER_01]: green table podcast on YouTube and for the
future we got some new setups coming some
[SPEAKER_01]: new rooms coming a lot more soil talk for
people because I'm learning that a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more people are going towards the organic
methods but they're usually buying and
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in pots and everything because
they don't know how to repair the native
[SPEAKER_01]: soil that they have to be able to use the
ground that's already given to them so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna focus a little bit more on trying to
get people to repair the natural soils
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have to be able to use those
versus having to spend the money to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: these super soils and make them and
throwing them away each season or
[SPEAKER_01]: composting them or whatever no I'm gonna
show you how to make the ground that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have good enough for you to pop anything
into it and it'll start growing right away
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to do more production talk for
people for the people that are looking in
[SPEAKER_01]: to get to more of the production side of
things I want to be able to show people a
[SPEAKER_01]: more efficient way of scaling up from from
where you are because most people are
[SPEAKER_01]: focused on scaling up so as you start to
scale up I like to go over the problems
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could have in the easiest ways
around them so that's mainly to go moving
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future helping people sounds like
you got a lot of good valuable information
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up in the future so I'm definitely
definitely looking forward to tuning in on
[SPEAKER_00]: that one you do have a YouTube channel
which I will link down in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below for sure so head on over
there give him a sub and then also the
[SPEAKER_00]: green table podcast so that's something I
tune in from time to time sometimes I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you do it on what Sunday nights
right Sunday's 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eastern Sunday's 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tune in sometimes and you know sometimes
I'm like just really stressed and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: I met message you about this one there was
one time I was so super stressed turned it
[SPEAKER_00]: on and the chill vibe that you guys have I
mean you're so casual you're laid-back you
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there's so many different
ways to do it it just it took away some my
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety you know and so if you guys like
those those chill style podcasts where
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't you know people more
open-minded understand that there's so
[SPEAKER_00]: many different ways to go about it and
different techniques and sharing best
[SPEAKER_00]: practices all that stuff you know I
definitely recommend giving his podcast a
[SPEAKER_00]: try and I'll link the channel down in the
description section below as well thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you well Beast Coast Grower this has been
