[SPEAKER_01]: Coming up on garden talk soon as a root
busts out and exposed to the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting colonized by bacteria So
whether it's negative bad bacteria like
[SPEAKER_01]: pythium root rots or it's positive
bacteria like bacillus that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna feed the plant You've got to give
some kind of place for those guys to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: 60% cocoa 20% pearl like 20% castings and
then I will put a little bit of rock dust
[SPEAKER_01]: in there like that Azomite or just glacial
rock dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's very specific micro rice That work
for very specific plants, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so like you'll see ectomycorrhizae on some
labels unless you're growing pine trees
[SPEAKER_01]: Ectomycorrhizae ain't gonna help you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people to have success You can grow
the biggest damn tree you want but if it
[SPEAKER_01]: wilts on you know Five days before harvest
because you forgot the water it guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up everybody feed that don't know
me my name is Chris aka mr Grow it and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're tuned into the garden talk podcast

[SPEAKER_02]: I interview Scotty real from the dude grow
show He has been gardening for 30 years
[SPEAKER_02]: and he grows a variety of plants such as
bamboo palm trees medicinal and hot
[SPEAKER_02]: peppers I'm sure many of you know him from
his show the dude grow show which is on
[SPEAKER_02]: YouTube and on podcast platforms in this
episode He talks about growing in cocoa

[SPEAKER_02]: Alright now let's get into the episode and
We are back Welcome to the garden talk
[SPEAKER_02]: podcast today.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am joined with Scotty real from the dude
grows show.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I'm psyched man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really psyched to be here hanging out
with another content creator I dig your
[SPEAKER_01]: style dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dig your style.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Man, it's an honor to have you
on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you're somebody who I've looked up
to I mean you guys have been around I
[SPEAKER_02]: think I first started watching dude grow
show back in like 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe you guys started in 2013 So and
that was once you guys said audio only
[SPEAKER_01]: remember those days Yeah, I ran into dude
at a party and he says I'm starting my own
[SPEAKER_01]: growers podcast And then I was like no,
I'm doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw Joe Rogan first It was like the you
know a couple couple months after Rogan
[SPEAKER_01]: came out.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's telling everybody to do it and sure
enough it was so much fun it was honestly
[SPEAKER_01]: a dude and I with all this stuff was I
don't know maybe was in 2013 everything's
[SPEAKER_01]: blowing up here in Colorado and We're
talking about on the phone for an hour
[SPEAKER_01]: hour and a half a night.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like, this is the show This is it
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put mics in front of us what
audacity and it's funny that was when like
[SPEAKER_01]: the Early few hundred versions of that or
shows of that is like us alone Doing what
[SPEAKER_01]: we can with with you know with the
computer then Sean showed up grew Guru
[SPEAKER_01]: showed up about three four hundred
episodes in and we actually got to where
[SPEAKER_01]: we could do video You know, this actually
was a huge upgrade for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what a joy Yeah, the progression has
been awesome over the years Just kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: see you guys get better and better and
then continuous improvement and the show
[SPEAKER_02]: it is today is just it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Definitely appreciate you guys doing
that for us in the community here because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's definitely entertaining and it brings
a lot of Education to the community as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be right back at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hanging out last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I watched Vader and the painted lady with
just man There's not that much great
[SPEAKER_01]: content to absorb at least not if you turn
on the TV So YouTube is that double-edged
[SPEAKER_01]: sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to watch yourself on there But
I'll be damned that there isn't a ton of
[SPEAKER_01]: great information to consume or just
people to hang out with the idea with our
[SPEAKER_01]: show Is to have people to hang out with
hopefully you got some like-minded folks
[SPEAKER_01]: that are hanging out half the time We're
talking growing and half the time we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just talking culture, you know I have
someone to hang out with whether you're in
[SPEAKER_01]: your grow or in the green house or in your
car Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So before we get to our topic today,
we're going to talk about kind of the
[SPEAKER_02]: easiest way to grow simplify growing Can
you tell us a little bit about yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: and kind of how you got into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: I got into gardening by Trying to make a
better product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you the medicine that I that was out
there Just it didn't even remind me of a
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminded me of a product and I thought
to myself, how can I Comes with seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how can I do a better job with
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I make better medicine for me and
to share with my friends?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is medicine to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It always has been so Yeah, that brought
me to a heck of a long journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started in 1991 basically learning
you'll go into the the grocery store
[SPEAKER_01]: buying a hypon X, you know potting mix
what you could find at Kmart or Walmart,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it was back then and You know
literally just just starting from scratch
[SPEAKER_01]: like that and it took It was actually a
journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started with putting a seed in a you
know in some soil And then I started
[SPEAKER_01]: getting enamored with the technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there's you know, is this There's a
machine that will grow this for you and
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll grow these, you know, beautiful
beautiful quality flowers and that uh You
[SPEAKER_01]: can't really treat flowers or something
living like a machine, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it took me 20 20 years to figure that out
You know that I would grow in deep water
[SPEAKER_01]: culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would grow in all these different
Unnatural systems that treated a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: like a machine and I would grow decent
quality, but it just wouldn't it was just
[SPEAKER_01]: missing something and Yeah, when I learned
how to treat plants like plants like
[SPEAKER_01]: something living, you know Whether it's
more like a pet than a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really able to to get better that's
when I really hit my stride of growing and
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I've been doing it was 30 years
Jesus 30 years, man It's a long time for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure Yeah, and it's been an evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I am I was originally growing
medicinal herbs and then I kind of got
[SPEAKER_01]: enamored by I went to I bought my first
house and I went to go buy a Privacy fence
[SPEAKER_01]: and somebody says you know what if you
actually put bamboo up It's natural and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a natural privacy fence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like bamboo who the hell heard of
that, you know, I heard of palm trees I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: from South Florida, but a bamboo was a
niche and I ended up buying 20 acres
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the very simple lessons that I knew
about growing from You know from growing
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal herbs and bringing them in the
bamboo and it was kind of funny I really
[SPEAKER_01]: actually got my butt handed to me because
I would go like first thing I wanted to do
[SPEAKER_01]: was put 20 acres on liquid feed You know,
just like we do we go buy bottled
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients with they were like you're gonna
go broke buddy You know, what do you want?
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn a thousand liters of three containers
of liquid feed so very quickly you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: learn how how things Scale up and what
works and what doesn't work in those
[SPEAKER_01]: situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a heck of an education man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool I didn't know that
about you So let me ask you, you know a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people want different things out of
growing right like some people I think a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of people jump to the assumption that
everything's about yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody just wants the biggest possible
flowers It's not really the case for
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some people that chase after taste
smell there's some people I know I
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned in a past podcast one of things
I strive for is efficiency having a
[SPEAKER_02]: deficient grow For you, what's the goal
with growing to get the harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: I Say that really it's a it's a tie
between to get clean medicine for me and
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends to enjoy But when I'm talking
to other people about growing even when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking about myself it is to get to
harvest it is not that easy to Provide
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants with a hundred hundred and ten
hundred and fifteen days worth of very
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent environment food watering IPM
all that stuff to go for you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know three months three and a half
months It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you're just hand watering and
you miss What two days, you know shit I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't feeling so well a couple days ago
and I just didn't have the energy to get
[SPEAKER_01]: up and water my plants and I was like if I
don't get up and water my plants is 1150,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's 1135 my Lights go off at
midnight and I better go out there Water
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're gonna all die, you know,
it's like it's not that easy to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred hundred twenty days of success So
that is what I really tried the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: growing simplified thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want people to have success You can grow
the biggest damn tree you want but if it
[SPEAKER_01]: wilts on you know Five days before harvest
because you forgot the water it guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: That really is the goal growing big plants
and growing all that stuff is really a
[SPEAKER_01]: matter of strain now what You pick if you
want to pick I don't know that I still
[SPEAKER_01]: make big bud You know our blue dream or
gorilla glue one of those giant ones you
[SPEAKER_01]: can grow you can pick what you want But
there's all sorts of things some people
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do that Some people just want what
I want which is to share great medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: with our friends our family those in need
It's it happens here in Colorado and it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a joy and it is such a different
experience than it is in commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: markets I'll say that makes sense All
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let's get into indoor gardening and
your style of keeping things easy Let's
[SPEAKER_02]: start with the medium.
[SPEAKER_02]: What medium do you like to grow in when
you're keeping things simple?
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent and cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love telling people about cocoa Cocoa
core.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, it is It's renewable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was in Costa Rica recently and between
there and Florida You'll never see so many
[SPEAKER_01]: coconuts coconut palm very easy to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take a ton of resources grows
the coconut the world's biggest Seed first
[SPEAKER_01]: of all, I think that's a trip But when you
peel that thing all that pith and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that comes off it is great growing
media I mean if you think about it that
[SPEAKER_01]: just came out of the earth You know that
was just growing your growing media was
[SPEAKER_01]: just grown as opposed to peat where I used
to live a Have a place in Florida when I
[SPEAKER_01]: would drive by there was a peat bog and
they would actually be mining the peat
[SPEAKER_01]: They would actually have a bulldozer go in
and they were tearing out the earth that
[SPEAKER_01]: peat takes you know millions of years to
Become peat and it kind of if I got my
[SPEAKER_01]: choice of a year to get coconut husks,
you know out of Off a coconut or you know
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of years of peat that they're
mining from the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather do the coconut but that's just
That's just honestly ethically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the performance is way better
Cocoa core holds moisture and air way
[SPEAKER_01]: better than peat does peat will compact
and it's really hard To get a lot of air
[SPEAKER_01]: into peat or at least you better aerate it
well as to where cocoa you can take just
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa with no aeration no perlite anything
like that and use it as a media and it
[SPEAKER_01]: works awesome and so it it holds a lot of
air, but the best thing about it is Even
[SPEAKER_01]: when you let it dry it rewets very easily
I don't know if you've ever used I'm sure
[SPEAKER_01]: you've used peat foot for the listeners
Pete is one of those things if you screw
[SPEAKER_01]: up and let it get a little bit too dry as
to where you can kind of see the You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's pulled away from the side of the
container you are gonna have a difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: time or it's gonna take you a very long
time of just dropping a tiny bit of water
[SPEAKER_01]: on there letting it absorb until that peat
rewets something called hydrophobic it
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes scared of water man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just so much easier to rewet cocoa
and Yeah, I love cocoa when I first came
[SPEAKER_01]: to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thoroughly intimidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It came here in 2009 I was to backpack
days and you really had to have your act
[SPEAKER_01]: together And when I came here,
I looked for anything I could I talked to
[SPEAKER_01]: my buddy Cory over a way to grow is The
owner there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me any advantage I can and he said
can of cocoa can of A&B and 10-gallon
[SPEAKER_01]: smart pots Pretty damn easy system and you
pour equal parts A&B in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know You test it to a thousand ppm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make sure your pH is okay You pour
that water on there a couple times a week
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get the harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty damn cool So you're using
the bagged cocoa instead of the bricked
[SPEAKER_02]: cocoa and then and then hydrating or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can talk about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried all sorts of ways I have
definitely ordered the brick cocoa off
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazon have been like, yeah, come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see how cheap I'm telling you I want
to see how Inexpensive simple we can make
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for people so that somebody can
say I've got a balcony or I've got a porch
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've always wanted to grow something I
tell you what this looks so damn easy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know your water it For some of these
bottom feeding buckets your water once a
[SPEAKER_01]: week or you water it every 10 days I can
leave it outside on my patio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know that and I'll actually grow
something that I can use That's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: what it that is the the message that I
want to put out there You know if I can
[SPEAKER_01]: get if I can inspire someone me and my
buddy soup the gardener shout out the
[SPEAKER_01]: growers love calm He's a really smart guy
really great with organics We want
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone to have a two by two tent whether
it's a two by two or four by four,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you just have one plant even if it's
just to Experience what it's like to care
[SPEAKER_01]: for a plant say, you know I don't know if
it's as intense as caring for a dog or
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe similar to a cat I would say,
you know But man to care for something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really does uh It really does
something to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely now with the cocoa Are you
amending anything in it to begin or you
[SPEAKER_02]: just taking it straight out of the bag and
then putting into the container?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know in the beginning I was just
taking it straight out of the bag or is
[SPEAKER_01]: relying on it becomes really nutrient
dependent I think when you do that when I
[SPEAKER_01]: bought Kana Nutrients, I definitely bought
Kana cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe there's something I'm not a
chemist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never I've never even made it to
chemistry class, but From a guru grow guru
[SPEAKER_01]: is a my co-host on the do grow show He's
the guy that that went to college for all
[SPEAKER_01]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different buffering agents and
code Coco has a bunch of potassium in it
[SPEAKER_01]: So they they buffer it and so it works
with the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why when you get a nutrient line,
they usually have a cocoa I That's where I
[SPEAKER_01]: started with of course when you when
you're baking a cake you start out with a
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you start saying let me put a
little more sugar in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me put some purple food color No,
I'm just kidding, but you start with a
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after like I like cocoa it didn't
remind me of soil though when I would look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it I Started learning about soil
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started learning that And nature fills a
vacuum so I would have problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried all sorts of stuff deep water
culture straight-up cocoa, which is which
[SPEAKER_01]: is hydroponics and what I find is when I
didn't have a real media in there when I
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have something that at least
resembled soil I left myself open to
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left myself open to pythium just
different root rots.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know what they were I just
know I'd show up one day and one of my
[SPEAKER_01]: plants was just dead dead from the inside,
you know, so I was just Trying to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: that out and what I learned was like I
said nature fills a vacuum if I cut my
[SPEAKER_01]: finger and I Sterilize, you know sterilize
the cut and then I sterilize some soil
[SPEAKER_01]: like I just bake it bring, you know Bring
it out of the of the oven where it's baked
[SPEAKER_01]: and sterilized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stick my finger in there My finger
is not going to stay sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna there's gonna be infection
pathogens that come where do they come
[SPEAKER_01]: from?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know bacteria is everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my point is it's difficult here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible to keep something
completely sterile I mean it takes a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of Equipment to do that, you know,
it's like a scientific thing as soon as
[SPEAKER_01]: you bring things out as soon as a root You
know bust out and exposed to the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's getting colonized by bacteria So
whether it's negative bad bacteria like
[SPEAKER_01]: pythium root rots or it's positive
bacteria like bacillus that are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: going to feed the plant You've got to give
some kind of place for those guys to grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know those microbes who's living so
microbes to grow rock wool Pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult rock was like spun stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can maybe get mycorrhizae on there But
it really doesn't want to colonize on rock
[SPEAKER_01]: wool on the expanded cocoa the expanded
pellets the clay pellets It's really
[SPEAKER_01]: difficult to grow any kind of beneficial
bacteria on there So the only things that
[SPEAKER_01]: will grow on there or what loves to grow
on there and colonizes the bad stuff the
[SPEAKER_01]: root eating stuff the pythium and the and
the rots and what's not so I Really
[SPEAKER_01]: started learning That the key to whatever
you're growing is to add some content to
[SPEAKER_01]: emulate soil to add some kind of organic
material to it So for me, it was earthworm
[SPEAKER_01]: castings earthworm castings loaded with
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either loaded with microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's dead microbes It's a home for
microbes and even when those microbes die,
[SPEAKER_01]: they just turn into soil organic matter
Just just more organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what soil makes is it makes organic
matter it breaks down, you know leaf
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue and whatnot and It takes that
organic matter but turns it in a soil
[SPEAKER_01]: organic matter food for the microbes home
for the microbes So that that's what I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started adding more and more castings in
I'm to about 20% castings to about Trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to think I want to say it's about 67 about
60 I don't really measure that hard,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I might forget as I'm dumping
the bucket but about 60% castings 20%
[SPEAKER_01]: pearlite Shoot I'm forgetting something I
know I'll put a little bit of biochar and
[SPEAKER_01]: hang on I wrote this down 60% cocoa 20%
pearlite 20% castings and then I will put
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of rock dust in there like
that Azomite or just glacial rock dust and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that is it's just a little bit of
micronutrients in there that the plant can
[SPEAKER_01]: access or the microbes can access Just a
tiny bit of that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need literally parts per billion of
some of some of those things And then one
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I've been playing with is biochar
You've been messing with biochar lately?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've had my hands on biochar I mixed
it in on a couple different grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that stuff Yeah, I've been getting
a shout out to biochar now, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado company that actually makes a
really good biochar You can kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it looks like charcoal or you
know something that came out of the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the fire But there's a beautiful little
pelletized activated biochar and what that
[SPEAKER_01]: does it's just got a bunch of little holes
just like the carbon filters Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The carbon filters have a bunch of they're
very porous the carbon is in there so as
[SPEAKER_01]: the Odors go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're captured.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's there's just a whole bunch of air in
there Well, all those air spaces can also
[SPEAKER_01]: be used as homes for microbes So by just
adding a little bit of biochar in there a
[SPEAKER_01]: at air rates, but be it is such a great
great home for microbes So yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's kind of what I've been
playing with lately and just been having
[SPEAKER_01]: great results man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome Yeah, I looked at one of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched one of your recent videos and
man You grow some massive plants indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at I don't know how tall you
are But these plants were had to have been
[SPEAKER_02]: just as tall as you if not taller than you
I'm only four foot tall.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean there I knew that you're not
just kidding But you go some big plants I
[SPEAKER_02]: was wondering what what size containers
are those plants in those are in five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon hempy buckets and I'll get in that
in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason I grow plants is just because
of of how the laws work or the reason I
[SPEAKER_01]: grow very large plants is is how the laws
work You know, I want to show people that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can take a two by two or two by four
tent and it's gonna take you you know 100
[SPEAKER_01]: 120 days whatever it is three four months
To get through to that harvest but that
[SPEAKER_01]: that is a worthy investment that you can
make that worth your while that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: Create make your own very clean medicinal
or medicine without going to a store
[SPEAKER_01]: without You know having to you know
Venture in the unknown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking medicine here I mean
you can wink about it all you want people
[SPEAKER_01]: might and you know might make them feel
good But this is real medicine for people
[SPEAKER_01]: and especially for sick people If they're
inhaling, you know say somebody wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that they got the harvest so
they sprayed Eagle 20 on there which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide that's for ornamental use only
or they had spider mites and they didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: do the right thing or you know didn't you
know, maybe they needed a colder crop and
[SPEAKER_01]: they didn't and he just sprayed some
Poison and middle cloprid sport poison on
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: None of those things have been tested for
us to a eat I mean, maybe they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: tested for us to eat but they have not
been tested for us to smoke You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's a really frightening thing and
that's what makes me want to want to
[SPEAKER_01]: control my own Supply chain, I guess,
you know in the supply chain for other
[SPEAKER_01]: people who I help Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_02]: So five gallon empty buckets.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk about the empty buckets in
detail in a little bit but I know you do
[SPEAKER_02]: start in the Small solo cups and then you
kind of you must transplant up eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: into those containers Can you talk about
your you know when you transplant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have a kind of unique system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to I hope it's not too
complicated I'll try to share it but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a it's a 12 plant system.
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically has four stages So the idea
is to harvest three nice plants a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little six by twelve So it's
something that I think people could
[SPEAKER_01]: accomplish with a couple tenths or
something like that I have a two foot by
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry have a six foot by two foot veg
So just a length of the width of a closet
[SPEAKER_01]: and then two foot is my veg and in there I
grow solo cups I have a couple mothers
[SPEAKER_01]: actually use a shelving unit and I grow a
couple mothers on the bottom I will
[SPEAKER_01]: propagate those into cups just into the
cup and cup method.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them grow for about it's all
predicated on a month So I'll take the
[SPEAKER_01]: clone let it grow in the cup for a month
Then I'll transplant that to a three
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon keep it in veg for another month
Then after that I transplant it to a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon which is called a hempy bucket or a
sip bucket It's basically a bottom feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: bucket just a little bit more forgiving
with the water I'll transplant it to a
[SPEAKER_01]: five gallon and I move it into flowering
very shortly afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea is every month I'm harvesting
three plants and moving three new plants
[SPEAKER_01]: in the flowering and it's for a six by
twelve It is a yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean that that system will really push
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep on forgetting the original
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was transplant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Solo and usually I try to do month
intervals solo to a three gallon to a five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon out to flowering 60 days and
they're gone and every month I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: continuing to do that and it's a perpetual
harvest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotcha that makes sense that's a pretty
cool system that you got in place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying man I'm trying to do this to
where I use slow release fertilizers where
[SPEAKER_01]: I incorporate just a simple slow release
fertilizer in there I mean it is gonna say
[SPEAKER_01]: it's so easy that my friends could take
care of it while I'm on vacation but I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we're going to talk about
next you know we talked about your mix
[SPEAKER_02]: your initial mix kind of getting going
what containers to use transplanting now
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients let's talk about what are you
using for nutrients base nutrients
[SPEAKER_02]: additives microbial inoculants can you
talk to us about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah I mean I've been growing since 1991
so I've been through the mix and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if a ton has changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three part general hydroponics I heard you
and I think it was painted lady laughing
[SPEAKER_01]: about back in the day like that was that
was the only option you went to the girls
[SPEAKER_01]: story you got three part general
hydroponics it worked it left you wide
[SPEAKER_01]: open for pathogens it was the kind of
thing that it wasn't kind of addressing
[SPEAKER_01]: the roots or any soil organic matter or
that kind of stuff it was basically either
[SPEAKER_01]: a rock wool it was designed for a rock
wool slab system or hydroponics but it
[SPEAKER_01]: worked you know it worked it was fairly no
frills but then I started going to a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more boutique stuff I've tried
I'll skip fast forward to when I went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado started doing a little bit more
boutique stuff I think that was the Kana A
[SPEAKER_01]: &B which I think I would consider that a
boutique brand though sure yes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly not you know bargain basement
price but went to that hung out there for
[SPEAKER_01]: a few years as far as a very simple system
goes I mean they are by no means a sponsor
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything like that but just Kana is
clean product you put equal parts A&B in
[SPEAKER_01]: there you use the match it up with their
cocoa and it's pretty easy to have success
[SPEAKER_01]: you know as long as you water them and
have good watering practices which I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you ever talk about that it's so
damn easy to teach people how to water you
[SPEAKER_01]: pick the plant up when it's saturated and
then you go back and you water when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: about half that weight I mean I love being
able to cause over water and under water
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's those are things that keep
people from getting the harvest and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they end up throwing the equipment in the
you know in the closet and there's their
[SPEAKER_02]: growing career down the tube yeah that's a
that's a good way to put it I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard it that way before to saturate
it and then to would you say let it go to
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway and then water it's about halfway
you know you won't get in trouble come
[SPEAKER_01]: play with it there but yeah I mean that's
a just a simple rule of thumb I like to I
[SPEAKER_02]: like to talk to people about and that's
specifically in cocoa in your method right
[SPEAKER_02]: so if soil you'd probably do something
different right it's a rule of thumb you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's meant to be it put it this way
it'll probably keep you keep you from
[SPEAKER_01]: grossly over watering whatever you're
growing that is the biggest problem I
[SPEAKER_01]: think is people want to love things to
death you know for me I would do you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I had the general hydroponics three-part
and then I would get root rot oh my gosh
[SPEAKER_01]: what can I do for that man I better go get
some hydro garden and put that on there I
[SPEAKER_01]: better go get this product and put it on
man they're still not looking good let me
[SPEAKER_01]: put some more on more on and you're a
moron for putting more on you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: listen to the plant man the plant you
can't just keep what's like if I'm just so
[SPEAKER_01]: stuffed I just got back from the buffet
and I feel terrible and I'm like I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: terrible guys and you go eat more here
here's a steak it's not gonna help man so
[SPEAKER_01]: actually that's where it comes back to
understand that plants are alive and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that they need balance they
need the right proportions of air water
[SPEAKER_01]: the carbon dioxide in that air which
really is the macronutrient air water and
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit of nutrients I mean just
that just they don't need and when I say a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit thousand eight hundred nine
hundred parts per million but compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: how much carbon it's taking in and it's
not that much you know an air and water
[SPEAKER_01]: it's using the nutrients are just a little
a little bit there so you following their
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding schedule for that just doing like
a reduced dose and then are you doing any
[SPEAKER_01]: additives or just the base nutrients you
know this was a bit ago I will tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of I forgot my last year or so I
did want to get some content so I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing pretty good with whether it's kind
of A&B that kind of stuff I was doing
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good with it commercially no
complaints was I going to win any
[SPEAKER_01]: competitions with it no and when I started
talking you know start talking to really
[SPEAKER_01]: great growers I was like hey man how can I
step it up a bit more and you know one guy
[SPEAKER_01]: his name is Jaren from New Millennium you
should actually see if you can have him on
[SPEAKER_01]: the show he's a wealth of knowledge but he
would come over and he would just show me
[SPEAKER_01]: that he was at the next level and I asked
him he said how do I get there I usually
[SPEAKER_01]: ask a lot of growers when they show up and
they're at that nine ten to where I'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: salivating like what's going on there what
are you doing and so Jaren gave me a
[SPEAKER_01]: unique answer he says it's the nutrients
he's got New Millennium is quite a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: different to what I'm used to I'm used to
slow release fertilizer that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate in and kind of get a couple of
additives from there just just to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: tweak it his is I want to say it's nine or
ten bottles and there are some interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: things there but you control the how mag
you control you can add more P and K if
[SPEAKER_01]: you want there's fulvics there's that
winter frost product which is an actually
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting thing actually that's a good
tip is winter frost even if you don't use
[SPEAKER_01]: New Millennium that product will make your
plants all finish different strains finish
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time it's really valuable for
someone like me that's doing perpetual
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest things got to be out of there in a
month so I was playing with that but for
[SPEAKER_01]: me I'm not trying to I had to make a
decision am I really trying to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: top-notch you know 10 flower that's gonna
win competitions ain't gonna have people
[SPEAKER_01]: beat my door down no I'm really not I
don't have a lot of ego in it I just want
[SPEAKER_01]: good medicine I want people to grow good
medicine that they can enjoy that their
[SPEAKER_01]: friends can enjoy the more the better the
more people that enjoy good medicine the
[SPEAKER_01]: better this world is going to be so it
doesn't have to be nine or ten he can grow
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant that's a six or a seven and that's
and that's great you know for you and your
[SPEAKER_01]: friends it's great for me that's great for
the world man so yeah I was just thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's a little bit complicated for me
it was nine bottles and so I went back to
[SPEAKER_01]: just my slow release fertilizer controlled
release fertilizers gotcha gotcha and then
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the products which I assume is in
your garden there's something I got right
[SPEAKER_02]: here so recharge these are microbes and
you are the owner of this company right
[SPEAKER_02]: can you talk to us a little bit about
recharge and kind of how you incorporate
[SPEAKER_01]: in your garden yeah absolutely it brings
such a smile on my face that product does
[SPEAKER_01]: that was something I formulated with I was
in the bamboo and learning at the bamboo
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery there's 20 I have 20 acres tens of
thousands of plants and the fertilizer
[SPEAKER_01]: costs on there are unbelievable I mean
you're talking you know six digits in
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizer to keep everything really
pumping out of there a year and I started
[SPEAKER_01]: hearing about red tide I'm from Florida
red tide the fish were dying it has a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: to do with the sugar corporations
releasing their fertilizer into the oceans
[SPEAKER_01]: and it made me not I'm a farmer I have 20
acres I'm spending a hundred plus thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars on fertilizer every year I am part
of that problem so I started figuring out
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have the organic I've got like 2%
organic matter in my soil there's no way
[SPEAKER_01]: that I could have a could do what I do
just using organics it would take me 20
[SPEAKER_01]: years to build that soil and there's no
way I could have production on it like
[SPEAKER_01]: that so I'm kind of locked in I'm in sand
so with my bamboo nursery I'm locked into
[SPEAKER_01]: using synthetic nutrients so if I'm locked
into that at least let me keep them in my
[SPEAKER_01]: field at least let me keep them at the
root zone and that's where I really
[SPEAKER_01]: started studying first you know the first
microbe that everybody learns about or
[SPEAKER_01]: that I learned about was mycorrhizae which
is that that funny sounding word it's
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially a root fungus though and I
don't have anything but gross analogies
[SPEAKER_01]: but if you get a fungus on your finger now
and your fingernail grows does the fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: just magically go away no it keeps on you
know keeps on growing on the fingernail as
[SPEAKER_01]: it grows well that's a pathogenic fungus
now let's talk about a beneficial fungus
[SPEAKER_01]: let's talk about something that
mycorrhizae is a fungus that's actually a
[SPEAKER_01]: coating I think of a bare wire and I think
how dangerous a bare wire is and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: think about a coating if you just put a
coating on that wire and that's what it
[SPEAKER_01]: does it coats the roots except it's like a
fuzzy coating and it has all the the
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae has this fuzz it has these
root hairs that come out and that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient is absorbed and the nutrient
is absorbed on those root hairs so not
[SPEAKER_01]: only do you create much massive thousands
of thousand times more absorption points
[SPEAKER_01]: for the nutrient but you've also increased
the whole surface area of that root so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's huge man so finding the only thing is
that mycorrhizae like glomis and erratus
[SPEAKER_01]: there's very specific mycorrhizae that
work for very specific plants you know so
[SPEAKER_01]: like you'll see ectomycorrhizae on some
labels unless you're growing pine trees
[SPEAKER_01]: ectomycorrhizae ain't going to help you
you can see 60 different species of
[SPEAKER_01]: mycorrhizae if you're growing you know
specific plants you know specific
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal plants you need erratus that's
the one that that forms that bond so there
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot of a lot of fluff on a lot of
labels and whatnot but that's the one you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to look for what I really learned
about what keeps the nutrient in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: though is the bacteria another gross
analogy that I got I don't know I need
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody to clean up my analogies but when
you wake up in the morning you got stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: stuck on your teeth that's bacteria stuck
on your teeth you can't just wash them out
[SPEAKER_01]: with water you can't just take a glass of
water and be like alright I'm all good I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: ready to go to my day you'll have a lot of
bacteria still stuck on your breath you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to brush them off you have to
actually take something you know a brush
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know with some toothpaste some you
know aggregate and brush those things off
[SPEAKER_01]: because they have the glomulin the
bacteria make this glomulin they stick so
[SPEAKER_01]: they stick to your teeth guess what else
the bacteria will stick to roots soil
[SPEAKER_01]: particles specifically in the soil if
you've got these sticky bacteria things
[SPEAKER_01]: can get absorbed which you know it goes
inside or adsorbed which it just sticks
[SPEAKER_01]: adsorbed just a D instead of a B and it
means it just sticks to the outside yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of being on the inside yeah these
bacteria get these these nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: particles even he said synthetic neutral
particles they stick to them even if they
[SPEAKER_01]: die in the soil whether they move to the
root zone or they just die in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: these basically it's like a sink it's like
your soil is the battery my buddy soup the
[SPEAKER_01]: gardener invented that your soil is the
battery and the more nutrient you can hold
[SPEAKER_01]: in it whether it's through usually through
bacteria is the way you or soil organic
[SPEAKER_01]: matter is the way you're going to hold it
but the stronger your soil is you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: more nutrient dense your soil is and I
also the last analogy I got is if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking think about cocoa core or
something like that are you thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever soil it's when we use this
synthetic nutrients they're salts right
[SPEAKER_01]: there that's what they are the hydro ionic
form of nutrients whether it's general
[SPEAKER_01]: hydroponics or any of the brands they're
all salt base when you go to the beach and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know salt all over you and you wash
off on those showers it's complete the
[SPEAKER_01]: opposite experience of brushing your teeth
right you don't brush stuff on all you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to do is let that water touch you the salt
runs right off that's why it's so easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: leach soils that's why when you deal with
soils without microbes they tell you to
[SPEAKER_01]: water till 10% run off and all that stuff
because they're trying to just very easily
[SPEAKER_01]: all it takes 10% extra water to wash all
those salts out and where are they going
[SPEAKER_01]: now they go down the drain if you're in a
commercial you know facility 20 acres or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is they go down and they
become somebody else's problem and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're buying those for 30 40 50 dollars a
gallon why not keep them in the root zone
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep them where the plants can use
them that makes sense for sure yeah a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of good information there there's some
definitely some things I didn't know so
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely appreciate you dropping those
knowledge bombs there for us but recharge
[SPEAKER_02]: great product I am I've been using this
since 2016 in my garden off and on I need
[SPEAKER_02]: to use you know if I use the same thing
over and over again in my videos my people
[SPEAKER_02]: just get bored so I've been using this
kind of off and on in videos this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I really get a lot of value
out of in my garden I mean has everything
[SPEAKER_02]: from beneficials you know bacteria
mycorrhizae, kelp, molasses, humic and
[SPEAKER_02]: fulvic acids and even amino acids so it's
really loaded with a bunch of good stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: in there definitely recommend it for sure
you mind if I say something about that go
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead sure okay see I even asked before I
started again when I got into the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: everything was separate there are separate
bottles you know for A and B and fulvic
[SPEAKER_01]: and humic I remember when I hope it's okay
to say this no begrudging to anyone that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in marketing products but when
advanced nutrients came in there was 30
[SPEAKER_01]: bottles I want to say maybe it was 20
bottles and it was everything was priced
[SPEAKER_01]: 30 40 dollars I don't even think it was a
gallon she was expensive and I just
[SPEAKER_01]: started thinking to myself this starting
to smell bullshit here man I have a 20
[SPEAKER_01]: acre bamboo nursery and not even the world
I know some world-class growers of some
[SPEAKER_01]: very hard-to-grow ornamentals nobody's
using 20 bottles so I just started
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about it and I said well what can
you combine you know I started can you
[SPEAKER_01]: combine mycorrhizae with bacteria yeah you
actually can can you instead of growing
[SPEAKER_01]: them on whatever on clay can you grow them
on kelp yeah yeah you actually can man can
[SPEAKER_01]: you provide a food for them a molasses
yeah okay cool you know is all these extra
[SPEAKER_01]: things okay hey well amino acids if we add
an amino acid K complex in there will it
[SPEAKER_01]: affect anything or will give us any
beneficial results yeah it actually will
[SPEAKER_01]: we tested and it will all these things to
be able to make a product that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: add some value it actually separates you
from going and buying four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: different bottles it was kind of my homage
to making this industry a little bit more
[SPEAKER_01]: honest man a little bit more you know
following what growers do in commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: grow settings it did bother me man they
when you think they separate I know when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's humic and you're buying that for $40
a bottle and then fulvic you're buying for
[SPEAKER_01]: $40 a bottle and they don't bother telling
you that fulvic is just a lighter fraction
[SPEAKER_01]: of humic it's you know it's I don't like
when when people promote ignorance for for
[SPEAKER_01]: profit that's what I'm hoping we can
change in this industry and by the way it
[SPEAKER_02]: is changing it absolutely is yeah I've
seen it as well it definitely is changing
[SPEAKER_02]: for the better absolutely cool I want to
ask you about a couple other things when
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in cocoa so some folks they'll
monitor the pH PPM or EC are you
[SPEAKER_02]: monitoring those values and if so what do
you aim for when I use liquid nutrients I
[SPEAKER_01]: do right now I'm using these it's fairly
new for me I'm taking some of the lessons
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used over at the bamboo nursery which
is liquid feed for dessert and then your
[SPEAKER_01]: steak and potatoes just comes from a for
me it's a controlled release granular but
[SPEAKER_01]: when I'm doing liquid feed pretty easy
rule of thumb just in containers about a
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand PPM when I'm doing a bottom
feeding or a hempy bucket that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in that nutrient water so I'll go
down to seven to eight hundred PPM down
[SPEAKER_01]: there because they're constantly just
being bathed in it but yeah PPM pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easy I have one of those blue lab
truncheon meters it's easy enough to
[SPEAKER_01]: measure PPM if you're doing liquid feed I
will say pH a little bit more of a pain in
[SPEAKER_01]: the butt do you have a pH meter sir oh
yeah of course the blue lab with the I
[SPEAKER_01]: have one where it's which one you got I
got the apparel okay I'm gonna take a look
[SPEAKER_01]: at it I had for years and years I'd have
these blue lab meters I want and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like laboratory equipment I'm sitting
there in my grow and this is legit
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory equipment there's calibration
solution that you have to put in there
[SPEAKER_01]: there's storage solution there's all this
stuff that made it a pain in the butt and
[SPEAKER_01]: a guy like me was buying new probes every
six months $150 probe I'm buying because I
[SPEAKER_01]: the water ran out in mine or whatever you
know this the solution ran out so I have
[SPEAKER_01]: been able to get away from that thankfully
thankfully when I started learning about
[SPEAKER_01]: microbes and started using recharge I kind
of noticed that the plants were less
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to pH and I started using my pH
meter less and less and then I was just
[SPEAKER_01]: like everything's going fine there's a
problem I'll pull it out and what I
[SPEAKER_01]: learned was that microbes remember they're
aligning the roots and they're buffering
[SPEAKER_01]: the nutrient in the soil so they can
absorb or adsorb nutrients at a much wider
[SPEAKER_01]: range of pH's than just the roots the
roots those bare roots was it like a five
[SPEAKER_01]: five to six eight pH range and there's
there's nutrients specific nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: are absorbed as those pH's fluctuate a
little bit so it was really a joy for me
[SPEAKER_01]: to be able to throw out the pH pen and
I'll say that and granted you need to know
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're starting with everybody you
know I make it sound too easy throw out
[SPEAKER_01]: your pH pen and use microbes if you're
starting with water that's nine or you're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with water that's super acidic of
course you need to address that but for us
[SPEAKER_01]: in here in the over here in the Rockies
man it's some great water here so it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: in about neutral right about seven and
yeah I'm able to just actually the new
[SPEAKER_01]: millennium nutrients that I'm using and I
think you were talking about this painted
[SPEAKER_01]: lady there's something they get the
nutrient guys got it down to where when
[SPEAKER_01]: you mix it to a thousand ppm usually your
pH is is pretty stable or at least it's
[SPEAKER_01]: formulated for you know somewhere around
neutral so I don't use a pH pen anymore I
[SPEAKER_01]: let the microbes you know kind of be the
fudge factor buffer them for me and I've
[SPEAKER_01]: had good results and it has been that's
been a challenge for me as a look people
[SPEAKER_01]: in the face and say man you don't have to
use your pH pen anymore yeah both yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: both I don't know about that Scotty but
it's true yeah I've used blue planet
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients and then a mixture on that comes
out to be 5.8 pH and that's what I like
[SPEAKER_02]: for cocoa so that it was kind of hands-off
really didn't have to use a pH pen at all
[SPEAKER_02]: when growing in cocoa specifically because
my water came in at whatever it was but
[SPEAKER_02]: when I added the nutrients it would drop
it down to 5.8 pH is the perfect and I
[SPEAKER_02]: would just do 5.8 pH going in every time
and just completely ignore that the runoff
[SPEAKER_02]: pH and that worked great for me so yeah it
can definitely be simplified on that
[SPEAKER_01]: avenue for sure hey talk about that rock
the runoff pH people always talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting your runoff and testing the
parts per million and pH on it that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly with parts per million that
can be very deceiving you know it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: we talked about the shower washing the
salt right off you I mean if you're you
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had runoff before where the plants
are just because I hadn't water till
[SPEAKER_01]: runoff for a while where they're off the
chart you know it's over 2000 ppm but the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are still looking good and it's
just it really is a that's a receptive one
[SPEAKER_02]: I think yeah I mean we can get into real
deep on this right so it's not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: really the nutrients are gonna show up
unless they're in an ionic form right so
[SPEAKER_02]: right if people are putting in top
dressing nutrients for example those
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't in a ionic form just yet the
microbes have to break it down so some
[SPEAKER_02]: people will get a runoff number and
they'll realize it's way higher than what
[SPEAKER_02]: they put in well there's nutrients in
there they're breaking down in the
[SPEAKER_02]: meantime and then there's folks that are
out there they're like oh I have a 2000
[SPEAKER_02]: ppm or 2500 ppm but my plants look fine or
I need to flush well how big is your plant
[SPEAKER_02]: how big is that root system right I mean
because you're you're measuring the runoff
[SPEAKER_02]: but if you have a real small plant in
there with a small root system that hasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: reached everything well then you probably
are gonna be fine so yeah I totally get
[SPEAKER_02]: what you mean by it can be deceiving I
know the runoff ppm values are kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: just getting I get a guesstimate of what
could be in your medium in their general
[SPEAKER_02]: ranges that people can follow to kind of
help ensure that they're not overfeeding
[SPEAKER_02]: or underfeeding so you can break it down
to kind of like a beginner to simplify
[SPEAKER_02]: things but yes certainly can go outside of
those ranges and genetics are gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to take it some will be be able to
take higher than other you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean so there's there's a lot to do with
that but as far as pH you know checking
[SPEAKER_02]: the runoff of that again it gives you a
general idea of the pH and then sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: do a runoff test or you could do a slurry
test some people will take off some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: top layer of soil put it into a cup or
something add in some distilled water let
[SPEAKER_02]: it sit there for however long and then
take a test that way so there's two
[SPEAKER_02]: different ways to kind of to measure it
but it's really just to give you a general
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of what's in the medium you know what
I mean to make sure you're in those proper
[SPEAKER_02]: ranges because I think you and I both know
if your pH is off it inhibits some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients from being uptaken right if it's
too low it inhibits some nutrients too
[SPEAKER_02]: high it inhibits some nutrients so so yeah
that's why I was just kind of curious on
[SPEAKER_02]: your avenue if you did monitor the pH or
ppm EC in any value in any way I mean so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's interesting to hear how you go about
it yeah I've gotten quite lazy about the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH maybe I just have you know I've been
here for 12 years now as far as in this
[SPEAKER_01]: town I'm familiar with the water and yeah
I'm just able to dial it in I guess but I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't use a pH meter anymore and I will
say for I've been growing since 1991 I
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely wasn't growing to the point
where I had $300 to sink in a pH meter for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time I would use those little you
can get them it's like a little $5 pH test
[SPEAKER_01]: kit it's got the little bottle of droppers
and you drop a couple drops in there and
[SPEAKER_01]: it gives you essentially just a color
whether it's red for super acid almost
[SPEAKER_01]: blue for super basic believe it or not if
you're on a budget you can certainly test
[SPEAKER_01]: your pH and get it within you know a half
of a point a quarter of a point within you
[SPEAKER_01]: know with something really simple like
that I'm trying to make gardening really
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible to anyone you know under a
hundred bucks you should be able to put
[SPEAKER_01]: together a little system for your balcony
anyhow yeah I completely agree you can
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely get away with those those small
test kits I actually have the same thing
[SPEAKER_02]: for my pool my swimming pool I use that to
test the pH and make sure that's balanced
[SPEAKER_02]: the same same stuff is being done there
I'm from Florida I definitely managed my
[SPEAKER_01]: family's pool for since I was eight years
old it's fun it can be fun but anyways
[SPEAKER_02]: let's get back on topic of hempy buckets I
know you wanted to talk about those can
[SPEAKER_02]: you talk about can you like explain in
detail what hempy buckets are and how you
[SPEAKER_01]: grow in them it's just super simple
concept I learned about it I think there
[SPEAKER_01]: is a guy named hempy at least there was
and it's just a sip bucket I don't know if
[SPEAKER_01]: you ever go when you go to Walmart or Home
Depot most of the buckets they don't they
[SPEAKER_01]: have like a little they have like a little
lip on the bottom that you can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: water there and then the idea you water
from the bottom there's maybe a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: inch reservoir that holds that water and
then it slowly wicks up and it uses
[SPEAKER_01]: capillary action of the soil to wick up
and feed the roots and it always keeps
[SPEAKER_01]: those roots at an even once once you dial
it in keeps those roots at an even
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture it's the perfect moisture I'll
dig down into a hempy bucket I'll grab
[SPEAKER_01]: some soil that's in there some cocoa I'll
squeeze it just a little bit of water I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: come out it's just that perfect moisture
and like I said plants need air they need
[SPEAKER_01]: air for those roots to breathe for those
microbes to live they need water and they
[SPEAKER_01]: need nutrients so yeah giving them giving
them plenty of air is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a big deal definitely cool a
hempy bucket is just so we'll say this is
[SPEAKER_01]: the size of a container right here we'll
say this is a normal container you just go
[SPEAKER_01]: two inches up two inches up and you just
put a little hole in there you can use a
[SPEAKER_01]: drill if you don't have a drill you can
use a damn steak knife don't sue me but
[SPEAKER_01]: you just basically take and I take a five
gallon bucket and just one of those Home
[SPEAKER_01]: Depot buckets if you find a black one from
the the grow store it's better just
[SPEAKER_01]: because it you know it protects the roots
a little bit you don't want light getting
[SPEAKER_01]: to your roots but two inches up you just
drill a little hole in there maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: three-eighth inch hole the idea is you're
gonna fill right to the hole two inches
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna fill it with perlite just
that I like the chunky perlite but just
[SPEAKER_01]: perlite right to two inches and then you
just fill the rest with soil that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: simple hempy simple hempy bucket I use
cocoa modified cocoa and then the idea is
[SPEAKER_01]: you just water it until water comes out
that little hole basically what that means
[SPEAKER_01]: when you water to water comes out that
little hole you've filled up that little
[SPEAKER_01]: two inch layer of perlite on the bottom
you've given yourself a little two inch
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir you go you know you go back and
your soil is perfectly moist until that
[SPEAKER_01]: reservoir goes and then you just water it
again and maybe gives you an extra couple
[SPEAKER_01]: days or something but the most important
thing is it keeps that the soil evenly
[SPEAKER_01]: moist almost it doesn't take very long for
it to balance out and it's just such a
[SPEAKER_01]: simple way to grow just that five gallon
bucket it gives you a little you can go
[SPEAKER_01]: away for the weekend and it just affords
you hope it affords you a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: extra time between waterings and it keeps
that soil at a nice evenly moist level
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really important when you're
don't know and you're trying maybe over
[SPEAKER_01]: watering under watering it's pretty cool
that is pretty cool I remember reading
[SPEAKER_02]: about hempy buckets way back when I first
started in like 2010ish I think I seen
[SPEAKER_02]: people doing a hundred percent perlite in
theirs have you done a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_02]: perlite or you just do the the bottom bit
perlite and then above that cocoa I just
[SPEAKER_01]: do the cocoa I have been experimenting
honestly it's pretty cool we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: started this thing my newest project is
called 420 grow lab it's an open source
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge basically to the growers
community we've got a great community
[SPEAKER_01]: called the DGC that hangs out and shares
all their grow tips with us but just an
[SPEAKER_01]: open source project to come up with the
simplest system for growing good quality
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and it's the goal is to just I
put my basic hempy system up there and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's coming up with mods we did so
much of my emails busting open you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's overloading my email so we're making
this site but the idea is that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: spend whether it's you know you go buy one
of those monster garden kits or five or
[SPEAKER_01]: six hundred dollars for kind of everything
you need to get started but just to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to go or whether you go to your
hopefully go to your local grow store and
[SPEAKER_01]: support them and spend a few hundred bucks
get you know a two by four light and fan
[SPEAKER_01]: you spend what seven eight hundred bucks
and you're able to start growing I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's the idea behind it so I have
the simple hempy bucket system there's all
[SPEAKER_01]: sorts of mods there's folks that are
cutting 55 gallon drums out and instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: using perlite as a media they're using
she's one guy's using sand sent out to Ray
[SPEAKER_01]: with the hempy buckets man he's using sand
as a wick and then there's a difference in
[SPEAKER_01]: a heavy bucket between what you use in the
bottom and then what you use as far as the
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa media you know the the media up top
so the wick is really seems to be with
[SPEAKER_01]: cocoa where a lot of the innovation is
coming whether you're using perlite
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're using sand there's all
sorts of people trying to expanded clay
[SPEAKER_01]: balls but people are kind of playing with
that the best media up top though is cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as I'm concerned some kind of
amended cocoa that's cool sounds like it
[SPEAKER_02]: makes things a lot easier off to try out
heavy buckets sometime in the future I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that would be really fun you know do
something new plants haven't been growing
[SPEAKER_01]: in perlite for millions of years you know
billions of years they've been growing in
[SPEAKER_01]: soil right yep yeah so the symbiotic
relationships you know the relationship
[SPEAKER_01]: like I said if you think about what
perlite is we like it because it lets so
[SPEAKER_01]: much air in what we talk about bacteria
you know bacteria is it's it finds a way
[SPEAKER_01]: you know nature fills a vacuum like we
said so you're leaving those roots with a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of places to get pathogens from the
air so it's it's a bit more dangerous than
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're surrounding them a with the
mycorrhizae coating but still we put cocoa
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and then we put a bunch of
organic material to at least simulate soil
[SPEAKER_02]: with the castings yeah that makes sense
it's a good point it's a really good point
[SPEAKER_02]: all right Scotty so kind of wrapping
things up we've covered a lot of easy
[SPEAKER_02]: things to do when growing in cocoa in
particular a lot of good information here
[SPEAKER_02]: how can listeners find you and what do you
have upcoming in the future dude grows
[SPEAKER_01]: dude grows show if you like hearing me run
my mouth which I'm sorry I feel like I ran
[SPEAKER_01]: my mouth a little too much today but I
like I love your show I listen to it all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time I watch it and I was just really
excited to be here man thank you so much
[SPEAKER_01]: for that I really do appreciate the offer
sir dudegrows.com really is a way to find
[SPEAKER_01]: me real growers.com is where I sell
recharge but better to just type recharge
[SPEAKER_01]: you yell real growers recharge into your
phone if you want to learn anything about
[SPEAKER_01]: that and I will tell you I'm kind of
psyched me and my buddy banner over here
[SPEAKER_01]: are we are we have this goal of
simplifying growing I got banner growing I
[SPEAKER_01]: traded him for a website about five six
years ago got him started growing and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: so much fun to see the evolution of him
into a great grower it's like I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: spread that that's what the dude grows
show is about and that's what hopefully I
[SPEAKER_01]: do in this 420 grow lab 420 grow lab.com
but it like I said it's just an open
[SPEAKER_01]: source project to make the simplest
growing system we can we're gonna crowd
[SPEAKER_01]: source it we're gonna share these mods
like said I'm gonna put up a my basic
[SPEAKER_01]: system and let people mod it from there
I'm actually actively working on some mods
[SPEAKER_01]: right now so that's actually what got me
mostly excited right now awesome sounds
[SPEAKER_02]: good that's really exciting so I will

podcast it has really been an honor you're
[SPEAKER_02]: an inspirational person in this field so
thank you so much for coming on and
[SPEAKER_02]: spreading the knowledge about what you do
when keeping it simple growing a cocoa so
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you once again this is it is such a
joy to do this and to be able to connect
[SPEAKER_01]: with everybody you know connect with the
community keep some people company in the
[SPEAKER_01]: grow have an impact maybe have some folks
learn a couple things it is an absolute
[SPEAKER_02]: joy absolutely thank you so much peace you
