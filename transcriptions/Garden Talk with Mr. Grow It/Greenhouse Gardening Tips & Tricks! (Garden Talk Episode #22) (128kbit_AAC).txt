[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on garden talk pressure-treated
two-by-fours I space it out around five
[SPEAKER_00]: feet and goes the length of 34 feet and
then I have the opening on each end with a
[SPEAKER_00]: door Green lacewing larva and that's what
the listen flowers are for Because they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: eat that while they're staying around and
getting to the mites or getting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other pests The plant doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an advocate for that I really don't
think the plant cares about the science
[SPEAKER_00]: that we keep trying to implement on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a sales tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The California spotter mite will swim
through almost all your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be spraying diligently like
every three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 122 degrees in there and the plants
were just praying not worried about a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you that don't know me, my name is
Chris aka Mr. Grow It and you're tuned

[SPEAKER_01]: In this episode we talk about greenhouse
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cover everything from how he built his
greenhouse, pest prevention, supplemental
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, lake deprivation, and a little
bit about how he grows his plants in his
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: He has multiple.

[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so here we are with Frosty
McNasty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm great, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been watching you for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to be up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been watching you for a little while
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one thing I noticed is that you do a
lot of greenhouse growing and I haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: had anybody on the podcast yet that does
greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm super excited for this one to kind
of dig in and find out what you do.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but before we get into all of that,
can you tell us a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself and kind of how you got into
gardening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a friend of mine showed me that
plants are the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you need to learn some
agriculture, feed your family if the worst
[SPEAKER_00]: case scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just started out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberries, bell peppers, all kind of
easier things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Squash, everything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zucchini.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the greenhouse is great because you
can just control the cooler season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can heat it up and you can vent it out
when it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it's hot, it is kind of difficult to
keep it cool though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you decided to launch a YouTube channel
and now you're showcasing plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When did you launch the YouTube channel
and how many subscribers are you up to
[SPEAKER_01]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Embarrassingly, I'm only at 5,500
subscribers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been doing this for like 2016,
but it's starting to pick up more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are seeing the channel and they're
like, I've never seen this channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have been subscribed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe I'm doing something wrong in the
algorithm.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: YouTube algorithms is definitely tough to
work around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they'll blacklist you like that,
you know, no prob, no problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but now 5,500, that's a good amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people who would kill to have that
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's, that's a really good
amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and then you also have a podcast
channel now, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell us a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The green table podcast with my co-host
beast coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having some fun over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I initially found out about you
is through that podcast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had did an interview with THC Titan,
the breeder of square one genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that one, uh, I was super stoked to
hear you dropped some gems on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, yeah, you guys are doing your
thing over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super pumped that you guys have that
going something I tune in from time to
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, for the those audiences watching
or listening in, just search green table
[SPEAKER_01]: podcast on YouTube and you'll come across
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I appreciate the look,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just over there having some fun kicking
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely good times for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk all about greenhouse
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's probably most appropriate to
start with kind of, you know, I know you
[SPEAKER_01]: have multiple greenhouses, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you tell us like a little bit about
what size greenhouses they are and the
[SPEAKER_01]: construction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, uh, you know, there are several ways
to construct a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you build it?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all a learning, a learning thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first greenhouse was a 10 by 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still have that up and I'll just use the
space because that's what I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could go longer or wider,
I would have, but for some reason this 10
[SPEAKER_00]: foot is so easy to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put the great amount of plants in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything could be healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fans are going down the center row.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have about four beams going down the
center.
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC goes over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me just start about the
construction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the outside I'm using two by fours,
uh, pressure treated two by fours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spaced it out around five feet and goes
the length of 34 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have the opening on each end
with a door, um, just constructed door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just simple two by two
frame and something really simple just to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep it open or closed to, to vent out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I run a two by four across the
top for the frame and then put 20 foot of
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes from just, just started at
the two by four and wrap it all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: around the top, screw it in, put some
plastic on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What type of plot is there a special type
of plastic that you put over the top or,
[SPEAKER_00]: or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six mil plastic works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this woven plastic, but it wasn't UV
rated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sun just burnt it up before the
season could finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know in one of your
greenhouses, you have like a material on
[SPEAKER_01]: the bottom too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like a black material on the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shade cloth, shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually ground cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's woven also.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows for water to go through,
but not that fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it stops the pests from coming up and
eating your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's like a six foot roll by 300,
get it for like 80 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also have the shade cloth up
top too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes this, this, this summer has been
crucial in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you're in California,
but, um, it's crucial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot out there too, but it's been hot
and dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been needing to cover the plants
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just give them a break.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like your construction is
pretty cheap, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned, you know, pressure treated
wood that comes up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's beams along the middle,
uh, connected to two by fours,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of looping around plastic up top.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got the cloth on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much does something like that roughly
cost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that greenhouse costs me
about 800 bucks, around 800.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastic is the most expensive thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plastic is costing around 400 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: A roll, you know, um, from two 50 to 400,
depending on the size, the width and the
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, the other greenhouses,
those are four by fours along the edges
[SPEAKER_00]: because this needs more support because
it's wider.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could take it back, I would just do
10 foot greenhouses though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how are you attaching the plastic
to the actual beams and stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just like a staple gun or what are
you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll rip up fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use those one by twos like fern
strips, cut little pieces and then just
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of screw it into the plastic tight,
screw it into the wood where it just
[SPEAKER_00]: smashes against the, um, the, the other
each opposite sides of the wood and the
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic in between.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps it all tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that size greenhouse, how many plants
do you run?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I know it's going to vary
depending on what type of plants you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're growing lettuce,
kale, bok choy, some type of leafy green,
[SPEAKER_01]: give it a lot more plants in a greenhouse
that size versus a plant that particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: takes up like a two foot by two foot
space, a three foot by three foot space,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for you, um, for the plants you're
growing, how many plants do you roughly
[SPEAKER_01]: fit in those, those greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a good rule of thumb is about two feet
by two feet per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want some walkways to get in and
water, even if it's set up with
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still want to be able to get in and
pick leaves and hand water sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that 10 by 30, I have 60 plants and
a 20 by 30, I have two separate rows.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had 96 plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have two separate walkways.
[SPEAKER_01]: How wide are the walkways so you can get
in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: About a foot and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a foot and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So about 18 inches or so.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I bet you should get, you should be
able to get in there, do whatever you got
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, watering is a big thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what type of water do you use?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use in rain water, tap water,
well water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our water comes out around 140 ppm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fairly good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I never seen any, any issues with cow
mag or mineral deposits or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, so it's basically directly from
a hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, is there like a filter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes people attach a filter to it to
filter out some of the, I used to use
[SPEAKER_00]: filters and everything, but I seen that it
doesn't, the plant doesn't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an advocate for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really don't think the plant cares about
the science that we keep trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's overboard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a sales tactic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the plant should be in the growing
fine and it's, it will continue to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of things that we get into
and a lot of things you hear online,
[SPEAKER_01]: people on videos, try to overcomplicate
the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've had a lot of guests over the,
um, the six months that I've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this, they have just mentioned that they
like to keep it simple, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so doing things like that,
where you're not filtering out some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are in there, the plant will
still grow for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, are you doing hand watering or do you
have an auto watering system or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have both.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I like to feed with hand watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the food to get everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the 20 by 30 greenhouses,
I use beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So twice a week, I'll hand water the beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the rest of the time I have it on
the time dripper, just straight water,
[SPEAKER_00]: like once or twice a day, cause it's hot
during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So got to keep it hydrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit more about the
dripper system you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: You assume you have it hooked up to like a
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size reservoir would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Work the drip system I have is hooked up
to the main spigot for the house,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a house spigot outside garden hose
type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from the spigot, I use a 25 pressure
regulator, 25 PSI pressure regulator,
[SPEAKER_00]: a regular Walmart garden timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes to a water hose to the,
um, to a wide connector filter,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a one 50 micron mesh filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then from then it goes to the half
inch holes and that hose goes around in a
[SPEAKER_00]: loop in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then little quarter inch hoses go to
the plant connected to four gallon per
[SPEAKER_00]: hour drippers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then how long did you say you had the
time?
[SPEAKER_01]: How often does that timer come on?
[SPEAKER_00]: I turned it on five 30 in the morning for
20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know you have one greenhouse
with beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I've seen in some of your videos,
you have grow pots as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're in soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What size grow pots are those plants in?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is it 10 gallons?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the fabric pots and not the
fabric ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the plastic because I'm always
changing my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like beds, I think are the future for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't want to get smart pots
spending 10 bucks a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like 600 bucks for 60 plants where
I could spend like 50 cent and have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount for way cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get any of those issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people say that the plastic is
going to get too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots are going to burn.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've never seen any issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, again, it's a lot of sales,
a lot of sales tactics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for soil, what type are you using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a particular brand you're using?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you creating your own mix or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on how you want to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to live in soil, you want to
amend your own soil and do your own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to feed, it really doesn't
matter what soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you worrying about the soil for
if you're going to be feeding it anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's just a media to hold the
roots in and keep the stalk strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just use a regular happy frog for
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some mycorrhizae in there to help
start it off right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after it's starting off, I'm going to
be feeding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't really worry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the beds, I got compost in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got soil builder that has all the
feather mills and chicken manure,
[SPEAKER_00]: bat guanos, things like that in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as really amending my own soil,
I haven't done that yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like, Kirk, if I'm wrong,
it sounds like you're doing two different
[SPEAKER_01]: things where you have using synthetic
bottled nutrients on one greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you're kind of doing the living
soil organic in your beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what are you using for the bottled
nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: House and garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use their complete lineup and do
you follow their feeding chart or do you
[SPEAKER_01]: do a half dose or how do you do the
feedings?
[SPEAKER_00]: I noticed a thousand milliliters per 55
gallon drum for A and B the whole way
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no additives, no Cal Mag, no silicone
or nothing?
[SPEAKER_00]: No Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes Epsom salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, it's just A and B.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know in your living soil side of
things, what are you using for nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know you're also doing a cover
crop as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen a video where it was just
sprouting up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us about what you'd use
for nutrients and then kind of your cover
[SPEAKER_01]: crop and such?
[SPEAKER_00]: The living soil thing kind of got screwed
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started it off like that, but I ran into
a nitrogen deficiency, like a really bad
[SPEAKER_00]: one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just wasn't getting any nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went to house and garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to give it what it needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they just perked up, greened up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to practice this next year on
the living soil side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to go ahead and cover crop
still, keep that healthy and cut it down
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of just work the soil a little
bit for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for now, I'm just going to go ahead
and keep the house and garden thing going
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can't waste time and I don't
want to waste a crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got to do what you got to do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cover crop, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just looks great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just looks like you're out in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a whole other world down
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: What were you using for cover crop,
did you say?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mix on Amazon, just like a five
pound bag of cover crop, like 20 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got a few of those and sprinkled
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It got some clover in there, a couple
types of clover and the other stuff I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you sprinkle that on at a certain
point?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you sprinkle it on like when a plant
first sprouts, do you wait or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're actually supposed to do it a long
time before, but I didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of sprinkled it on after I planted
and watered everything in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then about a week or so they start
growing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also got some alyssum flowers,
yarrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do I have in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two types of yarrow, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm using that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I want to start giving some
beneficial bugs and that'll help feed the
[SPEAKER_00]: bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm trying to, I'm not a professional
at the living soil thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just trying to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continuous improvement, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to keep on learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing I love about gardening is
there's just so many different ways to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it and the continuous learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like you're doing the
same thing over and over and over again,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're pushing yourself to learn more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always something new.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm starting to learn is like
when you look at gardening, you look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's wildfires.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's monsoons.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got everything on this planet,
but the plants still live.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep on trying new things and
figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hop over into environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with greenhouse growing, you know,
it's completely different from growing
[SPEAKER_01]: indoors, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you have an indoor operation as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, indoors, temperature,
humidity can easily get out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's pieces of equipment where you
can put in there to regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greenhouses are going to be a little
different there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go one by one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and one of your recent videos,
I saw that you don't even have a
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature gauge on there because you
feel like you can't control it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me ask you how high have
temperatures gotten?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you, you don't have any type of cooling
in there at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the 20 by 30s, it's really like hotter
over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because it's not far away
from the 10 by 30, but it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: for some reason, it gets hot in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was up to like 107 one day and the
plants were happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't care about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the plants had water at the
roots, they were fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They could take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a friend's house and you could
walk up close to his greenhouse and you
[SPEAKER_00]: could just feel the heat coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, why don't he lift the
sides up?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get closer and I'm like,
I'm kind of going in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 122 degrees in there and the plants
were just praying, not worried about a
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant could take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you lift up your sides,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't even for the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was more like for me just to make sure
that they were getting wind flow and
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, but they never looked
bad, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of times we do things for
us instead of the plant because the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: could take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just to kind of go back, you have that
plastic that wraps up and kind of up and
[SPEAKER_01]: around and over.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just basically lifting it up on
both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sides, when you have the four by
four to two box force for your support,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're screwing that, that, um,
fern strip up at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gives you the bottoms to roll up and
just use a regular clamp to keep it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some simple, you know, this is simple
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have way better automated systems and
cost twenties and thirties of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just for this, it's really simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just lift it up, roll it up, keep it
tight, put a clamp on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your sides open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sounds easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And lifting it up, it's good to have that
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can aerate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine some people building a
greenhouse and not building that
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're kind of screwed in a sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I didn't at first, I kept the sides
down and I figured that the openings on
[SPEAKER_00]: each end will create a wind tunnel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's not windy, you got to open
those sides up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in the winter time, uh, you know,
temperatures can get pretty cold there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do anything in regards to,
do you have any like heating system or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, or do you just let shut it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you shut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't even grow in the greenhouse at
all in the winter time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What months typically is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right when it's over like September,
October, let's go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the, with these beds, if I decide
to keep the same structures, which I might
[SPEAKER_00]: not, because I noticed that I'm losing,
um, a lot of square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: By having three separate structures
instead of one large one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of square footage that I could
fill in a lot of blank space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I might just scratch the whole thing
and start over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: So utilizing space is a big thing for you,
huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably one of your main goals to do
is utilize space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at first I like things to be nice
and, um, you know, I like nice lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like things to work right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like one, one, um, plant variety in each
group.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greenhouse so I could have everything
cohesive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I made three, but now I'm
looking at, I got hours down the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, inside the greenhouse and
around the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's cancel out the betweens and
insides and use all that space for canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: and just make one big structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what about humidity kind of sticking
on the environment thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Humidity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, are you doing can't really do too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whatever the humidity is outside,
it's going to be inside and, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity comes with rain, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not doing anything in the rain and
season, so I never worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down to like 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really weird coming from indoor to
greenhouse because all the, all the people
[SPEAKER_00]: say 75, 50, that's like a norm,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now with led lights, they're saying
82, 84, 65, 70% humidity, VPD and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the best flower in the
greenhouse with total different numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about 84 in a day,
55 at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colors explode now through the buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of color, a lot of color.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when humidity gets high, one of the
concerns, and this can happen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, I don't know if you've
encountered it before, it's powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you encountered powdery mildew at all
or?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because it's not high in the
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is, it gets high for,
I cover the greenhouse at 5 PM and I
[SPEAKER_00]: uncover at 10 o'clock to induce flying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering on certain varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that time it's humid and it's hot,
but it's such a short time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see any issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you also have plenty of air
circulation anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen your videos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk a little bit about air
circulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many fans you have for that
greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four in one and three in the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's enough airflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go in, you can feel air movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all that's really needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep it up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, keep that, keep that air
circulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sides and the other opposite
ends, they keep a nice, nice little vortex
[SPEAKER_00]: of wind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so key for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now what about CO2?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything for CO2 or just outside CO2?
Outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do anything because it's not a
sealed space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never sealed.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that greenhouse was sealed,
you're talking about 160 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you have cooling and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's a total different
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about way more construction,
way more power.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a total different construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cost will go through the roof,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: With all that electricity consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use a swamp cooler on one end.
[SPEAKER_00]: In closed, like you put boards up,
create a wall, put a swamp cooler there
[SPEAKER_00]: and have a small fan on the opposite end.
[SPEAKER_00]: That just makes the cool air flow through
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought about that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I thought about a lot,
but it's working simpler without buying
[SPEAKER_00]: the expensive equipment and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's switch it up and let's talk about
lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the benefits of growing outdoors
in a greenhouse is you get free lighting
[SPEAKER_01]: with the sun, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to spend any money on
electricity consumption there,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you're using supplemental
lighting as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about what
you use and when you use it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you want to extend the daytime
a few hours, maybe four hours in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning to keep things in a vegetative
state, I just use these LED strip lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They work pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just use those, keep it on a timer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only for like a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: After that, just using the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sun is the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a PAR meter, you know what I
mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go outside, it's 1,700 PAR.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's unrivaled.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't mess with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't replicate it either,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we're talking about the
supplemental lighting, just a very small
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of light is needed, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to need to power,
you know, 400, 600 watts per five by five
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just need a small amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how many watts each of those
LED are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Any idea how much?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, those are only like 18 watts a piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're bright enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants will still droop like
they're asleep, but they're still
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting that light and keeping it in
that vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you said you have a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any idea how much PAR that is
just with the supplemental lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I never checked that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would probably be around, I would think
around 200, maybe 400 PPFD at the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not even that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably like a T5, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a T5, just like 200.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not light is not a lot of light is needed
for supplemental lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people with Kavita's inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Overkill, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it adds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how about light deprivation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What you do for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I mean by using the
supplemental light for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you first planting, you want the
roots to expand through the pot until
[SPEAKER_00]: before you flower, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So sun comes up at six o'clock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just for hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun is up at six.
[SPEAKER_00]: Goes down around, say it was going down
around seven, but you want to go veg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need five more hours of
supplemental light till 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's your vegetative state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when you want to stop that,
you cut off your supplemental lighting and
[SPEAKER_00]: you tarp it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tarp at five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tarp at five PM.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I pull a black sheet over, that's light
proof, light leak proof.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put that down over all the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put like some cinder blocks on it to keep
it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll keep that on till 10 at night
when it's as dark as it's going to get for
[SPEAKER_00]: the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uncover it and let the sun wake the plants
up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm really at 13 hours of darkness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now this black sheet, do you know what
type of material is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it actually a black tarp or?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's just a six mil black and white
poly like the Panda film.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got way better ones because these rip
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next year I will not be using them
because the six mil is just the cheapest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really probably made for just
people that's doing it for a season,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to get more technical,
this 14 mil woven that will not rip at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're talking about 1400 bucks a roll,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's worth it when you think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to be doing it,
it's worth getting the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the right clear plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever had any problems with kind
of doing that transition to where plants
[SPEAKER_01]: turned into hermaphrodites or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if you messed up the light schedule at
all, I'm just kind of wondering,
[SPEAKER_01]: curious on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like that would be something easy
to mess up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when you look at a PAR meter,
you will see that you can see and the PAR
[SPEAKER_00]: read like five.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five compared to 1700, it's not going to
affect it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see, I think the higher the light
intensity is during this daylight,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more leeway you have for its night
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it has a little more leeway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like I said, I'm not a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just knowing what I see and I know I
have rips in the plastic sometimes like
[SPEAKER_00]: little spots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nothing ever happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas indoor, that might be an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know a common question I get all the
time is like, oh, the moon has light and
[SPEAKER_01]: why don't plants continue to grow on the
moonlight and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, it's not enough
photons of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to drive photosynthesis at
all, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we could see, but the plant doesn't
absorb that light, that starlight or
[SPEAKER_00]: moonlight or nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even like my neighbor has a bright light
in his yard and I was scared of it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like so bright, but it didn't,
it didn't register on a PAR meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't registering anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's flip it up and let's talk about
plant support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know you do a couple different things
to support.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once the plants grow up big to a
certain point, they might have flowers on
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so heavy that are going to kind of
flop all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk to us a little bit about
what you do for plant support?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the beginning, in the beginning,
I just use a bamboo stake to hold them up
[SPEAKER_00]: and get the roots strong enough to hold
their self.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I need it, you know, not all plants
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then after that, just trellis,
trellis works and trellis is needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you got a lot of plants, you need
trellis because that'd be a lot of bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'll need to clip.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use these orchid clips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any here, but I use these
little orchid clips and just clip a stalk
[SPEAKER_00]: to the bamboo, not the bottom stalk,
but like the top, just clip it to the
[SPEAKER_00]: bamboo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that works great.
[SPEAKER_01]: At what point are you adding in the stakes
in the trellis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always too late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always waiting to like week two of
flower to add trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I should start off with trellis right
over the canopy and then go into flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it gets that support on all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I always start late.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I was wrong with me,
but I got to fix that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any type of like plant
training, whether it be topping,
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliation, leaf tucking, lollipop,
anything like that or?
[SPEAKER_00]: Always lollipop.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always clean up the bottoms and I always
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just keep it simple and top.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been doing that for like six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just, just top, get about eight tops on
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, that's enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people argue and say, edge two weeks
longer, top more and top more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like two weeks is a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, we're on schedule, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So no, I'm gonna do it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gotta love backseat growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always sit behind the computer telling you
how to grow your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day, all day in the comments,
do this, do this, do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I checked their page and I'm like,
what are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: No two girls are alike.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, everybody does it their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like outside, I don't see the need for a
full trellis canopy because the
[SPEAKER_00]: penetration of the sun is going to get
down to the lowers and it's all going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be usable material in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: IPM and pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably should have talked about this
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I always talk about this last
at the podcast, but really, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is one of the, one of the more
important things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when you're growing outdoors is
these pests, they can completely ruin your
[SPEAKER_01]: crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're not, if you don't have things
under control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those things that,
um, I lack on sometimes, um, trying to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more preventative, but it seems like a lot
of products just don't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a lot of stuff just, especially with
spider mites, I don't know what's,
[SPEAKER_00]: the California spider might will swim
through almost all your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be spraying diligently like
every three days or even with the
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficials.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't see any, anything, um,
really work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, no tomorrow, tomorrow I'll be
getting some green lace wings in green
[SPEAKER_00]: lace wing larva.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the list some flowers are
for because they'll eat that while they're
[SPEAKER_00]: staying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And get into the, get into the mites or
get into the other pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this works because I'm
ordering 5,000 and I've got it on a
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule to come every week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every week, 5,000, 5,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully this works because I tried to
Neil Silas, California cause predator
[SPEAKER_00]: might, I didn't see anything work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's spider mites in particular that
you're battling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any other pests that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get out of the box?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it leaves a nice little coat on your
leaves, a little shine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty good.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some of the pests you've,
you've encountered in kind of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: battle them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do anything in like the vegetative
stage as like an, as a preventative at
[SPEAKER_01]: all, or are you doing like a neem oil or
are you doing anything, uh, any type of- I
[SPEAKER_00]: did, I did neem oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to, I try to mix everything up
because I always have plants around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how plant, you know how pests
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They, they, they, they, they leave like,
um, kind of, what's the word I'm looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they get immune to it over a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: It builds up like a tolerance to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of mixing it up all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't say anything works more than
just continuing, continuing spraying and
[SPEAKER_00]: just making sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is just keep everything clean,
whatever you use, just keep using it,
[SPEAKER_00]: switch it up and just do it at least once
a week, at least once a week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you think things are just perfect
spray, just do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people say they don't spray,
they don't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like here's it's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just don't spray bad things, you know,
don't spray the bad stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there have been times where I've
been lazy on my outdoor garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: my little vegetable garden I have,
I have a two foot by 10 foot bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, you know, when you miss the
sprays and stuff, I think I missed the
[SPEAKER_01]: spray like three or four weeks in a row.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, and then we get all the way up
to harvest time and I'm going into harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: and just loaded with aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just like, yeah, the aphids suck
because they look disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look disgusting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, ah, no, you don't even want to
touch it or be around it, but you had to
[SPEAKER_00]: spin a sad, spin a sad works for the user
spin a sad just once a week, just use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to have to try that out for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't used spin a sad yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a, that's like a secret
ingredient in a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mostly grow indoors and you don't
really need much indoors, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: as long as your environment is pretty
clean and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you take the precautions of not going
directly from outdoors directly into your
[SPEAKER_01]: grow tent and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can kind of get away with these IPM
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't, I'm everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just got to stay up on my,
my sprays and a lot of, a lot of times
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll pick up problems from your garden
supply also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to be careful with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people, a lot of people go into
that garden supply, drop in their issues
[SPEAKER_00]: off right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So be careful Amazon, you know,
just order it come to your door and just
[SPEAKER_00]: just do it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went over quite a bit today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of final questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a lot of people who are just
getting started with greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I imagine that there are people
clicking on this, this podcast episode and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: What advice would you have for somebody
who's kind of just starting out greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: growing for a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a lot of DMS all the time about
questions about the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't overthink it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just build a structure and think about
what could go wrong while you building it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For say like you're using PVC without a
center beam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might collapse on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC is hard, but it might collapse.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use one inch PVC, you know,
can make it thicker cemented in cement
[SPEAKER_00]: your board.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in your support boards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you can get away with doing the
cheapest greenhouse ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it'll work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to be, if you want to be
in it for the long run, just go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: spend the right amount of money for the
right items and just, and just do some
[SPEAKER_00]: research and look at the new, look at the
new greenhouses that are built with steel
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I would say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to replicate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perlins, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just go all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you can't buy a cheap greenhouse
from Amazon and that's the best start.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your best start right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Steel structure, vented, roll up door,
you know, that's your best.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your best bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good advice for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where can the listeners find you and
what do you have upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Frosty McNasty on Instagram on YouTube.

Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the future, I'm just, I have a
strain called short year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a, it's very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on 2022 that strain being a lot of
places, a lot of places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just, just keep on being an asset
to the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not trying to take from it, just trying to
help.
