[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, what's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome back to my channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that don't know me,
my name is Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're tuned into my Q&A series.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this is your first time watching one of
my Q&A videos, I film them every single
[SPEAKER_00]: month live on Twitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Follow me at twitch.tv slash Mr. Grow It.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can be notified when I go live next.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can ask me questions and potentially
get featured in a future episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let's get into some questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to ask you out of all the different
watering methods you've done, blue mats,
[SPEAKER_00]: auto pots, bottom watering, etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your personal favorite way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to be trying a fully organic
grow next time, and I'm looking for the
[SPEAKER_00]: best way to be as hands off as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of all those methods, particularly with
organics, I liked the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still run the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using the individual carrots for all
the containers up until seven gallons,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was using two carrots, one on each
side of the container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm in 10 gallons and I'm actually
about to install distribution drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something you might want to look at if
you haven't already.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not just using carrots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what size container you're
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going with a larger
container, you might want to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution drippers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can just do what I did,
which was just have two different carrots,
[SPEAKER_00]: one on kind of each side of the stock,
each side of the container, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as they dry out, they just drop
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been really easy when it
comes to organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried the auto pots in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: Works great with synthetics, plant
available nutrients with organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, maybe it's just the client I'm
living in, but having that top layer moist
[SPEAKER_00]: at all times where the amendments are is
difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was seeing yellowing of the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just had much better results using
the blue mats because really it's a top
[SPEAKER_00]: down drip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been really liking the nutrient
well technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very controversial technique there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what that is, is you kind of
dig a little hole in there to put the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendments in that one hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the regular blue mat dripper
drips down onto that one spot where you
[SPEAKER_00]: have the nutrient well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been working out fantastic
for me for the past two to three runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm continuing to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you are disturbing the root zone a
little bit as you're digging down into the
[SPEAKER_00]: medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, being able to keep that part
of the medium moist, those amendments
[SPEAKER_00]: moist for proper breakdown so they can
then after they're broken down,
[SPEAKER_00]: be uptaken by the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been beneficial to run that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally like the blue mats over
any of the other methods that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: What new smart technology interests you
these days?
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to give a shout out to Mars Hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually sponsoring this Q&A
episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think their smart grow system is pretty
interesting these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, you get their iHub Smart Power
Strip, download their app, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: register on the app.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can hook up their grow lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, their FC series, FCE series is
compatible with other grow lights of
[SPEAKER_00]: theirs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can set the sunrise, sunset,
control the intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also hook up the inline fan to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have specific environment
conditions that kind of trigger that fan
[SPEAKER_00]: to come on and off humidifier,
dehumidifier fan, and even your heat mat
[SPEAKER_00]: can be plugged into it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also it's not only Bluetooth,
but Wi Fi connectivity it has.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely more to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to list everything here in
this Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want to learn more for more
information, go to their website,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mars-hydro.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Link will be in the YouTube description
section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can use discount code MRGROWIT
actually works for any of Mars-Hydro's
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feed with blue mats?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of just talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other question, basically,
if you're using the organic amendments,
[SPEAKER_00]: typically what people do is they'll do
that initial mending in the soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, with whatever fertilizer blend
you're using, for example, or if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: using individual amendments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then from there, you've installed the blue
mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing any additional top
dressing, like I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing the nutrient well technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people do spread it across the entire
medium, just top dress that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're using synthetics,
you would just have your bottled nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed into your reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reservoir actually has to be higher
than where your plants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll come down gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I was using synthetics,
just really changing out the media,
[SPEAKER_00]: changing out the reservoir each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of going by the feeding chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know depending on what plant you're
growing, typically looking at the feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: chart, half dose is what I typically do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes even a quarter dose,
especially with the blue mats,
[SPEAKER_00]: might want to start with a quarter dose to
begin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants could be precisely perfectly
healthy with just that quarter dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I just had Cal Mag in the
reservoir and that had worked out pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing the kind of Synganic grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had Fox Farm Ocean Force Soil,
which has nutrients in it, started out
[SPEAKER_00]: with that and then had Cal Mag in the
reservoir and was just dripping down that
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, I went to a more like
a bloom fertilizer when I was in
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just for veg only, I was able to get
away with just the Fox Farm Soil and then
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cal Mag along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you prefer bowl trimming or shear
trimming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people are going more
towards the bowl trimmer these days and I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have one yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I probably will get one in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard some good things about the bowl
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard some bad things about the bowl
trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of misinformation
when it comes to the bowl trimmer because
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people that I've talked to that
has had good success with it, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole trichomes falling off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure that there are, but I'm sure
that's not completely ruining the crop by
[SPEAKER_00]: using the bowl trimmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's some downsides of using a
bowl trimmer is that I guess apparently
[SPEAKER_00]: that fluffier type, larvier type or more
arier type of buds don't do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to be the density kind of has
to be there in order for that bowl trimmer
[SPEAKER_00]: to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just been hand trimming all these
years, but I definitely want to try out
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the bowl turners in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does your outdoor garden do in your
desert summers?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm subtropical with really hot temps in
the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time I'm actually not
growing outdoors in the summer,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wintertime, it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow kale, lettuce, bok choy,
spinach.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's mostly what I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a small two foot by 10 foot
raised bed in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a living soil fabric pot
raised bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been working out great over the
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here in the summertime, if you try to
grow those things, they're going to bolt
[SPEAKER_00]: like the lettuce and the spinach and so on
and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can really only take temperatures of
high 70s and then they'll start to bolt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally don't grow those things in
the summertime, but I will grow in the
[SPEAKER_00]: summer peppers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also get away with melons as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've grown a Madu Ross sweet melon does
really, really well in the desert region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are growing outdoors and it's
really hot where you live, definitely do
[SPEAKER_00]: some research and figure out what plants
are good for that climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the last thing you want to do is
plant some things where it's they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: handle the temperature and then they just
bolt and then you can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: With them anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on adding CO2 with
mushroom bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried it and I have seen an increase
using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's crazy what you read in the
comments section these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've made content on these
mushroom bags and there are people like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is a scam.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if they're using a CO2 meter
or not to kind of make those measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CO2 meter that I have a micro tent did
show an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I didn't do any specific studies on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To tell you for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, hey, at this time, it worked better
than this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had the mushroom bags in there and
then looked at my CO2 monitor randomly and
[SPEAKER_00]: then have seen an increase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've been able to get it up to
it was eight hundred to twelve hundred ppm
[SPEAKER_00]: is roughly what it ranged for with those
mushroom bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they worked out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with like the team Bay
Naturals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, very similar in the sense,
at least as far as me looking in my grow
[SPEAKER_00]: tent and seeing what the levels are and
seeing that the CO2 levels were elevated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they worked for me as far as how long
they work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really tell you and how well they
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, it's going to depend also on how
much you're exhausting the air,
[SPEAKER_00]: how to grow space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know once your grow light turns
on, you might have an exhaust some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hot air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, comes a CO2 with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's another reason why a lot of
people say it's just not worth it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people's opinion on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point in flower should I max on my
grow light wattage?
[SPEAKER_00]: What grow light are you using?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using HPS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using LED?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some LED grow lights, you don't need even
need to max them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, especially it depends on your
what your CO2 is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're running increased CO2,
often you're going to add in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: higher light intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these grow light these days,
people aren't actually running them at 100
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you demand to run in 100 percent,
let's say perfect world, 100 percent is
[SPEAKER_00]: good at the manufacturer recommended light
distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point of flowering, I would do that
probably within the first three weeks,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, is what I would try to max out the
light at in the first three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally speaking, 600 to 900 PPFD in the
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are looking to get a little bit
higher than that, if you're adding CO2
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to get a little bit higher,
some people go upwards of 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Commercial facilities go even higher than
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, you've also got to look at your
EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Might be a little bit more difficult to do
this running organics versus being in more
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment where
hydroponically, for example, we have that
[SPEAKER_00]: EC and you're able to change that very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, roughly the first three weeks is
when I'd be looking to max out that grow
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you tell the difference between
autos and photos?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the only real way to tell the
difference is if they start to
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically flower or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a elementary answer,
but you can't really plant an auto,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a photo, have them grow up to three
weeks and be able to tell the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: just by looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way to really tell the
difference is if one starts to
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically flower or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's usually around day 30 from
sprout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say 22 inches is safe distance
between light and top of the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depends on the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not all lights are created equal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some that'll be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others that will not be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, one of the, uh, geez,
what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was their old model light with the
blur pull?
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing had to be like 24 to 36 inches
away because 22 would have been too close.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most LED grill heads these days,
22 inches should be fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even in flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some go as low as 12 inches away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really depends on what grow light you
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some growers only use an inline fan
when drying in their tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still use an oscillating fan in your
dry tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would always use an oscillating fan in
the grow tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be on the bottom of the grow tent
and it would blow the air around so that
[SPEAKER_00]: air would be circulating at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people do run the inline fans
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe in air exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: I typically do once every 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exchanging the air and oftentimes I'm
just opening up the grow tent and then
[SPEAKER_00]: waving the grow tent flap.
[SPEAKER_00]: So air is being moved around, being
exhausted out of there that way real
[SPEAKER_00]: quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I always have to add in a
humidifier to increase the humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some people run a dehumidifier,
but these days I haven't really been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: drying that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that I have the Canada Troll,
so you guys can see that in the background
[SPEAKER_00]: right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada Troll, big shout out to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their machine is awesome in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Makes the drying process hands-off really.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just harvest a plant, cut the individual
branches so they'll fit into the Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Boom, boom, boom, on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after the first day you wet the
sponge and put it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps regulate the humidity and the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the drip pan on the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to make sure that gets emptied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only had to empty it I think twice when
I was drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that has been working out fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll definitely put a link in the YouTube
description section below if you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: learn more about the Canada Troll.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a new technology and a lot of people
have been asking about the review video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should have that out in the upcoming
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: If all goes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they have been sold out for quite
some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're still taking orders just on back
order.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a better way to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's hot product and I hope to
have that review video soon for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would always use the
oscillating fan on the dry tap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just an inline fan, but there are
different ways to go about it of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: This Fox Farm Ocean Forest Mix too hot for
autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been hot for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that's all you see in videos these
days for random people that just say it's
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never been hot for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 13 years I've been running Fox Farm
Ocean Forest soil for autos and for
[SPEAKER_00]: photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had like one plant, two plants that
actually like had issues with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it looked like it was just kind of
toxic with nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there I feel like it's just it's the
cultivar in that case doing it not so much
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always had good luck with Fox Farm
Ocean Forest soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really like that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have it in my local nursery down the
street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I tend to go after that if I need
bagged soil like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say no, it's not too hot for
autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to know in the comments
section below if anybody out there has had
[SPEAKER_00]: too hot of soil for autos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly the Fox Farm Ocean Forest
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know down in the comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting to see if anybody
speaks up on that one.
