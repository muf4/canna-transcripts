[SPEAKER_00]: What is up everybody, if you that don't
know me, my name is Chris aka MrGrowIt and
[SPEAKER_00]: today I've got a power test video for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the California Lightworks
SolarStum 1100 LED grow light.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a coverage area of 4 foot by 4 foot
and the tent I am taking measurements in
[SPEAKER_00]: is 4 foot by 4 foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This LED grow light is compatible with a
controller.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not have the controller so the
measurements I take will just be from
[SPEAKER_00]: plugging in the light without adjusting
the spectrum at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually ran this grow light for a
couple grows and those grows are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: documented on my YouTube channel so I've
had a couple grow series using this light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to see how those plants
turned out, feel free to look back at
[SPEAKER_00]: those videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take measurements at 18 inches,
24 inches, and then 36 inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm using the Apogee MQ-500 quantum
sensor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This takes part measurements in PPFD and
I'm just gonna be doing the measurements
[SPEAKER_00]: in the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna be talking about it in the
features or anything like that so if you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to learn more about this LED grow
light, I will link it in the description
[SPEAKER_00]: section below.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, let's get into the measurements.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the other videos, I won't talk
over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just let the measurements do the
talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching.
I'll see you next time.
