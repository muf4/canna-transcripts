[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk Podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I am joined with Cartier Krops.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you doing today?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, and I'm actually lying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not doing well, but we're going to
make this happen today, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to make it happen
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little under the weather, some chest
pain and whatnot, but let's make it
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you on that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I woke up with a migraine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been battling that all day,
and then some nausea, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: ah, I'm going to battle through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, you'll be doing most of the
talking this time around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to keep my breath so that way we
can make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we going to get into today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you are not only a grow,
you're not only a gardener, but you're
[SPEAKER_00]: also a breeder as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I really want to dive deep
into today is really all about plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually had a handful of breeders on
this podcast in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing I've noticed is that there
are so many different ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many different things you can
do within breeding, whether it be
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding, back crossing, self-crossing,
create feminized seeds, so on and so
[SPEAKER_00]: forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not only that, but the characteristics
that people are looking for within plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: males and females, vary, you know,
really comes down to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really eager to jump into this
conversation and find out kind of what you
[SPEAKER_00]: look for in your plants and how you do
your breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, what we do in every single one
of these episodes is an introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you tell us a little bit about
yourself and kind of how you got into
[SPEAKER_00]: gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, man, it was 1996 and my family and I
moved to Indiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was 16 years old and my mother had had a
boyfriend at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they, you know, they they did their
extracurricular activities every single
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while I was watching them,
I was like, hey, man, these dudes,
[SPEAKER_01]: these dudes, they they puff a lot,
you know, and I was like in my head,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, come from humble beginnings,
you know, my mind has always been on how
[SPEAKER_01]: can I add one plus one equal to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the gentleman did blaze a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I was like, hey,
maybe I can grow some of these seeds that
[SPEAKER_01]: he's leaving down in the basement and
maybe I can provide them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when you go from humble
beginnings, your mind processes is how can
[SPEAKER_01]: I get by?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I survive?
[SPEAKER_01]: How will I make it?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that was my that was the
introduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that summer, I'll never forget that
summer because I was able to take the
[SPEAKER_01]: seed, go outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live right behind a cornfield and large
cornfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I had this great idea of
taking these beans and going on the
[SPEAKER_01]: cornfield and planting them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Didn't know anything about anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, the bowl I used was a
bleach bowl.
[SPEAKER_01]: No cap, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used I cut a bleach bowl in half,
rinsed it out, bro, put some soil in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, threw my things in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sprouted and it was like the most
amazing thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after they got so big, I just took it
out and put it in the cornfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the interesting thing was that each
day, you know, I would go out there and
[SPEAKER_01]: water and I would go out there and kind of
entertain my thought of raising these
[SPEAKER_01]: things to make these millions of dollars
off this one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I continue to water, I started to
realize something really cool is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of the things is,
you know, when you take care of something
[SPEAKER_01]: other than yourself, you build some type
of relationship no matter what it is or
[SPEAKER_01]: what it could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point in time, you know,
watering, watering my plants and being
[SPEAKER_01]: there every single day, talking to my
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought I was going crazy, but being
able to talk to my plants, be a part of my
[SPEAKER_01]: plant started to grow on me and things
started to evolve within myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to learn a lot about myself that
summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting because then I
got bit by that bug that summer and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: something really unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was really unique was,
you know, it started to take different
[SPEAKER_01]: forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started small.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point in time, you know,
I didn't have a father figure around.
[SPEAKER_01]: There weren't too many role models around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm new in a place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this plant was really the only
thing that was in front of me that would
[SPEAKER_01]: watch my tears, that would, you know,
would like I said, I would talk to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really a touching moment
throughout that summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the time I had to chop it
down because it didn't look too pretty.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the time it came that it was time to
chop down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it really touched me in
some type of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I understood is that,
hey, man, everything has a beginning,
[SPEAKER_01]: middle and end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and as long as we continue
to provide ourselves with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best, whether it be nutrients or or the
best positive vibes, period, we can see
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves flourish like this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ever since that day, every single day of
my life, I've had a plant around no matter
[SPEAKER_01]: what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, the the the plant has
always been a special thing to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of always been a place for
me to go hang out and really spend my time
[SPEAKER_01]: and reflect on life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I said, there's nothing better
than taking care of something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you get there's a benefit
that comes along, you know, with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I remember when we my mom ended up
breaking up with her boyfriend,
[SPEAKER_01]: we moved into an apartment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember we had an upstairs
apartment and my brother-in-law moved in
[SPEAKER_01]: with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, he saw that I was growing
my little things in the closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a little two by two closet.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, hey, man, I work at this place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, this guy has a light.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's from Europe and he has this light.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first time I was introduced to
HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, I was like, all right,
man, tell them to bring a light because I
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to, you know, lead to the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know anything at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he brings me this this big bulb,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's HPS lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: First time I found out what a HPS light
was in 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he brings this huge bulb to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, man, what you got still
there from that came off a light pole or
[SPEAKER_01]: something, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's like, no, man, it's a it's a HPS
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an HP powered situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got I didn't know what it would admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plug the dang light in, man,
and it lights up the whole my mom's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what the heck is going on back there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I have so many stories of of
when it all started in the journey and
[SPEAKER_01]: how, you know, I got involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, realistically, planning
that first seed in that field really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really did something special.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the journey has been really
cool thus far.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really helped me out,
you know, as a human being along the way,
[SPEAKER_01]: man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so 1997.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been here all day long and talk for
hours on stories that I have from the
[SPEAKER_01]: journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, that's 1996, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: 1997 is when I started consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's way back when you started
growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's over 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have experience there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did breeding come into play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, how long have you been
breeding and what made you get into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, OK, so it was about two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back around 2001, you know, well,
at this time, 1998, Mark Emory from your
[SPEAKER_01]: from your spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mark Emory was making a lot of noise in
the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing a lot of movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, being in the US,
it was difficult to get any type of beans
[SPEAKER_01]: from anywhere, especially in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: People were really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you had something going on,
you didn't talk about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would order from overseas,
whether it be Canada or whether it be,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the UK, Europe, whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest problem was that I remember
placing the order like in January.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, bro, it was like nine months later
when they showed up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I had like a couple of kids by
then, you know, but it was like it was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, man, it was like it was like,
man, I didn't know why it took so long to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when they got to me, the DJ short
that I did run was fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was like F2 or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: F2 or three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're up to five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it was good, but there was
always something that wasn't hitting Mark
[SPEAKER_01]: Emory had some pretty good stuff before he
ended up, you know, going under with the
[SPEAKER_01]: law and everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they would come over and I would I
would continue to grow these flowers,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't what I wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had a friend from California,
2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came over, came to pay me a visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we started hanging out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, man, how come I'm wondering,
why doesn't mine taste like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't it appeal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why doesn't it appeal to me the same way?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always thought it was my grow hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always thought it was something I was
doing wrong in the garden, something I
[SPEAKER_01]: wasn't wasn't working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my friend was like, it's genetics,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was really introduced to genetics
in 2001.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so he said, yeah, man, you got to have
good genetics to get good, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: get a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked him to bring me some, sell me some
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: He ended up going back to Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gave him a few hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: My man sent me like five beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was totally upset because I've
never, you know, the pricing and the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't say, man, what was the rest of
the beans?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, man, that's that's what you get
for good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So ended up growing that and it was like
off the hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right then I knew that, hey, I want to
dabble in breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, at that time, I dabbled and I was
pollen chucking, not knowing what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just crossing, crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stuff wasn't coming out,
not even better than overseas and not even
[SPEAKER_01]: better than Cali.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just wasn't right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how to pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know how to choose all the things
that come along with the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't I didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I put it on the back burner and it
wasn't until 2000.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was 2012, 2008 to 2012 and the
cookie drop out in Cali is when I picked
[SPEAKER_01]: it back up because I started delivery
service here in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a caregiver for about seven years
and I took care of a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, at that time, they allowed people to
care give.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my flower was just the same flowers
everybody else because we all had like the
[SPEAKER_01]: same cuttings and everybody was running
the same stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that, you know, breeding was a
way for me to really separate myself from
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody else in the crowd.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing I did was was go on
that journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could talk about it a lot later and go
in depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went on that journey to really start
to experiment and contacted some people
[SPEAKER_01]: who were able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, I bought a cutting for like
two thousand dollars and almost got me
[SPEAKER_01]: divorced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then the second cutting for
another two grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was sleeping on the couch for like
a month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my wife and people around me just
didn't understand what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember my buddy in Cali,
he said, Yo, man, if you're going to play
[SPEAKER_01]: this game, you got to have proper
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're just you're just another
small fish in the in the sea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's that's what I did,
man, is that I bought these expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started experimenting and then I started
to study and really dig down and try to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And long story short, I had one of the
best delivery services in the valley for
[SPEAKER_01]: many years called Speedy Nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so it just, you know,
that's really where it started because I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to be different and I wanted to
have something that nobody else had in
[SPEAKER_01]: some different type of varieties that
weren't like anybody else's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really that's really why I started.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's how you started getting into
breeding side of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fast forward to today, talking about
breeding setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can do breeding indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do breeding outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, what's your setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you indoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're indoors, what size room are you
in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Lighting, so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about your breeding setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I won't give you my entire process,
but I will I will share with you that it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes it takes a lot of people to get it
done the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you know, you can breed within
one compound, one tent, one compound,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, my process utilizes
friends, people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a commercial facility in Oklahoma
where we do our actual runs and we do our
[SPEAKER_01]: actual actual tests to to run many more
because here in the state of Arizona,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're on a we're in a limit and we're
limited to the amount that we can we can
[SPEAKER_01]: the flowers we can cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the the the main thing is that I knew
that I was limited with my caregiving card
[SPEAKER_01]: and and I knew that I I had to keep moms
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the same because I know I know
you're probably going to ask me about the
[SPEAKER_01]: males and pollen and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I focused more on the
ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I say more people helping out,
there's people who would carry the males.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one thing cool about being a
friend with a breeder is that,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, you know, I can give cuttings to
people who which I think are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the best and they hold on to the
cuttings.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep they flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They keep around and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we it is the winter that we
need, then I bring it back and then I do
[SPEAKER_01]: breed within.
[SPEAKER_01]: I breed within a tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take the best of the best females and
then work with the best of the best male.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have a process when I go through
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but I use a tent and I and I solo
everything out in the room, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: cut off the delivery service and just
really focused in on on honing that that
[SPEAKER_01]: craft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when we when we really want to do a
major funeral hunt, then we utilize
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma in that manner so we can pop one
hundred two hundred beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like right now, we're running the V12
and the V12.
[SPEAKER_01]: We pop, I think, around one hundred beans.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually around one hundred mark is a
good mark to for me anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my thought process of one hundred
to really get something swell out of
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't bring them back from Oklahoma
back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we do is we're we're able to to
identify and know that, hey, we have
[SPEAKER_01]: something special and, you know,
we possibly may breed out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we're not breeding out there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really, you know, I utilize a few
tents.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put the best females in the tent and
then I grab the best male that I can grab
[SPEAKER_01]: that I find out of maybe 15, 20 males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take the best male from that 15 to
20, depending on the rub, the smell test,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and then also, you know, what I want
to see out of the the crossing itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, yeah, I was going to ask you how many
plants you typically are hunting through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny, I was watching your video
where you're talking about breeding and
[SPEAKER_00]: you had mentioned that there have been
times where you've gone through a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't find what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you had to start fresh multiple times
that has happened to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like you have some real high
standards when it comes to finding exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just happened to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people from my network, they saw me
go down to Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went landless hunting in Costa Rica and
great experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Came back, was excited to do this run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did the run, made the crosses,
started to run some experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just wasn't happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know, in this game,
and if you a true breeder understands,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to be getting rid of more
than you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are you're going to be keeping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I'm big on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of, you know, I allow,
like I always say, I allow the the the
[SPEAKER_01]: beans to speak for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't run around the world
saying I'm the best and I'm the greatest
[SPEAKER_01]: or none of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The beans will speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, high quality health is
huge, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, man, there's it just
happened to me literally a few months ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: got rid of the females that I thought were
going to be the ones and she happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: herm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when she hermed, I'm just not
with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not I'm not with the herms and got rid
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If one of them herm within 20,
40 or, you know, vice versa, I really
[SPEAKER_01]: start to remove those and then pop more
because with, you know, it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: process I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really, really picky and anal
about making sure, you know, I get what I
[SPEAKER_01]: want out of the work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can definitely be a long, long process,
like you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: You touched upon a little bit on what
you're looking for in a phenol,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talk about stem rub a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to get a little bit deeper into
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What exactly do you look for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know this varies by breeder,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people look at the tricot production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people are looking for the vigor of
the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The list goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for in a cultivar
when making your decision on if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: suitable for breeding or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get our stuff tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So turf profile is obviously a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the levels, the TH levels,
making sure the levels are where I want
[SPEAKER_01]: them to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: The structure, the smell, the rub,
the rub smell means a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's a special skill in
itself, because out of 100 plants,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can rub each and every one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of know which way they're going
to be rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's characteristics that a lot of
plants carry, like the rubber rubber glue
[SPEAKER_01]: smell, like a brand new pair of shoes
smell, a grape, an apple or fruits,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the fruit type stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So myself, it's it's it's more than just
one thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's a full collage of what I'm
looking for and what I'm looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: express.
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, I created a one to one that
is very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: One to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's it was really close,
like a 17 to 15 on paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, going through that process,
it's like, OK, that's what makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: journey so long, because even though you
run, you can run 100 and doing the rub
[SPEAKER_01]: test, smell test, doing all this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm looking for on the left has to
make sense to the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the male the males that I'm looking
for, when I use to utilize the males,
[SPEAKER_01]: the males, I'm looking for strong
characteristics, strong characteristics
[SPEAKER_01]: that didn't help the female to go where
they need to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm also looking for balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not looking for one to overpower the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other like I'm known for the cookie,
you know, the balance of the cookie,
[SPEAKER_01]: not one being more powerful than the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we could sit here all day
and talk about how in the different ways
[SPEAKER_01]: that I then look for the feet,
the finos.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the honest to God truth, Chris,
it's it's truly like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: it boils down to to what the breeder is
looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And me, I'm known for the cookie because I
love the and I love the cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the cookie will have will have you
somewhere over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had you sleeping somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always look for that balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and that's just what I'm
known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I cannot explain how my
fingers rub on something, smell,
[SPEAKER_01]: rub on something, smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: People trip out on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's I believe it's a skill you
acquire over over years of experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because there's different
categories and there's nothing like I've
[SPEAKER_01]: recently saw some with some duck feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you heard of anything
about some duck feet type of genetic and
[SPEAKER_01]: and everything falls within a category,
you know, and from there is when I say,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, this is a OK, this is that you can
start to put things in the category.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, now when it comes down to
looking for that phenol or what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working on in the process, for instance,
a gorilla butter I'm working on,
[SPEAKER_01]: it didn't have size to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I already knew I had something that was
able to bring more size to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't want the balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want the size from the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't want the size from the left.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted I wanted the size from the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I wanted the left to be and speak and
to be more dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had to go through many, many,
many phenols to find that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Ron Hill from our group was able to
showcase that within our group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the journey's long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you find it, you're like,
yes, because you you hit it on the nails.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you got the what's on the left,
the characteristics and what's on the left
[SPEAKER_01]: is really shining and showcasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you've added extra weight to it
without without, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plan on the right wasn't what I was
looking for, but I needed the size and the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's a long it's a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I'm dabbling with now is is the
CRISPR and CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with
CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people aren't familiar with CRISPR,
but I'm going to take that journey
[SPEAKER_01]: because, you know, as a real breeder,
you're really looking to work with the
[SPEAKER_01]: DNA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get the A, B, C,
D, F, G, H, I.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working on those those letters.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with CRISPR, we're able to remove the
E, remove the F, add in the A's,
[SPEAKER_01]: the B's, the C's.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it kind of speeds up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes two years off of this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something we're working on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the phenol hunt, man, it's it's it is
a skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's truly a skill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you find the one that
you're looking for in your paper and your
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers match up, then the results,
you know, they speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be interesting to fast forward 10,
15 years and see DNA editing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gene editing and how it actually takes us,
you know, how far it actually takes us and
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're able to do with it in the
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's scary and exciting at the same time,
you know, because you get some funky stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they're talking about CRISPR with
human gene editing, which is just super
[SPEAKER_00]: scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants, I mean, it's similar.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I believe I believe I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I not only believe I mean, China and a few
other countries have shown us results of
[SPEAKER_01]: tripling and doubling and even mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for instance, that's why people love
blueberry, because it's mold resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you can grow it outdoor, indoor,
anywhere, and it's not going to collect
[SPEAKER_01]: any mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, inside of that DNA pattern,
you know, you could take that that DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: strand of helix and add it to another
added to another variety that is lacking
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could pull that out and put that
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm all for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to humans, that's totally
that's that's totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing the CRISPR being used
across the platform on plants in countries
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're getting low yield or they
need fast turnaround and faster cropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's not I don't think I
believe and know it will be the future of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants and food and things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you are playing God.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I mean, I mean,
it's no different than taking pollen and
[SPEAKER_01]: chucking and doing it's really it's really
no no different, you know, a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's really, you know,
you're you're actually making something
[SPEAKER_01]: better and much more something geared and
you're, like you said, cutting off two
[SPEAKER_01]: years of time, doing it the way we're
doing it now saves a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can definitely make things a lot
easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Circling back to the pollination process,
I want to get a little bit deeper into
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people will collect the pollen from
the males and then pollinate the females
[SPEAKER_00]: later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or some people will put the males in with
the females in the same room and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pollen sacs start to open and things start
to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They fly around the room, so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your style of doing the actual
pollination process?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've tried it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one I really enjoy is the natural
way of throwing the bad boy in there into
[SPEAKER_01]: into with the ladies and let them have
fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've stored pollen and,
you know, sometimes it doesn't work out
[SPEAKER_01]: as, you know, the best, you know,
the way you want it to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for myself, I definitely enjoy putting
the boy in the tent with the girls,
[SPEAKER_01]: let the party begin at a specific week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, I mean, that's that's the best
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have and I do collect the pollen,
especially if it's something that I really
[SPEAKER_01]: like and enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I would do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I will then also
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have friends in the valley who tissue
culture and they do their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I really want to keep a male
around as opposed to pollen, I will then
[SPEAKER_01]: make take a slither of a cutting and it's
a couple of my buddies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they will store that for a long
period of time, the very slow growth
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really helps me out a lot because
then I don't have mounds of pollen just
[SPEAKER_01]: just everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that's why it's really important when
you you want to get into breeding or
[SPEAKER_01]: you're breeding in your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that pollens flying around
everywhere, man, it's it's it could be it
[SPEAKER_01]: could be a bad site for the next breeding
or the next process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really got to use utilize the
filtration properly, bleach and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: things are sanitized properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually use like an ozone and kill
everything in the room at the end of each
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kill anything that's living in the room
and make sure that that there's nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: else living in that can jeopardize the
next process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, me putting the boy in the in the
tent, I found to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, it's like apple trees,
you know, when you got a male tree outside
[SPEAKER_01]: and a female tree outside, they just seem
to work well together.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's the way nature,
the way it's intended to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I have taken pollen and
dabble, but it doesn't produce as well as
[SPEAKER_01]: as putting the boy inside of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something special happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I definitely agree with you on that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just finished up a run where I had the
male in there with the females and just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, at a certain day, just shaking
the male over all the females and just
[SPEAKER_00]: completely covering them, you know,
and then killing off the male.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I didn't need it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I harvested now,
you know, broke up the plant loaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're looking for like to yield as
many seeds as possible, you'll probably
[SPEAKER_00]: get a better result if you're shaking the
plant in there, you know, and just you
[SPEAKER_00]: will need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done it with, you know, a little swab
and swabbing different branches and stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't get as much coverage,
doesn't produce as many seeds as keeping
[SPEAKER_00]: the male in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought that was a big major call
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you know, it's cool is
that, you know, after you do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I have a ritual I do you with my
males in there and we do a little we do
[SPEAKER_01]: our little native thing on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, you only need to do it a
few times and then get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's you know, then you can start your
cleaning process outside in the room and
[SPEAKER_01]: you really start to sanitize outside of
the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's just just a little dabble
over the entire crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, you're you're you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because even the leaves carry some of the
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when your fans are moving around in the
tent, you know, it's still going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to move around as the plant
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to ask, how long is pollen good
for and how do you properly store pollen
[SPEAKER_00]: for later use?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I've not ever kept pollen over a
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not I'm not sure after the year
mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I'm going to use something and work
with something, I usually give it that
[SPEAKER_01]: year time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could it be longer?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure, because I like I said,
if I'm going to use something a year later
[SPEAKER_01]: from now or something later down the road,
because I do backcrossing as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: then I would I would go tissue culture and
tissue culture because you're able to the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant continues to grow, but it grows at a
very, very slow rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The male plant that is that's the way that
I keep my male around as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, you can keep the pollen in
the fridge is the best place to keep it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually stores longer than if you just
keep it in a room at room temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You keep it in a in a fridge and a
refrigerator and things just it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you got to be
careful because the pollen, if you pull it
[SPEAKER_01]: out, the moisture can make the pollen a
bit sticky and gunky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, tissue culture is just the way
to go if you're really trying to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, keep the keep the male genetic
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people, they don't understand
tissue culturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even teach you culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people then store and do what they
need to do for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a that's the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you've pollinated your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing, they're producing seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: At what point do you know when to harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, like I like the tap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found out that tapping the ladies in a
room week three is probably the best,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if you want to keep your flower
and you want to press the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could do one good shake around week
three.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, remove the excess and the plant
then starts to develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This the seeds will finish in week six.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be finished if you allow them to
go any longer, which I try not to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then after about week seven, eight,
they then start to because there's
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture they then start to open up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So around six to eight, I really I'm
really watching the development of the of
[SPEAKER_01]: the seeds and watching the development of
everything taking shape.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't focus on the plant anymore,
meaning that I'm not I'm not looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the trikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not deep into the nature of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking at the crickets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not every seed is designed the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some some finish fascinating others.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last blueberry we just recreated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finished really fast to the point that at
week seven, it started already cracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The seeds started to crack open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I knew I had a pooler and get her out
of there real fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, didn't give us time to flush or
any of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my vibranium in my V12, you know,
they can run a full eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then them suckers are themselves are
like little boulders, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they're really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you have the beans that are really
tough and hard, you know, like my Cartier
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very, very strong bean,
which means that it needs to go the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really from week six to week eight is
when anything after week eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I think people are messing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if it hurts the seedling.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, you can't get the seedling
to start to open up because of the added
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like tucked in this ball of of
moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may want to it may want to start to
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen that I'm sure you've seen
that pictures and online, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds growing from a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually haven't seen that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, usually the you know, I see the calyx
open up and then the seed will kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: drop off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing that I kind of heard
in the past is like once you start having
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds start to drop out of there each day,
or even if you like touch the plant a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit, all of a sudden these seeds
are falling out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you probably want to harvest the
plant at that time, because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds are probably developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, my next question would be when you
harvest and you're breaking up the buds
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got your seed there,
it's pretty much impossible to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred percent developed seeds,
a percentage of them are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: undeveloped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other percentage is going to
be fully developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is a good percentage in your
experience or your opinion developed
[SPEAKER_00]: versus undeveloped seeds at harvest time?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, so you've got to understand,
you've got to understand what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working with, because it boils back down
to the time frame.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, if you crop out at six,
week six, then more than likely you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have a higher percentage of
undeveloped.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you allow it to go to week eight,
you're going to have a better chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: having the beans not be developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, people talk about white seeds,
gray seeds, brown seeds, tiger stripe,
[SPEAKER_01]: all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Cartier cookie puts off gray,
white seeds, so it can trick you into
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that it's not developed,
but it's really developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you, boy, it goes back to understanding
the genetic and what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the if the CG pop prior were gray
whites, which I love the gray whites,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people say, oh, they're not
developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not understanding because the
grays, man, they put off the most trikes
[SPEAKER_01]: to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I'm working with that,
I know what I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I watch that time frame because when
come six and seven, especially eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: I pulled down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had there's a better chance of getting
your your ratios would be definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, yeah, when you make it to the latter
part of the of the growth cycle,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, of course, the beans are still
developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you win and you're cropping
at the proper time, then you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have a better ratio by far, you know,
better ratio in your week seven and week
[SPEAKER_01]: eight of pulling down anything after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant is still going to continue to
grow and continue to flowers or not
[SPEAKER_01]: herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pollen is going to continue to be
around and it's going to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like I said, if you crop it week six,
which I know a lot of people do because
[SPEAKER_01]: they they want they don't care about the
ratio, they're just going to pull out the
[SPEAKER_01]: best because they're working with limited
amounts of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, when you're when you're
speeding up like that, you don't get a
[SPEAKER_01]: good pop rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another thing is that when you
do wait the time and then you do this
[SPEAKER_01]: start to germinate, you get a better
germination rate when you wait better,
[SPEAKER_01]: better percentage as well of of beans as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I know there are so many
different ways to go about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but kind of generally speaking,
how many generations are you going to in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to get your desired result?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, many people have they they
work it a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I get down to F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at my F3 mark is really my telltale,
because when you're in your F1,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Varieties from an F1, I mean, cousins,
aunties, uncles, you get you get it all
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you start moving down and you start
pulling back, it's around week.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around the F3 where I really start to
dwindle it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when you can really start to
see the prize and stuff happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, because it is an F3 and because I'm
constantly inbreeding in a way,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, at times the F3, I will then
bring in an outside to come into the F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't hurt the genetic makeup and
create mutants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because you can really mess up the
genetic, the makeup of of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really depends on where I'm at in
F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: But F3 is kind of where I'm like,
OK, you know, I know I have something
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if I make it to F3 and it's happened
to me before it three years actually of
[SPEAKER_01]: working on a genetic, I made it to my F3s
and nothing in the F3s I like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I mean, I mean,
hundreds of beans later, and there's just
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing just wasn't matching up with what
I like, because if I want the if I want
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, I'm looking for balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if if I don't find that balance,
then it's not worth continuing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I might as well run the beans that that
favor more to this side or run the beans
[SPEAKER_01]: that favor more to this side, as opposed
to trying to really recreate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I do something special after F3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: F3s are really important to me and to
stabilize in genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you go to F3s and then you cross
with something I think you mentioned in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do back crossing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk to us about back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is back crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, back crossing really stabilizes the
genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how you're able to without fimming,
be able to go back to the original
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, my process is whenever I'm working on
the line off the F1, I keep the female
[SPEAKER_01]: that I really enjoy because that's the
staple.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the one saying, hey, we're really
trying to match and get as close to her as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, the male is
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I make it down to the F3,
that's when I'm ready to come back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I come back to that mom,
what I've done is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, I started with F1.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting 500 different looks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I get down to F3,
I've really doing to the down to specific
[SPEAKER_01]: looks that I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when I come back to that mama,
baby, I'm rocking and rolling because now
[SPEAKER_01]: my my my it's like here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm working with four or five,
six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you get around from three to
twelve looks on the back cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not exactly the same,
but each bean you pop off of, they are
[SPEAKER_01]: really going to be within that three to
six variety look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where it really gets the magic,
you know, starts to happen is when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the BX one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, some products, some stuff
that's on the BX two BX threes and real
[SPEAKER_01]: consistency, consistency, consistency,
because I'm not a feminized type of reader
[SPEAKER_01]: at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I don't rock that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back crossing takes so long that people
aren't willing to spend the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: energy and money to stabilize something.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are just trying to you know,
it's a great market right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live in one of the greatest markets in
the world right now when it comes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are trying to make money left
and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not they're not trying to
produce the best product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just trying to produce product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: So back crossing is the way and the only
way to go unless you're using a CRISPR
[SPEAKER_01]: program to eliminate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, going to F3 is the CRISPR
in essence.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're doing is is the natural
form of CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you come back to the
original mom, you got the original mom,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you got those other varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then bam, you got a closer knit group
of what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now what about self crossing?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I stay away from self crossing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I stay away from feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have people hit me up all the time
saying I would grab from you if you have
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, self crossing, man,
it's two ways that it's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stressing the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're stressing the plant to either
hermaphrodite itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that's not the form you're taking,
and it's true, you will get the same
[SPEAKER_01]: almost the same quality or the same
genetic if you do self, you do it to
[SPEAKER_01]: itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're going to get the offspring
that looks just like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what a lot of people don't know is you
are really deterred.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are tearing up that genetic,
because then it doesn't reproduce like it
[SPEAKER_01]: should.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't, you know, of course,
we would love to see LeBron James cloned
[SPEAKER_01]: over and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that next LeBron, he might have an ear
on top of his head.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's like, yo, man,
hold up LeBron Bron.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can hear me on top of your head,
Bron Bron.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yo, so and that's what we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing and I've seen this happen,
Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen F1s go against my F1s and F3s
and back crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen feminized go against and I
don't want to say go against, but the
[SPEAKER_01]: structure of an S1 does not look anything
like, you know, the original process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it boils back down again to the
marketing side of things when it comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: S1.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know guys that S1 and they have
great products and they and it looks great
[SPEAKER_01]: and all, but their plan isn't as vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't as healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they're ready to clone and
they're ready to move that genetic down
[SPEAKER_01]: the line, it doesn't happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They the makeup goes like this and the
client and the offspring aren't producing
[SPEAKER_01]: like they want them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really like one and done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get it, once you do it,
boom, it's over, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it comes to FIMs, hey,
man, I'm not big into, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: spraying my plant with chemical,
you know, to make herself freak herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then she stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's how that's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then people ask me, well, you know,
my plants aren't herming and the office,
[SPEAKER_01]: da, da, da.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, but I bet you've lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: A quarter of the weight, maybe half of the
weight or, you know, some type of
[SPEAKER_01]: structural condition or, you know,
there's just so much that goes that's in
[SPEAKER_01]: the negative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a breeder myself, you know,
I'm from the old school, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe in Mother Nature and I
believe in the natural process because
[SPEAKER_01]: then it isn't lying to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not lying to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, Feminize Seeds,
I mean, as a beginning grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you don't want I mean,
I hear people say, oh, my God,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got four out of 12.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four were males.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's it's the nature of the of
the regular bean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, people would dig to the
FIMs and then six months later,
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear, how come my plants aren't
producing like they should?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, man, I don't even like to
speak on it because I've already told you
[SPEAKER_01]: six months ago what the deal was and what
the demo was.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like I said, this game is
not a game of trial and error.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you want to play trial and
error, then you're going to spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, a lot of time, you know,
going two, three months, two, three
[SPEAKER_01]: months, two, three months of trial and
error.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, oh, man, I get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand why people use FIMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's great for beginners to get
their hands in the in the soil and the
[SPEAKER_01]: clay and start playing with the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you're ready to get serious about
your your flower and your genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: bro, none is really going to be the regs,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my take on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could sit here and talk on and on
and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to start to wrap things
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just got a couple of final questions for
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is really for the folks that
are new to breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What advice do you have for those folks
that are new to breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot of time, money,
focus and consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And becoming a breeder, you know,
it's it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not going to lay down the
cake for awesome genetics to start with,
[SPEAKER_01]: always use this analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I explain stuff to people,
you know, if Michael Jordan and and let's
[SPEAKER_01]: say Lisa Leslie had a baby, you're going
to get some pretty good offspring.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's the way it may grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you may pop off some seven footers
who are just jumping out the gym.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's just that's just the way it
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even with dogs like you don't see,
you don't see breeders reaching for the
[SPEAKER_01]: mutt that came around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're not looking for that mutt
that came around the corner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it looks like three, four different
other varieties, you know, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, oh, I'm going to make a champion
out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I used to breed dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I came into this, it was the same
way, same philosophy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why it put me on the couch and
why I was almost divorced, because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I invested into the proper
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody's out there and they're
saying, hey, I want to go on this journey
[SPEAKER_01]: and become one of the best breeders known
to mankind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Start.
[SPEAKER_01]: It starts with genetics and it starts with
regular genetics, not something feminized,
[SPEAKER_01]: not something even a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get away from the clone game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, I had to learn that as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, hey, taking a clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't know how many times that plan
has been cloned.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't know the history of that of
that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: People lie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that doesn't numbers don't
lie is the only thing that's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So invest into invest into your your
genetics, number one, but then also cut
[SPEAKER_01]: out trying to flower in the same area as
as you're trying to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to make a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't chase two rabbits because you'll
catch none.
[SPEAKER_01]: So either you're going to be growing
flower for yourself or you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're going to be a breeder,
you got to be a breeder 100 percent 24 7
[SPEAKER_01]: or it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and the big it was a big roll of
the dice when I decided to go full time
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the only reason why I did
because there were a lot of individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: who were getting in pain so much for for
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, man, I just wanted to help
people out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I say.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be someone who helps people
out in this game and give people an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity, then, hey, reach for the best
genetics and go 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't go 50 percent at becoming a breeder
and do not practice pollen chucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that that will land you in hot
water and a lot of people not wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: purchase anything from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some good advice there all
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So wrapping things up, how can the
listeners find you and what do you have
[SPEAKER_00]: upcoming in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can Google me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always wanted to say that in this G
club dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can catch me there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cartier crops dot com.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I help people out in the game
and and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the future, you know, I'm really
focused in on Oklahoma right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma, you know, here in the states is
really allowing us to do our thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see the brand back here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have it on packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just finished our second crop and it'll
be distributed all through the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was a dream and a vision.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was an idea that started.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to be able to wake each day and,
you know, move forward because you fail
[SPEAKER_01]: many, many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as long as you continue to move your
feet one and in front of the other,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a success every single day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this back here and what's about to
happen in Oklahoma is with something that
[SPEAKER_01]: that's just been planned and it's working
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really excited to see that face on
packages and have product within the
[SPEAKER_01]: market of Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's a conflict with me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continue to breed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to breed, but it takes a lot of
time, energy and money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not too sure how long I'll do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as long as I'm here and I'm
breathing and I have the resources and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything around to continue to breed,
then I'm about that life, man,
[SPEAKER_01]: because recreation is pretty dope.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to say this before you wrap up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ups to you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big ups to you and for what you do in the
community, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I jumped online four years ago,
five years ago, you're like one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: first people I saw online.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually I was like, hey, this dude is
doing something really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to help people too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you inspired myself to get up and make
things happen and to help people and use
[SPEAKER_01]: the best side of my of my passion to help
people move along.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, big ups to you,
because a lot of people know you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people respect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people enjoy to listen to the
podcast and listen to you and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm glad you made the transition from
the teaching to really bringing other
[SPEAKER_01]: people in to then hear other stories and
hear other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a great move on your behalf and
big ups to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your positive words.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool to hear that you've
been following me back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was an inspiration for you to get
going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really happy for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it seems like you've got your shit
together and you're doing some really good
[SPEAKER_00]: things in this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like you're using the
technology in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about CRISPR and all that stuff
to advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty cool.

[SPEAKER_00]: Every single weekend I'm releasing a new
Garden Talk podcast episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would love for you to tune into
future episodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cartier, thank you so much for coming out
to this podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool to hear your story,
how you do things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to see what you have going
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peace out, everyone.
