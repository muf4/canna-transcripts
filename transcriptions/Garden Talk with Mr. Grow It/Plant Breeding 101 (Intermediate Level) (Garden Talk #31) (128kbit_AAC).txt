[SPEAKER_00]: Coming up on Garden Talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hollow stem compared to a solid stem
will relate to typically higher production
[SPEAKER_01]: in trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can stress a female out and make her
create nanas, then that means that her
[SPEAKER_01]: macroditic trait is dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her pain profiles from that stem rub,
I always stress that it's so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: One particular alleles, or one particular
version per gene, that is homozygous
[SPEAKER_01]: status.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want to achieve.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you see F2, F2, F2, that's when we've
opened up to the most choices of
[SPEAKER_01]: phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our characteristics and our alleles is
what we call them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we start our selective
breeding process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get discouraged.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand that it's going to take your
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand that you definitely are going
to have to have a passion for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to have a love for it because this
is literally your life's work.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up, everybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: For you that don't know me, my name is
Chris, AKA Mr. Grow It, and you're tuned
[SPEAKER_00]: into the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is episode number 31.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this episode, I interview Zaza
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has been gardening for six years and he
grows a variety of plants such as collard
[SPEAKER_00]: greens, tomatoes, squash, kale,
medicinal varieties, and watermelons.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is also a breeder and that's what we're
going to be getting into today.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been breeding for 15 years,
starting out with dogs, then transitioned
[SPEAKER_00]: over to plant breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this podcast episode, he talks about
plant breeding on an intermediate level.

[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's get into the episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to the Garden Talk podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I am joined with Zaza from Zaza
Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for having me man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to have you on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to talk about breeding today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually did a video with Vader OG
from OceanGrow Genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: A while back we did a beginner video on
breeding and this one I feel like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get more into more intermediate
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now some of these questions some of you
might ask and they might say you've
[SPEAKER_00]: already talked about this on the last
video.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of things with breeding I feel
like are subjective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we start talking about traits
and stuff that breeders look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to get into all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why some of those questions are
asked on both that video as well as this
[SPEAKER_00]: video or podcast episode I should say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I did actually have people
submitted questions through Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're not following me on Instagram
at MrDocGrowit follow me on there and you
[SPEAKER_00]: get a chance to ask questions in the
future to feature guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we actually get into the nitty
gritty of plant breeding can you tell us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit about yourself and how you got
into gardening?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Swam originally from New Jersey
born and raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my initial passion for gardening
started ironically sounds weird but it
[SPEAKER_01]: started with dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We learned the family tree of dogs and
that kind of ended up learning through
[SPEAKER_01]: research that it was well connected with
plants as well in gardening.
[SPEAKER_01]: My gardening experience started about five
years ago outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegetables, kale, collard greens all the
good stuff especially it kicked up really
[SPEAKER_01]: in the last couple years with the whole
virus thing and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wanted to kick up their immune
system and you know so we get into all the
[SPEAKER_01]: natural plants and medicines and that's
kind of where my gardening started about
[SPEAKER_01]: five years ago outside actually with the
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice and I know before we started
recording you had talked about how you
[SPEAKER_00]: started with dog breeding 15 years ago and
how a lot of that knowledge actually
[SPEAKER_00]: transfers over to plants which I thought
was pretty interesting and we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get deeper into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to ask in your opinion what makes a
reputable breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know why are you a reputable breeder?
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was a good question from
somebody through Instagram that asked
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely that's important too that's a
really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as me transparency and education
like that's the most important thing being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to educate not only your friends and
your fellow grommies or gardeners but also
[SPEAKER_01]: you know if you have followers if you have
customers whatever your niche is whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: you have educate each one teach one and I
think that's what makes a reputable
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being open with everybody you deal with.
Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there was somebody who asked a
question through Instagram he's got a very
[SPEAKER_00]: small space and he wants to know how much
space do you need to microbreed I guess
[SPEAKER_00]: you can call it right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like the smallest space that you
can actually breed in?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a new term but it's new to me but
it doesn't take much space at all that's
[SPEAKER_01]: the good thing about breeding you know
when you think in terms of gardening you
[SPEAKER_01]: tend to need a lot of space as far as
generally creating vegetables and flowers
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you tend to need more space but
when it comes to making seeds you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need as much space typically ideally two
by four tenths if you cook two tenths
[SPEAKER_01]: would even be better you know but that's
pretty much all you would need.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your setup look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I run a two by two I'm sorry two by four I
also run a four by four I did have a two
[SPEAKER_01]: by two up but I took it down my mother I
have a mother Mac one which typically got
[SPEAKER_01]: way too big she's about eight feet tall
she got way too big for her two by two so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't use anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha so as a home grower you can
definitely do breeding you know just a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple tenths you can definitely get away
with it so that's cool here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk about selection process so
this is where it's kind of like it's gets
[SPEAKER_00]: into subjective right it comes down to
breeders preference okay so starting with
[SPEAKER_00]: male plants how do you select your male
plants for breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: So male plants is a tricky one too because
typically you'll never really know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really hard to determine what traits a
male is gonna pass off to a female
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring you know it's kind of like
similar to like you know if a dad the dad
[SPEAKER_01]: is gonna be hard to look at look at a dad
and say I wonder what his daughter's bra
[SPEAKER_01]: size may be once she is born you know it's
really similar to that and we we have ways
[SPEAKER_01]: and tricks that we that we can kind of you
know use our best kind of give us the best
[SPEAKER_01]: idea of what will be a good true male
breeder and stem rub stimulation of the
[SPEAKER_01]: you know getting kind of getting the idea
what those terpenes strong terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles and that typically will relate to
good flavors and strong plants ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and as well hollow stem a hollow
stem usually compared to a solid stem will
[SPEAKER_01]: relate to typically higher content as far
as production in trichomes if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that you're interested in and
probably the biggest one structure as well
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and bigger bigger is probably
the biggest one a vigorous growing plant
[SPEAKER_01]: vigorous growing plant is going to be one
that you want to using your you know your
[SPEAKER_00]: system your line gotcha now I know some
breeders they'll stress their plants you
[SPEAKER_00]: know whether they do training or some
folks will let their plants go naturally
[SPEAKER_00]: do you let your plants kind of grow
naturally Christmas tree style or are you
[SPEAKER_00]: like training your plants and kind of
stressing them out in certain ways to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of help determine whether or not that's a
selectable plant absolutely stress testing
[SPEAKER_01]: is very important as well at different
stages you definitely want to stress test
[SPEAKER_01]: the male for the selection process and
that's probably the only reason I would
[SPEAKER_01]: ever train a potential male for you know
breeding will be to stress test training
[SPEAKER_01]: defoliating bending twisting turning all
of that good stuff that's pretty much you
[SPEAKER_01]: would only do it for that reason not
necessarily for flower production now what
[SPEAKER_00]: about like feeding I guess kind of in
relation to stress testing in a sense to
[SPEAKER_00]: you kind of give them like a lack of
nutrients I think some breeders do that
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll run low on the nutrients or
they'll try to go heavy on the nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of stress and see how the plant
evolves and then kind of make their
[SPEAKER_01]: decision off of that do you do any of that
or uh well spike in nitrogen is typically
[SPEAKER_01]: good a really high spike in nitrogen kind
of give it a little overdose of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: will be a good you know stressor I don't
necessarily me personally I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: underfeed it's um I think it'll take too
long to kind of get the results that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: looking for as to where a spike in
nitrogen is going to give you that instant
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of indication of this plant and
whether it can you know how hardy it is
[SPEAKER_00]: okay that makes sense so the plants been
growing male plant you have identified
[SPEAKER_00]: male plant you flipped it over to the
light cycle for example now it starts
[SPEAKER_00]: producing pollen sacks pollen sacks
produce you know the first time I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: grew a male plant seeing the pollen sacks
within a couple weeks and like opening
[SPEAKER_00]: within I think within three weeks like I
thought it was just super quick you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and I wasn't expecting that the first time
around do you collect pollen and save it
[SPEAKER_00]: and store it for breeding in the future or
do you just let your males grow to a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain point put them in with females and
kind of let them get down and dirty so I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean ideally you want to do the latter you
want to be able to sit a male in there
[SPEAKER_01]: with the females and ultimately through my
experience I've seen a difference in seed
[SPEAKER_01]: production bigger beautiful seeds and
better offspring even the female they seem
[SPEAKER_01]: to react to knowing that the male is in
the tent with them and they seem to perk
[SPEAKER_01]: up they seem to be happier it just seems
like a better experience overall for the
[SPEAKER_01]: females but that's always not ideal as far
as you know you can't always do it so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: much more convenient to have pollen stored
and be able to you know just put it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know self or just pollinate the plant
especially in the terms of when you when
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to store pollen for back crossing
back crossing is very important when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're trying to stabilize the line so
that is you have to store pollen for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part in that sense can you tell us
how you store the pollen well I would
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much well depending on whether it's
auto flower or photo period it's a really
[SPEAKER_01]: big difference so like you said like an
actual male plant is gonna have an
[SPEAKER_01]: avalanche of pollen like it's gonna be
impossible not to you know it's so easy to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect it you pretty much just want to
make sure that you dry it out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: store it within a whether you want to
store it long term you want to put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer in a little glass jar or you know
or in the refrigerator if you plan to use
[SPEAKER_01]: it really soon but auto flowers is a much
more intricate process you're gonna really
[SPEAKER_01]: have to go in and actually use tweezers
and pull the pollen sacks in most cases
[SPEAKER_01]: the pollen is much less viable it's much
less there it's barely any so you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect it by tweezers as many as you can
pollen sack by pollen sack at that point I
[SPEAKER_01]: would then use a strainer like a bowl
strainer I would use the bowl strainer and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of shake shake everything I got in
the bowl strainer to get the little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen if so if I can get it that way
perfect if not much comes out then we got
[SPEAKER_01]: to kind of individually break each one
open with the tweezers and remove each and
[SPEAKER_01]: every pollen sack because that's when you
get into moisture moisture can destroy
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen very easily immediately and make it
non-viable so you have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you typically I use dehumidifiers as well
when I'm collecting pollen in that room
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to lay it out flat on the table
if possible have a dehumidifier keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity at least 40 or below if possible
you know that's the ideal setting for
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen you want to let it dry out for a
couple hours make sure it's completely dry
[SPEAKER_01]: no pollen sacks are in there clean it out
good and then you can collect it once it's
[SPEAKER_01]: dry and stored and like same way with
regular mail with freezer or fridge okay
[SPEAKER_00]: that makes sense somebody through
Instagram asked I don't know if this is
[SPEAKER_00]: true or not they said they hear that
keeping pollen and baking soda baking
[SPEAKER_00]: powder can help so would mixing the pollen
into baking powder in order to stabilize
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidity work I wouldn't do it
personally I've never heard that method
[SPEAKER_01]: myself personally but it's not something I
mean it's always something worth looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into or you know we learn every day so
I'll definitely be looking into that after
[SPEAKER_00]: the show I tell you that yeah it was the
first time I've ever heard of it either I
[SPEAKER_00]: thought it was an interesting question to
bring up so let's get into a female plants
[SPEAKER_00]: so you know selecting the female what do
you do what characteristics you look for
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth so the female selection
process is a lot more fun in my opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: you know everyone loves females you know
so in this case it starts really early and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why you know that's why we use or
that's why I use the power the paper towel
[SPEAKER_01]: and germination is that's that's when the
selection process starts in many cases if
[SPEAKER_01]: those tap roots don't come out really
vigorous and strong you know I'll put them
[SPEAKER_01]: to the side you know I'll mark them but
you know you want to start that selection
[SPEAKER_01]: process right there within that paper
towel and that's when the fun begins you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you get to actually see and you know
you do the same stem rubs and but you you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you know it's gonna be a female so
you pretty much it's a visible it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: visible thing when you have multiple
plants to select from typically you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you just got to know what to look for so
you're you're even from the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: you're killing off plants right away from
when they're seed now are you looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: things while they're growing in veg
seedlings are you wiping out seedlings are
[SPEAKER_01]: you wiping out seeds yeah not all the
seeds are gonna make it out of the paper
[SPEAKER_01]: towel even even the ones that have decent
tap roots that they may not you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking for real real bigger then I
need to make sure I'm only picking the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest strongest ones with the biggest
strongest tap roots and then from there
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah absolutely we we start the stress
test on females pretty early as well so
[SPEAKER_01]: because um you know that hermaphroditic
trait can that's when it'll come out and
[SPEAKER_01]: the female pretty early during the veg
stage whether it's light or you know heat
[SPEAKER_01]: or those are typically even use artificial
wind you know just blowing high winds on
[SPEAKER_01]: it and nitrogen spikes and things like
that typically if that if that trait is
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant we just want to we can bring it
out pretty pretty early during the veg
[SPEAKER_01]: stage in a few minutes pretty easy so you
get the female plant growing all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower you know as it's going along
you're you're you're killing off plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are there any particular characteristics
that you're looking for in the female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant I don't know if you touched on that
typically the same that we look for within
[SPEAKER_01]: a a male besides arm it's just it's just a
lot more obvious like trichome production
[SPEAKER_01]: of course when you know we get those
trichomes really early and all hanging out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the fan leaves and you know those are
always really good signs you know terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles from that stem robot always
stress that is so important on my lives we
[SPEAKER_01]: always do it as a fun you know fun thing
together we get up there and we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbing and we're like hey oh my gosh you
know you know it's always but it's such an
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing because it really does
give you those profiles and gives you an
[SPEAKER_01]: idea and you can you can see the
differences even within the same genes you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you can see the differences and smell
the differences and that's that's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: selector for me and but but during the
late flower stage you just kind of just
[SPEAKER_01]: want to you're focusing so much at that
point it begins so much on seed production
[SPEAKER_01]: at that point so you kind of you kind of
back off what we typically would normally
[SPEAKER_01]: be using for a normal medicinal plant and
producing flower you know the phosphorus
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the potassium and you know we
kind of kind of back I mean potassium is
[SPEAKER_01]: okay but the phosphorus and stuff we
typically back off and kind of just keep
[SPEAKER_01]: running a little nitrogen and and whatever
else we mean
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so you've actually selected the
female within the flower stage at the
[SPEAKER_00]: point where it needs to be pollinated you
don't actually grow a plant take clones
[SPEAKER_01]: finish off plants well yeah for males
mostly we use cloning as a big for males
[SPEAKER_01]: but um with females I don't necessarily
have to cut as many clones you always do
[SPEAKER_01]: as a precaution typically just to be sure
and always be able to go back but males
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes you're cutting two clones per
male just to make sure that they all get
[SPEAKER_01]: out there successfully you know you want
to test them and make sure it's just a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more testing clones with the male than it
is a female okay so you are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: completing the female smoking it and then
taking the clones of that female and using
[SPEAKER_01]: that to pollinate yeah that's a lot of
painful yeah typically you know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much the whole program is cloning
male and female mostly cloning because you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to be able to go back in reveging we
do some reveging at times with females we
[SPEAKER_01]: revege I particularly don't do it as much
because we got cloning you know as long as
[SPEAKER_01]: you're working with a that's why I try to
select early on in the process so we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have too many females to have to clone
from but with males you kind of this is a
[SPEAKER_01]: much tougher process you you know I try to
use other other people to help me in that
[SPEAKER_01]: case when it comes to males because males
you don't want to even sit them together
[SPEAKER_01]: you know even separated from females even
them together they'll even cross pollinate
[SPEAKER_01]: each other like not well not you know but
you don't want pollen from one male being
[SPEAKER_01]: or another male that you you know because
it happens so you want to actually
[SPEAKER_01]: separate them individually as well you
know it gets kind of tricky so clones are
[SPEAKER_00]: very important okay that makes sense and
now around what day of flower do you
[SPEAKER_01]: typically pollinate the females ah well we
try to pollinate exactly around the time
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're seeing those first white
pistols start to bunch up we've seen those
[SPEAKER_01]: white pistols because we know those are
the pistols that typically catch that
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and whether you are if you have a
male just hanging in there you might want
[SPEAKER_01]: to you know just shake a shake a little
bit in there and you know you always kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of want to start your male off earlier you
know you want to start the male off
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and once because the females gonna
take you know especially with a regular
[SPEAKER_01]: male it's not much you really have to do
in that case unless you you stored pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: you're bringing it back to artificially
disseminate okay and then what's the ideal
[SPEAKER_00]: flower time once pollinated for healthy
seeds that's a good question yes so
[SPEAKER_01]: typically seeded flowers take longer to
develop they usually take longer than an
[SPEAKER_01]: unseeded female and in general seven weeks
eight weeks typically you'll generally
[SPEAKER_01]: notice this when it comes to see you know
seeds in general it's a really visual
[SPEAKER_01]: thing not really much you can sort of sort
of similar to trichomes it's really visual
[SPEAKER_01]: thing you know once you see the casing
kind of crack or you know you kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: visually see the seed it looks like it's
developed based on color and size that's
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty much all you determine determining
factors right there I gotta imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics has something to do with it as
well right if you have like a 12 weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering strain right it'll probably need
to go longer than the seven eight weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: that you mentioned so but yeah I mean I
think you bring up a good point is like
[SPEAKER_00]: because I've technically I'm a breeder
yeah I don't call myself a breeder but
[SPEAKER_00]: Vader OG called me a breeder because I did
one cross I made one cross it was brisker
[SPEAKER_00]: OG cross with Pakistan Valley so
technically I'm a breeder but I know
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what you mean when you say that
it's kind of like you can see like the
[SPEAKER_00]: calyxes open with the seed popping out and
you can see that the color of the seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on and so forth so you can kind of
get an idea then it's visible so I totally
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what you mean by that one okay
so I know the answer to this next question
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm still gonna ask it just because
there's an audience here that probably
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't know the answer some people don't
know the answer should pollen from a
[SPEAKER_00]: female producing nanners be used for
breeding so the bananas the the male
[SPEAKER_01]: stamen that comes out it depends on how
the manners were created so if we have
[SPEAKER_01]: purposely stress the female to create
manners in a sense of like light stress or
[SPEAKER_01]: heat stress that's not and then we we
bring that that hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic trait out to the forefront
then it was dominant in the first place
[SPEAKER_01]: right so we don't want to use that for
breeding stuff now in a sense where
[SPEAKER_01]: manners were created by the female herself
in that last ditch effort to you know self
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate and preserve her own genetics in
that sense she wasn't that that most
[SPEAKER_01]: likely that hermaphroditic trait wasn't
dominant in her she did it herself you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it towards the end thinking like oh
you know this the end of my life cycle got
[SPEAKER_01]: a pollen I haven't been pollinated got a
pollen so in that sense it's really good
[SPEAKER_01]: because technically that's a self
pollination which the offspring of every
[SPEAKER_01]: self pollination are going to be 50% more
stable and so that's why I say it gets
[SPEAKER_01]: tricky when we use the term hermaphrodite
or Hermi it's really important in knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: how it was developed and you know we've
got two different type of Hermes
[SPEAKER_01]: technically we have on ball sacks which
which typically come from us reversing a
[SPEAKER_01]: female whether we're using colloidal
silver or jabiric acid or whatever method
[SPEAKER_01]: you're using within stopping the product
the production of ethylene and and causing
[SPEAKER_01]: the female to then create male parts so in
that case that's also not the
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic trait most likely is not
dominant in that case it's most likely
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive and you know depending on you
know it could be either way but you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you would know if you know in that case
because we wouldn't use it in the first
[SPEAKER_01]: place but in that case yes most likely not
dominant it would be dominant in the case
[SPEAKER_01]: where we use stress to create nanos yeah
that's that's not good we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: use that as breeding stock okay we'll get
deeper into feminizing in a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: here I want to stick on hermaphrodites for
one few more questions here so should
[SPEAKER_00]: pollen from pollen sacks coming from a
hermaphrodite so the hermaphrodite I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about is say the plant grows flip
it over the flower start to own pistols
[SPEAKER_00]: shortly after you see pollen sacks there
should that be used for breeding no so
[SPEAKER_01]: that is what we're talking about in the
case of a natural herm okay that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: more of a natural herm with that with that
trait is dominant in that so that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: also pass off that dominant trait to the
offspring and many of those offspring are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna have or just like you said going to
flower and produce pollen sacks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you did mention through Instagram that
it's important to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: hermaphrodite trait what are some other
things that we should kind of know about
[SPEAKER_01]: that that you haven't talked about yet
just knowing and being able to ask the
[SPEAKER_01]: qualifying questions to a breeder so in
many cases you know growers they get the
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodite you know to get the hermy
hermaphrodite treat and they panic and
[SPEAKER_01]: they say oh what you know what's going on
you know the breed is blaming you they're
[SPEAKER_01]: blaming the lights they blame in the you
know they blame in the humidity or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment the you know the growers
like no it's you you got bad genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not stable so we have to find a
medium and the medium is education so if
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what to look for and you know
what to expect and you know why this may
[SPEAKER_01]: have hermied in the first place then you
you're in a much better position you know
[SPEAKER_01]: as to no one having to point the finger
and say because you say hey well maybe I
[SPEAKER_01]: might have let this female you know sit
for a little bit longer than I normally
[SPEAKER_01]: should have and you know I can tell that's
probably why I may have six or seven seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bud here but um or if you know you
you know you dealing with unstable
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics and that is a thing that is a
real thing and that's why when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with f1s and you know really
dealing with the unstable even with f2s
[SPEAKER_01]: we're dealing with a large variety of
genetics so you want to really do your
[SPEAKER_01]: best to take the time and be patient and
stabilize your genetics as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible so that uh it goes both ways and
you got to meet in the middle with
[SPEAKER_00]: education so okay that's good info
feminized seeds let's move on to them
[SPEAKER_00]: they're becoming more and more popular
people love to be able to plant a seed and
[SPEAKER_00]: just about always guaranteed just about
guaranteed that it's going to be female
[SPEAKER_00]: nine times out of ten or maybe nine point
nine times out of ten how do you create
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds um through reversing the
female and stopping the production of
[SPEAKER_01]: ethylene the ethylene once you stop it or
once you slow it down the female starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: create polysax and male parts and that's
that's what at that point we can typically
[SPEAKER_01]: pollinate a female and create feminized
seeds so all the offspring will be female
[SPEAKER_00]: offspring and there are several different
ways you can do that right do you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: touch into the different ways colloidal
silver gibralic acid can you talk to us
[SPEAKER_01]: about those ones yeah so uh colloidal
silver is probably the more popular one um
[SPEAKER_01]: something you can actually even make at
home i mean i don't make it myself i do uh
[SPEAKER_01]: typically make my own mixtures of
colloidal silver uh in gibralic acid i try
[SPEAKER_01]: different things but typically you can go
with uh 50 parts per million 40 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million colloidal silver which is uh
actually silver you know a silver and
[SPEAKER_01]: distilled water a little bit of
conductivity in there and then you got
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal silver um that's pretty much my
recommended method that is probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: most popular method in my opinion um so
it's pretty simple that's that's typically
[SPEAKER_01]: how most breeders will reverse a female
when would you apply that uh during i
[SPEAKER_01]: would start around two weeks three weeks
vegetative stage you want to start uh you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to start as early as possible you
want to hit the corners you want to hit as
[SPEAKER_01]: much it depends i mean how you're you know
you have different methods of reversing as
[SPEAKER_01]: well some breeders might just want to
reverse one plant i mean one branch rather
[SPEAKER_01]: i'm sorry one branch as to where uh you
know me typically i'll reverse the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: plant um so i start really early i just
start spraying the entire plant but if um
[SPEAKER_01]: you're more concerned about just one
branch then you might uh start just
[SPEAKER_01]: focusing on that one branch covering the
rest of it um and being able to spray that
[SPEAKER_01]: one branch about three weeks two to three
weeks and uh some people two to three four
[SPEAKER_01]: times a day it's kind of up to you and
it's really strain specific uh you know
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's pretty strain specific some some
strains are really hardy where they you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like to be reversed so you may have
to apply a stronger solution more more
[SPEAKER_01]: times per day and some are really
sensitive to it so but that's typically
[SPEAKER_00]: the method we use okay so you do it you're
spraying in veg and then you flip into
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering let them flower and still
continuing to spray or when do you stop
[SPEAKER_01]: that spray it depends on order flower or
photo period so in a case of an auto
[SPEAKER_01]: flower um you kind of know when she's
reversed uh once she starts growing those
[SPEAKER_01]: uh balls or pollen sex you can kind of you
can stop with you know and with the um a
[SPEAKER_01]: male or i'm sorry a photo period you want
to just um starting about three give it
[SPEAKER_01]: about three four weeks of uh about a month
of spray flip it to flower and um continue
[SPEAKER_01]: for about another two weeks and you should
see you know you should see the results
[SPEAKER_00]: probably within a week or two so basically
what we'll have in the plan we'll start
[SPEAKER_00]: producing nanners right and then you would
harvest the nanners or how does that or it
[SPEAKER_00]: would self-pollinate and then you would it
would just grow seeds on that particular
[SPEAKER_01]: plant well in the case of a reverse female
she's gonna grow actual pollen sex like a
[SPEAKER_01]: male would okay so you know we're actually
stopping the process of ethylene which um
[SPEAKER_01]: causes her to kind of turn into half male
so in that case it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: nanners nanners are always going to be
related to stress whether it's bad stress
[SPEAKER_01]: that we caused or whether it's stress that
the female caused on her own but um those
[SPEAKER_01]: um those we don't want to collect for we
don't want to collect nanners for uh
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen uh to use as um uh you know you
know we don't want to breed those we only
[SPEAKER_01]: want to breed male pollen sets balls so we
can kind of relate it to that if it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have balls if it's not balls then
we don't want to use it to breed gotcha
[SPEAKER_01]: how about gibberellic acid yeah i don't i
don't use it as much i don't i don't i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean i i use it a little bit in a mixture
that i've tried um that i'm working on but
[SPEAKER_01]: i don't i don't i don't recommend it uh i
would i only recommend colloidal silver um
[SPEAKER_01]: because um that's that's what i've always
used and that's what i'm always i'm just
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to try a new mixture but um i
mean either way i always go back to just
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal so we try we experiment with
different things all the time but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how we learn yep what's the best
way to stress a female without using
[SPEAKER_01]: chemicals hmm stress a female without
using chemicals if you want to um stress
[SPEAKER_00]: test stress in order to kind of get them
to i guess self-pollinate and create
[SPEAKER_01]: feminine seeds right okay so so a female
is going to self-pollinate on her own so
[SPEAKER_01]: for for anybody interested in um wanting
to um get into stabilize you know
[SPEAKER_01]: first-time breeders i would recommend
self-pollination being that ruralization
[SPEAKER_01]: is what what is the term ruralization is
where we typically will let the the female
[SPEAKER_01]: plant uh take a little bit longer than we
necessarily would and we'll end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: some seeds out of that so that's going to
be stable it's going to be 50 more stable
[SPEAKER_01]: the offspring than the mother plant was as
well as um you know it's a good way to
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of get your feet wet but we don't
ever want to uh stress a female out
[SPEAKER_01]: purposely to use her pollen to create uh
because if we can stress a female out and
[SPEAKER_01]: make her create nanas then that means that
her macroditic trait is dominant in her
[SPEAKER_01]: genes so we don't want it she's not
breeding stock in that case we want to put
[SPEAKER_01]: her to the side we don't want to use that
okay yeah that's interesting that was i
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to say that was a listener uh
question it was through instagram that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really good question because it does get
really tricky and that's why i always
[SPEAKER_01]: stress to um get as much education as we
can as far as the hermaphroditic trait and
[SPEAKER_01]: nanas and pollen sex and the difference
between the two and how nanas are created
[SPEAKER_01]: how pollen sex can be created and um how
they relate to feminized seeds because
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone loves feminized seeds it's like i
want feminized i want yeah you got
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized i want feminized and i'm like
you know you know sometimes i'm a pain
[SPEAKER_01]: because i'm like hey hey check this
article out you know if you don't know do
[SPEAKER_01]: you know about this and why why do you
really want feminized seeds you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: know do you understand that the risk in
the risk in feminized seeds because it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit of risk you know we're
dealing with hermaphroditic traits and so
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to go in and when you when you go
to a breeder and you're asking them for
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds i also want my my team to
be able to ask those follow-up questions
[SPEAKER_01]: well what generation has your feminized
seeds been bred to how long have you what
[SPEAKER_01]: are some of the traits that you breed for
within your feminized seeds what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: chances that they might i might get nanas
uh dorm early in the flower stage now you
[SPEAKER_01]: ask a breeder these type of questions and
i'm like hold up you know either they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be legitimate or they're going to
back off and say you know what i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want your business get out of here you
know and um that's that's the kind of we
[SPEAKER_01]: want that on both ends we want we want to
be educated makes sense yeah just one last
[SPEAKER_00]: thing on that last question uh this
particular person said that the question
[SPEAKER_00]: was how do you stress a female to herm
without using chemicals he had mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: he's been using light to do that he had
moved it from 1212 to 186 for a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: days and then back to 1212 so you're
saying that you shouldn't do that because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's stressing well you can do it so
we do that to to to look for sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: stability so that's the only time i use
light or heat in order to stress a female
[SPEAKER_01]: because i want to see if she's sexually
stable or not now if i know if i put light
[SPEAKER_01]: on her and she she's um she withstands it
and she doesn't hurt me then she's
[SPEAKER_01]: sexually stable so she's good breeding
stock but if i put light on her and heat
[SPEAKER_01]: on her and she turns out and i'm you know
i'm cutting her she's no good she's bad
[SPEAKER_01]: because if i use her to breed if i use
that pollen that was so easy to flip like
[SPEAKER_01]: that into a herm then that pollen is also
going to be uh or the offspring are also
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have that trait dominant within
their genes gotcha and you mentioned heat
[SPEAKER_00]: can you talk to us about a little bit more
like what how much heat like when do we
[SPEAKER_01]: apply it so and so forth in order to
stress it that way 80 85 and up i would
[SPEAKER_01]: say 89 90 90 and up is a good indicator of
heat stress you can go to 100 if you if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can but anything anything above 89 i
would say is typically 90 depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: your environment depending on the strain
everything is really strain related too
[SPEAKER_01]: you know especially we can get deep with
that endic and sativa you know related
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff and you know so it's so related to
that how how they handle heat and stresses
[SPEAKER_01]: but um yeah i would say 90s is a good uh
stressing but yeah light light is
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely a good stress that you can um
you can apply light and definitely flip
[SPEAKER_01]: flip a female to her but once she does
that she's no good good info okay good to
[SPEAKER_00]: know autoflower seeds another popular
thing autoflower more and more yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: so how do you create those seeds um same
way uh those are generally feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: most likely uh they they are regular as
well but the popularity uh popularity of
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized seeds and autoflower i've kind
of ran neck and neck so now we just got
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized autoflower everywhere and same
process we reverse a female uh with
[SPEAKER_01]: colloidal silver and uh use that pollen
collect that pollen it's a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: intricate like i said it's a much more uh
difficult process uh requires much more
[SPEAKER_01]: patience and much more time consuming but
um that's where you want to use a you know
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely have your tweezers handy and be
able to collect each individual pollen sac
[SPEAKER_01]: as they uh as they develop and um collect
as much pollen as possible to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use in store if it's even enough to store
but that's when it gets tricky autoflowers
[SPEAKER_00]: there's more and more seed banks that and
breeders that are releasing autoflowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't end it actually end up
being autoflowers so stability comes into
[SPEAKER_00]: question you know and and i heard you have
to breed multiple multiple levels down in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to stabilize what exactly does it
mean to stabilize a variety so to
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilize is simply just reducing genetic
variability just reducing variability
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately we want to achieve heterozygous
uh oh i'm sorry homozygous status we want
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve homo homozygosity in a sense
where uh uh that's just one phenotype uh
[SPEAKER_01]: two two particular one particular alleles
or one particular version per gene and um
[SPEAKER_01]: that is homozygous status that's what we
want to achieve uh three generations of
[SPEAKER_01]: selective breeding um we we uh we we dumb
it down to just one phenotype that's uh
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what it is to stabilize the strain
okay and then for autoflowers in
[SPEAKER_00]: particular i heard you need like i
mentioned you need to go down multiple
[SPEAKER_00]: generations is there is it like four
generations down or what was the do you
[SPEAKER_01]: know well either way um it's multiple
generations if you're stabilizing the
[SPEAKER_01]: strain you're never going to be able to
stabilize the strain without going down
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple uh f2 f3 f4 f5 you'll get to you
may get and that's the thing too so
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilize and is also in the sense of the
breeder uh what you may consider stable
[SPEAKER_01]: may not be stable to me so you may think
like hey i got my greens you know i got my
[SPEAKER_01]: vigor i got my big buds i'm stable you
know but most important is sexual
[SPEAKER_01]: stability we have to selective however
long it takes to selective breed an
[SPEAKER_01]: inbreed or line breed or inbred line ibl
in terms of what we call it ibl we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: go down that line and ibl for several
generations until we remove the
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphroditic trait as well as try to
catch all of the things that we like uh
[SPEAKER_01]: trichome develop or production uh you know
you may want purple buds as well but all
[SPEAKER_01]: of those are secondary to sexual stability
and sexual stability takes years that
[SPEAKER_01]: takes four five six seven generations you
can pick up on the cool stuff along the
[SPEAKER_01]: way but um until you run into that
roadblock of uh after about the eighth
[SPEAKER_01]: eight f8 uh f7 f8 you'll run into a
roadblock of our being technically sterile
[SPEAKER_01]: where um you're like okay now um i'm i'm
sexually stable uh but no further i can go
[SPEAKER_01]: that's when we back cross that's when we
go back to the parent uh we bring out that
[SPEAKER_01]: stored pollen and uh you know then we can
go back and re re-enter some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits that we loved in the beginning
that's the correct way to do it but yes
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to take years no matter what if
you want to have a good one it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: take years that makes sense good
information there okay so next one is
[SPEAKER_00]: another listener question it has to do
with the chart so i'm going to put this
[SPEAKER_00]: chart on the screen right now if you're
watching on youtube if you are on one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the podcast platforms maybe you can
explain it for them this chart that i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: showing right now you can see you know
from the top p1 male p1 female and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: goes down you get your f1s your f2s f3s
f4s f5s f6 and then actually it connects
[SPEAKER_00]: back to a p1 new generation first could
you explain this chart for us in layman's
[SPEAKER_01]: terms all right so so p1 is going to be
the parent uh the parent generation that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're starting off with uh mother
and father so that is um that is um where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're basically starting off the the
generation that the outcross of the mother
[SPEAKER_01]: and the father that is the start of their
generation and that's um that's those
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring are going to get us into f1 all
right those offspring are going to are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get us to f1 so the difference
between f1 and f2 is f1 is the start using
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents f2 is the actual start of the
line of the inbred line using the
[SPEAKER_01]: offspring so in this case when you see f2
f2 f2 that's when we've opened up to the
[SPEAKER_01]: most variety the most choices of of
choosing our phenotypes and our
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics and our aliases what we
call them our versions of what we that's
[SPEAKER_01]: when we start our selective breeding
process that f2 generation and then from
[SPEAKER_01]: there is what you pretty much see is the
selective process of him picking or
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever it is picking picking certain
offspring there and um you know breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: them together and as we go down we just
run into different generations uh at
[SPEAKER_01]: attempts to stabilize the strain you got a
and these are all um characteristics that
[SPEAKER_01]: are being uh selectively bred for uh we go
down in the f4 f4 so yeah he kind of stops
[SPEAKER_01]: in f6 and that's typically uh at that
point where i would generally back cross
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the parent and that's where you
see p1 all over again so it's funny that's
[SPEAKER_01]: how we spoke just about that right before
so that was that's cool really cool chart
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's genetic mapping right there
that's what we use for uh you know for
[SPEAKER_00]: reference gotcha gotcha so definitely a
good chart to have on hand absolutely the
[SPEAKER_00]: question that had in regards to this chart
is if two parents are bred together which
[SPEAKER_00]: level of generational offspring will show
the strongest level of expressions and
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes okay so that is a awesome
question but we're not necessarily going
[SPEAKER_01]: to so what so you'll get the most variety
in the f2 generation so you'll probably
[SPEAKER_01]: find your your best options and your
strongest terpenes and variety right there
[SPEAKER_01]: in the f2 generation because you'll have
more to choose from okay that's where
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where that's what we want to start
our hunt for that's what we want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: looking in the f2s a lot of people think
it's f1s that are you know i mean i think
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the misinformation that was
passed around yeah it shows you right here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the chart you can see the f1 is um only
limited amount of offspring compared to f2
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a wide variety we kind of open up
the gene pool at that point and um we get
[SPEAKER_01]: such a wide selection and that's where we
start the selective breeding process to
[SPEAKER_01]: say hey because we're going to get
instability as well we get a wide variety
[SPEAKER_01]: where we get instability so now we have to
focus on selective breeding and making
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that we stabilize or work towards
stabilizing by picking the right picking
[SPEAKER_00]: the right uh the right offspring now
what's your opinion on breeders releasing
[SPEAKER_00]: f1s versus releasing f2s versus you know
is there something that they should only
[SPEAKER_00]: release stability purposes for example do
you feel like in your opinion that
[SPEAKER_00]: breeders should only release stable
genetics that are you know f5s f6s or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that's a good question but i
can't say that i would suggest people only
[SPEAKER_01]: because we need genetics too we need we we
need to experience you know we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience so um if everything was stable
it's like that would be a perfect world
[SPEAKER_01]: right we don't want to live in a perfect
world we want to be able to um experience
[SPEAKER_01]: these things and um apply some of the
education that we that we learned uh into
[SPEAKER_01]: right right there hands-on and to be able
to do that you know i don't i don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: anything against f1s but you gotta educate
like me personally i uh you know i i
[SPEAKER_01]: educate my people and say hey this you
know this is an f1 typically i only offer
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a certain way typically like an
auction or something like that but um and
[SPEAKER_01]: when i do you know i make sure that they
understand like hey you know and it's sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of like what i did with dogs you know if i
sold your puppy i'm like man hey you gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: send me pictures or you know you like you
know i'm calling every week they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: all right man she's good you know but
that's kind of same way with the genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: you know you want to it's like your
offspring or your children you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of want to follow up and make sure
that the new parents they're okay they're
[SPEAKER_01]: well taken care of and that they don't run
into any issues so typically when you do
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's not a problem giving out f1s you
just got to keep a good relationship and
[SPEAKER_00]: customer service is always first okay
that's a good answer talking about dogs i
[SPEAKER_00]: want to touch on this real quick it
doesn't have to be a long answer but can
[SPEAKER_00]: you tell us like some of the things that
are the same for dog breeding and plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding and then also some things that
are different for dog breeding versus
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeding yeah for sure um literally
when it comes to the the genetics of it
[SPEAKER_01]: everything is exactly the same besides
being able to reverse that's literally the
[SPEAKER_01]: only thing that's different um even when
we come down to cloning um you can you can
[SPEAKER_01]: clone a puppy especially uh nowadays
that's why eventually we're evolving into
[SPEAKER_01]: the tissue culture and um people clone
puppies using tissue culture and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: through through our gardening we'll
eventually start to see people preferably
[SPEAKER_01]: creating their cones through tissue
culture because you can store it for much
[SPEAKER_01]: longer um it's that much similar to where
there's only literally one um difference
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as that that i can tell reversing
being able to reverse a female i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really know anything else that's different
xy chromosomes everything's literally the
[SPEAKER_01]: same um even some of the terminology um
that i learned years ago through you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it connected and i'm like wow okay like
hybrid vigor and it is a different term in
[SPEAKER_01]: the dog world but it means sort of the
same thing um in the plant world that's
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting yeah i was just curious on
that one so i have a few more questions
[SPEAKER_00]: for you what advice do you have for
someone who's a beginner breeder or
[SPEAKER_01]: someone who is considering starting to
breed have fun man have fun don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: discouraged understanding is going to take
your time um understand that uh you
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely are going to have to have a
passion for you got to have a love for it
[SPEAKER_01]: because this is literally your life's work
so and when you look at it as your life's
[SPEAKER_01]: work and you have fun with it at the same
time nothing else really matters man you
[SPEAKER_01]: know do it for fun do it for your own
personal use for your own medicine for
[SPEAKER_01]: your own for your own love you know your
love of it the love of the gardening and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know you'll be fine i like that i
think that's really good advice for sure
